<h1>DID GOD DIE<br />FOR YOU?</h1>

<hr />


<p class="q"><a name="Q1"></a>Q. That&rsquo;s a very unusual question.  Why would it be necessary for
God to die for me?</p>

<p class="a">A. The reason for this is because the Bible tells us that due
to mankind&rsquo;s sin, all men are subject to death&mdash;the second death of eternal
damnation:</p>

<p class="verse">For the wages of sin is death;&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 6:23a</p>

<p class="verse">And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it,&hellip; And I
saw the dead, small and great, stand before God;&hellip;   And death and hell were
cast into the lake of fire.  This is the second death.</p>

<p class="verseref">Revelation 20:11,12,14</p>

<p>But God has developed a plan of
salvation in which He has determined to save some (not all) out of the human
race, by taking their sins upon Himself and dying in their stead.  He becomes
their substitute.  Amazingly, the Gospel of the Bible declares that God took
the sins of certain rebellious sinners and paid the penalty equivalent to each
one of them spending an eternity in Hell:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son,&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 5:10a</p>

<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that
we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye
were healed<b>. </b></p>

<p class="verseref">1 Peter 2:24</p>

<p>God (in the Person of Jesus Christ) experienced 
punishment for sin equivalent to those He came to save spending an eternity in
Hell.  This is the atoning death that God died for a portion of mankind, known
as His elect, which completely satisfied the demands of the Law of God:</p>

<p class="verse">He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear
their iniquities.</p>

<p class="verseref">Isaiah 53:11</p>

<p>Once the sin debt is paid in full,
there is no longer any possibility that the people of God will stand for
judgment on the last day.  They are freed from the penalty of the law:</p>

<p class="verse">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 8:1</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q2"></a>Q. Well, I think it is an amazing idea to contemplate
God &ldquo;dying&rdquo; and especially His experiencing Hell for some people; but before
that, I must admit that I do not even know if He exists.  How can anyone really
know if God exists?</p>

<p class="a">A. Some men do make the claim that there is no God; or, that
they are not sure if He exists.  However, the existence of God does not rely on
man&rsquo;s opinion at all.  The Bible states as an undeniable fact that God is
absolutely real:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>

<p class="verseref">Genesis 1:1</p>

<p>The world around us is continually
testifying to the fact that there was (and is) a Creator who made and sustains
all things.  Nature is loudly proclaiming to each one of us that there was a
Master designer behind it all:</p>

<p class="verse">The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handiwork.  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.  There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</p>

<p class="verseref">Psalm 19:1-3</p>

<p>You see, deep down within, each human
being knows there is a God; and they also know that they are in trouble with
this God:</p>

<p class="verse">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for
God hath shewed it unto them.   For the invisible things of him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 1:19,20</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q3"></a>Q. I have to agree with you that as I have seen
beautiful flowers and wonderful creatures, I also have thought from time to
time that a god must have made all this; but often, I puzzle over the question,
&ldquo;Which god?&rdquo;  Many religions claim their god is true.  Which god is correct?</p>

<p class="a">A. You have asked an excellent question.  The world is full
of religions and their particular gods, and many of their ideas about the
nature of God conflict.  But the Bible does teach us that we can know with
certainty the One and only true God:  </p>

<p class="verse">I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:  that they may know from the
rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me.  I Am the
LORD, and there is none else.</p>

<p class="verseref">Isaiah 45:5,6</p>

<p class="verse">Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their
graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.   Tell ye, and bring them
near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient
time?  Who hath told it from that time? Have not I the LORD?  And there is no
God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.   Look
unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is
none else.</p>

<p class="verseref">Isaiah 45:20-22</p>

<p>The Bible declares that Jesus Christ
is this <span class="underline">only</span> possible Saviour:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,&hellip;   Neither is there
salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved.</p>

<p class="verseref">Acts 4:10a,12</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q4"></a>Q. Are you saying that Jesus is Lord and God?</p>

<p class="a">A. Yes!  The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is the God of
the Bible, manifested in the flesh:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.    And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us,&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">John 1:1,14</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q5"></a>Q. But isn&rsquo;t Jesus called the &ldquo;Son of God&rdquo;?  And if
he is a son, then there must be a father.   How many gods are there?</p>

<p class="a">A. Yes, it is true that Jesus is called the &ldquo;Son of God&rdquo;. 
However, the Bible unquestionably declares that Jesus is eternal God.  The
Bible also teaches that the Father is the eternal God.  The truth is that the
Person of God is too complex for us mere men (since we are creatures of limited
intelligence) to try to figure out:  </p>

<p class="verse">For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</p>

<p class="verseref">Colossians 2:9</p>

<p class="verse">But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
ever:</p>

<p class="verseref">Hebrews 1:8</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;unto <span class="underline">God and his Father</span>; to him be glory and dominion
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class="verseref">Revelation 1:6</p>

<p>God reveals Himself as three Persons,
yet He insists that He is only One God:</p>

<p class="verse">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</p>

<p class="verseref">1 John 5:7</p>

<p class="verse">Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD.</p>

<p class="verseref">Deuteronomy 6:4</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q6"></a>Q. You seem to refer to and quote the Bible a lot for
what you say, but I&rsquo;ve heard that the Bible is just a very old book written by
men?</p>

<p class="a">A. It is true that the Bible is an ancient book, but it is
absolutely not the word of men.  God moved prophets to write down words
directly from His own mouth.  In this way, God utilized these men as scribes to
record His communication to mankind:</p>

<p class="verse">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any
private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of
man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class="verseref">2 Peter 1:20,21</p>

<p class="verse">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>

<p class="verseref">2 Timothy 3:16</p>

<p>Thus, the whole Bible is the Word of
God.  Every Word of God is pure and holy and can be trusted entirely.  The
Bible is the ultimate and final authority in all that it declares. </p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q7"></a>Q. To tell you the truth, I really do not
understand&mdash;since I am not that bad of a person&mdash;why it would be necessary for
God to die for me?</p>

<p class="a">A. The terrible reality is that all men have fallen into sin
and have broken the Law of God.  You see, according to God&rsquo;s Lawbook the Bible,
all men are desperately bad and wicked:</p>

<p class="verse">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 3:12</p>

<p class="verse">The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
who can know it?</p>

<p class="verseref">Jeremiah 17:9</p>

<p>God is perfect, just, and holy&mdash;He
demands absolute obedience to all of His commandments.  Failure to obey even
one is enough to bring upon us His awful wrath:</p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.</p>

<p class="verseref">James 2:10</p>

<p>If we are honest with ourselves, we
must admit that we (along with every other person) have sinned:</p>

<p class="verse">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.</p>

<p class="verseref">1 John 1:8</p>

<p class="verse">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 3:23</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p>

<p class="verseref">Ezekiel 18:4b</p>

<p>As we saw earlier, the Biblical
principle is that the penalty for sin is death; and the death that God has in
view is the second death of suffering an eternal damnation in Hell.</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q8"></a>Q. Do you really think that God will throw people
into Hell?</p>

<p class="a">A. Yes.  Sin is extremely offensive to God.  Sin is so ugly
to the infinitely holy God that He must punish forever those who disobey His
Laws:  </p>

<p class="verse">For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
foundations of the mountains.</p>

<p class="verseref">Deuteronomy 32:22</p>

<p class="verse">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.</p>

<p class="verseref">Matthew 25:46</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q9"></a>Q. Are you saying that a person given the sentence of
Hell must suffer forever?</p>

<p class="a">A. Horribly, we must say that the answer is yes! The Bible
teaches that once sinners are placed in Hell, they will never get out.  It is
eternal:</p>

<p class="verse">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:   Who shall be punished with
everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of
his power;</p>

<p class="verseref">2 Thessalonians 1:8,9</p>

<p class="verse">And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched:    Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched.   And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched:   Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched.</p>

<p class="verseref">Mark 9:43-46</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q10"></a>Q. The way you talk about God is alarming.  I
thought Christians believed in a kind and gentle God who loved everyone.  Is
God as frightful as you describe?</p>

<p class="a">A. God is loving and merciful; but He is also holy and just
and holds men created in His image accountable for their transgressions against
His Law.  True Bible believers desire to warn others, because God indeed is to
be feared:</p>

<p class="verse">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">2 Corinthians 5:11a</p>

<p class="verse">God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and
is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth
wrath for his enemies.</p>

<p class="verseref">Nahum 1:2</p>

<p class="verse">For our God is a consuming fire.</p>

<p class="verseref">Hebrews 12:29</p>

<p class="verse">Fear ye not me? saith  the LORD: will ye not tremble at my
presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual
decree, that it cannot pass it:... </p>

<p class="verseref">Jeremiah 5:22a</p>

<p>The idea of a smiling, docile Jesus,
happy with all people, is presented by many churches today.  But that idea is
totally false.  Jesus Christ is angry with the sins of mankind and it is He
that will be seated upon the judgment throne on the last day to condemn the
ungodly and to pronounce the final judgment of an eternity in Hell:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>

<p class="verseref">Psalm 7:11b</p>

<p class="verse">Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will <span class="underline">judge
the world</span> in righteousness <span class="underline">by that man</span> whom he hath ordained;
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from
the dead.</p>

<p class="verseref">Acts 17:31</p>

<p class="verse">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad<b>.</b></p>

<p class="verseref">2 Corinthians 5:10</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q11"></a>Q. I know that from the sound of it, I would very
much like to avoid going to Hell.  What do I have to do to not go there?</p>

<p class="a">A. You must understand that our (mankind&rsquo;s) situation is not
good.  Because of our sin, we cannot respond obediently to the Gospel call to
repent and believe.  We are spiritually dead and therefore incapable of
performing any work that could bring us salvation:</p>

<p class="verse">And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins:</p>

<p class="verseref">Ephesians 2:1</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>

<p class="verseref">Galatians 2:16b</p>

<p>Actually, the Bible indicates that
salvation is completely impossible for men to obtain by their own doing.   Only
God can save a sinner:</p>

<p class="verse">When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
saying, Who then can be saved?  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With
men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>

<p class="verseref">Matthew 19:25,26</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q12"></a>Q. Are you saying I am going to Hell regardless of
what I do.  Is there no hope?</p>

<p class="a">A. Yes there is hope.  The hope rests in God.  He must do all
the work in the matter of saving you:</p>

<p class="verse">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:  <span class="underline">Which were born</span>,
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but <span class="underline">of
God</span>.</p>

<p class="verseref">John 1:12,13</p>

<p class="verse">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

<p class="verseref">John 6:44</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q13"></a>Q. I don&rsquo;t think that I understand very well how God
saves people.  Who are those that He has mercy on?  And how can I be one that
receives this mercy?</p>

<p class="a">A. The reality is that since man cannot do anything to save
himself, God developed a salvation plan according to election.  He chose one
here and one there, solely based upon His own good pleasure.  It is not man&rsquo;s
good works that save him, but it is the completed work of the Lord Jesus Christ
that saves him:</p>

<p class="verse">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having
predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>

<p class="verseref">Ephesians 1:4,5</p>

<p class="verse">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">John 15:16a</p>

<p class="verse">(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any
good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
works, but of him that calleth;)  It was said unto her, The elder shall serve
the younger.  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 9:11-13</p>

<p class="verse">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God
that justifieth.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 8:33</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q14"></a>Q. But how do I know if I am one of God&rsquo;s elect or
not?</p>

<p class="a">A. You may be one of God&rsquo;s elect or you may not&mdash;only God
knows those He intends to save; therefore we have to leave the question of &ldquo;election&rdquo;
completely to the sovereign will of God.   We may, however, go to Him in
prayer.  God does permit us to approach Him humbly (acknowledging our sins and
our condition of being under His wrath) in order that we may enter a plea for
pardon:</p>

<p class="verse">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to
me a sinner.</p>

<p class="verseref">Luke 18:13</p>

<p class="verse">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

<p class="verseref">Hebrews 4:16</p>

<p>Sinners should be encouraged by the
Person of God.  He is a God of mercy.  Crying for mercy is a privilege that God
allows us.  Just as a rebel condemned to die, we may beseech the glorious King
of Heaven for a pardon for our sins (only for Christ&rsquo;s sake):</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in
mercy.</p>

<p class="verseref">Micah 7:18b</p>

<p class="verse">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.  And many charged him
that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, thou son of
David, have mercy on me.</p>

<p class="verseref">Mark 10:47,48</p>

<p>Jesus heard the blind beggar&rsquo;s pleas
for mercy and gave him his physical sight.  This lets us know that Christ is
most compassionate and merciful towards sinners.</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q15"></a>Q. Will crying for mercy then save me from Hell?</p>

<p class="a">A. We have to be careful.  There is no formula to obtain
salvation.  It is in His hands entirely:</p>

<p class="verse">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 9:15</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q16"></a>Q. I think I will go to God and ask Him for mercy. 
How long do you think it will be before God answers me?</p>

<p class="a">A. We cannot set any time limit upon God, my friend.  God
will save an individual (if it is His good pleasure to do so) in His own time
and manner:</p>

<p class="verse">I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
hope.</p>

<p class="verseref">Psalm 130:5</p>

<p class="verse">It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verseref">Lamentations 3:26</p>

<p class="verse">Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</p>

<p class="verseref">Psalm 123:2</p>

<p>We must wait upon God to do the work
of salvation.  However, as you wait on the Lord to save you, be aware that
salvation is an urgent matter.  This is because none of us know the day of our
death.  Our days may be very few.  Also, many true believers are learning from
the Bible that the time has grown extremely short for the return of the Lord
Jesus Christ and the destruction of this world:</p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be
burned up.</p>

<p class="verseref">2 Peter 3:10</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q17"></a>Q. Do you think the world will end very soon?</p>

<p class="a">A. In all probability we will shortly see the Lord&rsquo;s return:</p>

<p class="verse">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>

<p class="verseref">1 Thessalonians 4:16-18</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q18"></a>Q. Should I find a Christian church and begin
attending services while I wait for God to save me?</p>

<p class="a">A. Absolutely not!  God is finished with the churches and
congregations of the world because the age of the church has come to an end. 
We are living at a time of great tribulation when God&rsquo;s judgment is upon all
denominations&mdash;whether Catholic or Protestant&mdash;all churches everywhere in the
world are under the judgment of God for their failure to obey God&rsquo;s Word:</p>

<p class="verse">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
God:&hellip;</p>

<p class="verseref">1 Peter 4:17a</p>

<p>In fact, God is commanding all
Christians everywhere to come out of the corporate church:</p>

<p class="verse">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues.</p>

<p class="verseref">Revelation 18:4</p>

<p><span class="underline">God is not saving anyone within the
churches today</span>. So the last place a Christian would want to be today is in
a church.  But He is saving a great number of people outside of the churches
during our day:</p>

<p class="verse">After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man
could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people,&hellip; &hellip;These are they which
came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb.</p>

<p class="verseref">Revelation 7:9,14</p>

<p class="q"><a name="Q19"></a>Q. If I do not go to a Christian church, then how
can I find salvation?</p>

<p class="a">A. It is through the Bible that God works out His salvation.
Therefore we want to be reading the Bible as much as possible.  He saves
individuals by the hearing of the Word of God:</p>

<p class="verse">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</p>

<p class="verseref">John 6:63</p>

<p class="verse">So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>

<p class="verseref">Romans 10:17</p>

<p class="verse">O how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day.</p>

<p class="verseref">Psalm 119:97</p>
