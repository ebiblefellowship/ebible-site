<h2>The Bible Reveals</h2>
<h1><span class="underline">WE CAN KNOW</span></h1>
<h2>May 21, 2011</h2>
<h2>is Judgment Day!</h2>

<hr />

<p class="text1">Upon hearing the information that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day, many in the churches immediately refer to a Bible verse such as:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Matthew 24:36</span> But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not
the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>

<p class="text1">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; they say after quoting this verse, &ldquo;the Bible
tells us that no man can know.&rdquo;  They might even add, &ldquo;Not even Jesus Himself
knows the time; therefore, your date of May 21 is all wrong.&rdquo;  As is often the
case after quickly making this statement and dismissing the information
regarding the date of the end of the world, this individual will go on his or
her way content that this will never happen.  &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; they think, &ldquo;the
Bible says we cannot know the timing of the end.&rdquo; </p>

<p class="text1">Of course, we do acknowledge that the Bible has this verse
within it.  However, the question is: does the rest of the Bible support the
idea that we cannot know the timing of the end of the world?  Or, is there more
information in the Bible that would allow for God&rsquo;s people to learn the date of
the end of the world?</p>

<p class="text1">First of all, we need to quickly mention that Jesus Christ
is God Almighty. And since Jesus is Almighty God, there can be no question that
He knows when the end of the world will be.  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Job 24:1</span> &hellip;times are not hidden from the Almighty&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">The purpose of this pamphlet is to show from the Bible that
since we have now reached the last days of earth&rsquo;s history, it is (and always
has been) God&rsquo;s plan to reveal information from the Bible concerning the end of
the world, including its exact timing.  For instance, we see this idea in the
following passage of Scripture:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:4</span>  But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the
book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
shall be increased.</p>

<p class="text1">According to this verse, God shut up the words and sealed
the Book (the Bible) until the time of the end.  Because the Bible&rsquo;s
information was sealed up, no man could know the timing of the end of the
world.  But the strong implication of Daniel&nbsp;12:4 is that the seals would
be taken off once the time period of the end is reached.  Furthermore, once the
end of time does come about, &ldquo;knowledge shall be increased.&rdquo; 
Matthew&nbsp;24:36 declares that no one knows &ldquo;but My Father only.&rdquo;  God has
always known the timing of the end of the world.  Since God Himself is the
author of the Bible, it was no problem for Him to place this information and
hide it within the Bible where it would lie dormant until the proper point in
history was reached.  Since we have now arrived at the end of the world, God is
now revealing these things to His people.  </p>

<h4><span class="underline">WHY THE CHURCHES WILL NOT UNDERSTAND</span></h4>

<p class="text1">If you speak with your pastor about this date of May 21, 2011 being Judgment Day, it is almost certain that he will be opposed to this
fact.  It is amazing how much in unison the churches are in declaring &ldquo;no man
knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  However, none should take comfort from their unified
stand because, without question, the churches of our modern day have greatly
fallen away from truth.  The churches of the world disagree and teach contrary
to one another on numerous points of the Bible&rsquo;s teachings (which means that
they must have errors in their conclusions).  Therefore, it ought not to be
particularly comforting for the churches to finally have unity of agreement on
the point of &ldquo;no man knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  Rather, it ought to be alarming,
especially as we realize that in our day God&rsquo;s judgment is upon the churches of
the world due to their unfaithfulness:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">1 Peter 4:17</span> For the time is come that judgment must begin at
the house of God&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">The horrible truth is that the Lord Himself has abandoned
the churches of the world.  The Bible teaches us that the church age is over
(it ended in 1988 A.D.).  The Lord has left the churches in spiritual
darkness.  They cannot see the awful truth that we are now at the very end of the
world.  The Lord vividly describes the spiritual leaders of the churches today
in Isaiah:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Isaiah 56:10-11</span> His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant,
they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark&hellip;they are shepherds that cannot
understand&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">God Himself indicates that many who profess to be His people
will not see the warning signs of the coming end.  The Lord uses Old Testament
Israel/Judah as types and figures of the New Testament churches and
congregations.</p>

<p class="text1">The Bible points out that God was angry with Old Testament Judah
and forewarned them of His intent to judge them, but Judah dismissed and
ignored these warnings until they were destroyed&mdash;much like the churches of
today are doing:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Jeremiah 8:7</span> Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle
and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but <span class="underline">my
people know not the judgment of the LORD</span>.</p>

<p class="text1">Now at the end, the New Testament churches are repeating the
same errors that Old Testament Israel committed.  They are dismissing the
warnings of God (from the Bible), exactly as Israel dismissed the warnings of
God through the prophets whom the Lord sent to them.</p>

<h4><span class="underline">GOD ALWAYS FOREWARNS HIS PEOPLE</span></h4>

<p class="text1">It is now time for us to look at other information in the
Bible that your church or pastor probably would not want you to consider; but
in order to prove that we can know the timing of the end, we must first see
what the rest of the Bible has to say about it.  For instance, God makes this
statement in the book of Amos, chapter 3:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Amos 3:7</span>  Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth
his secret unto his servants the prophets.</p>

<p class="text1">Spiritually speaking, a prophet is anyone who declares the
Word of God.  An individual believer therefore fulfills the role of a prophet
as we share the Gospel with other people.  The Lord is telling us in Amos&nbsp;3:7
that He discloses information to His people.  He says that He will indeed &ldquo;do
nothing&rdquo; without first revealing &ldquo;His secret unto His servants.&rdquo;  As we review
the Bible&rsquo;s history, we actually do see this important truth in evidence again
and again. </p>

<p class="text1">Let us take a look at the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 6:3,5,7</span> And the LORD said&hellip;his days shall be an hundred
and twenty years&hellip;And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually&hellip;And the LORD said, I will destroy man&hellip; </p>

<p class="text1">In this account, we find that God gave the world 120 years
before He would destroy it.  This time was necessary as the Lord selected Noah
to build the ark and to accomplish the task of warning the world during those
120 years.  The Bible identifies Noah as a &ldquo;preacher of righteousness&rdquo; (<i>2&nbsp;Peter
2:5</i>).  His work of constructing the ark all those long years would
certainly not have gone unnoticed.  The building of the ark was a great
testimony of faith in God, and the ark&rsquo;s existence and development also served
as a constant condemnation of the world itself:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Hebrews 11:7</span> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not
seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by
the which he condemned the world, and became heir of&hellip;righteousness&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">It was in this 120<sup>th</sup> year (4990 B.C.) that the
Lord once again gave Noah more information concerning the timing of the flood. 
Only this time, God gave very specific information.  </p>

<p class="text1">Incredibly, prior to the flood&rsquo;s occurrence, God told Noah
the precise year, month, and day of the coming deluge:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:1,4,10-11</span> And the LORD said unto Noah&hellip;For yet seven days, and I will cause it
to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights&hellip;And it came to pass after
seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. In the six
hundredth year of Noah's life, <span class="underline">in the second month, the seventeenth day of
the month</span>&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">It is no coincidence that in our present day God&rsquo;s people
know that the end will come in the year 2011 (exactly 7,000 years after the
flood), in the month of May, and on the 21<sup>st</sup> day.  This parallels
exactly what the Lord had told Noah.  Remember also that May 21 in 2011 is the
17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of the Hebrew calendar, the
equivalent date to when the flood began and when the Lord shut Noah and his
family into the ark.  Also, we should remember that Jesus refers to the flood
as an example of His own coming:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Matthew 24:38-39</span> For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into
the ark,  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; <span class="underline">so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be</span>.</p>

<p class="text1">Christ&rsquo;s coming will be as it was in the days of Noah.  The
question that anyone honestly seeking truth must now ask is: did anyone know
anything about the approaching flood before it came?  Or, did no man know the
day or timing of the flood?  The Bible&rsquo;s answer is: yes, God&rsquo;s people knew. 
Noah knew.  Noah&rsquo;s wife knew.  Noah&rsquo;s three sons and their wives knew.  The
world around them also knew about it since Noah was a preacher.  However,
without doubt, they wrote Noah off as a lunatic.  As a result, they all
perished in the flood.  A key point that the Bible makes is that all kinds of
people hear this warning that God sends out, but only His elect people respond
to it and take action.  Therefore, concerning the horrible death toll of the
flood of Noah&rsquo;s day, it is important that we take note of this verse:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">2 Peter 2:5</span> And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a
preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the <span class="underline">ungodly</span>;</p>

<p class="text1">The Lord stresses that the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day destroyed all
of the people who were &ldquo;<span class="underline">ungodly</span>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="text1">This is an extremely important fact.  All of God&rsquo;s (saved)
people were informed of the flood and delivered from death.  Each of the
righteous knew that it was coming and were able to get into the ark, along with
Noah.  We can be sure that God also warned the rest of the people of the world
of Noah&rsquo;s day, but they did not believe the things that Noah was declaring to
them.  In other words, we see the Biblical principle stated in Amos&nbsp;3:7 in
view.  The Lord forewarned His people.  The rest of the people heard, but
ultimately ignored God&rsquo;s warnings.  As a result, they were caught off-guard and
perished.  This is the reason why the Bible says that Christ will come like &ldquo;a
thief in the night.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="text1">The fact that God forewarned Noah and his family, by itself,
should cause us to pause and realize that the Lord will likewise reveal the
timing of the end before Judgment Day comes.  However, there is much more for
us to consider with God&rsquo;s workings in Biblical history.  </p>

<p class="text1">Let us take a look at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. 
Before destroying the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord visited Abraham
and revealed His plan of judgment upon those cities.  Significantly, we read:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 18:16-17</span> &hellip;the men&hellip;looked toward  Sodom&hellip; And the LORD
said, <span class="underline">Shall I hide from Abraham</span> that thing which I do;</p>

<p class="text1">God did not hide His plan to destroy Sodom from Abraham. 
The Lord thought it good to share this information with His servant.  Once
informed, Abraham began to intercede (pray) for the righteous within the city. 
Abraham&rsquo;s nephew Lot lived in Sodom.  The Bible tells us that Lot was a
righteous man (that is, God had saved him and made him righteous through
Christ&mdash;<i>see 2 Peter 2:7-8</i>).</p>

<p class="text1">God could not destroy the righteous with the wicked.  So the
Lord had to act.  God warned Lot concerning the coming judgment:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 19:12-13</span> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any
besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters&hellip;bring them out of this
place:  For we will destroy this place&hellip;the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</p>

<p class="text1">Lot and a few members of his family escaped the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah only because the Lord Himself gave him advance warning,
information that Lot attempted to share with his sons-in-law but they did not
take him seriously (<i>Genesis 19:14</i>).  We also need to consider that Jesus
says that His coming will be as it was in the days of Lot:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Luke 17:28-30</span> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they
did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son
of man is revealed.</p>

<p class="text1">The truth is that in the days of Lot, God warned His people
in advance of the awful judgment upon Sodom.  Also, others being warned did not
take action on the advance information that they had been given.  The
historical fact that God forewarned Abraham and Lot once again demonstrates
that the Lord will likewise reveal the timing of the end before Judgment Day
comes, and yet there is still more Scripture for us to consider.  </p>

<h4><span class="underline">A THIEF IN THE NIGHT</span></h4>

<p class="text1">Many professing Christians wrongly think that Jesus will
come &ldquo;as a thief&rdquo; to bless them and then give them their reward of eternal
life.  But where do people get the idea that a thief comes to bring blessings? 
The Bible tells us exactly what it is that a thief comes to do:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">John 10:10</span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill,
and to destroy&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">Jesus does not come unexpectedly like a thief for His elect
people (typified by Noah, Abraham, Lot, etc.), but <i><span class="underline">He comes as a thief
for all of the unsaved of the world</span></i>:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</span> For yourselves know perfectly that the day
of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace
and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman
with child; and they shall not escape.</p>

<p class="text1">Since the Lord is describing &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo; coming
upon them and declaring that &ldquo;they shall not escape,&rdquo; it is very clear that the
&ldquo;ungodly&rdquo; are in view.  It is for them that Christ comes &ldquo;as a thief&rdquo; to kill
and destroy.  But notice the next verse:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">1 Thessalonians 5:4</span> But ye, <span class="underline">brethren, are not in darkness, that that day
should overtake you as a thief</span>. </p>

<p class="text1">Obviously, we see that God&rsquo;s people will not be taken by
surprise.  How could they be since the Lord does nothing without first warning
His people?  God warned Noah.  God warned Abraham.  God warned Lot.  How could
anyone think that God would warn His people in these lesser types of Judgment
Day and not follow His own pattern and warn the world of about 7 billion souls
living at the time of the actual Day of Judgment?  Additionally, we find that
Jesus commanded all to &ldquo;watch&rdquo; for they knew not what hour He might come. 
Christ comes as a thief only to those who are not watching:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Revelation 3:3</span> &hellip;<span class="underline">If</span> therefore <span class="underline">thou shalt not watch</span>, I will come on thee as a
thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p>

<p class="text1">That is, Christ commanded the true believers to keep looking
(watching) in the Bible.  His people were to keep studying the Word of God. 
This is because at the proper time He would open up our eyes to understand the
words that were sealed.  Since any keeping watch would understand these things,
Christ would not come &ldquo;as a thief in the night&rdquo; for them.  Jesus comes &ldquo;as a
thief&rdquo; only for those who insist that we cannot know the time of Christ&rsquo;s
coming.  By insisting that it is not possible to know the time, the churches
are indicating that they are in darkness and have no intention of watching.  It
is deadly serious for anyone to stubbornly insist that we cannot know the
timing of the end.  This is because when Jesus does come upon them, it will be
like &ldquo;a thief&rdquo; and they will be suddenly destroyed and not escape the awful
judgment of God.  This is all very sorrowful; however, the Lord gives each one
of us strong encouragement through the Biblical example of the Ninevites.  The
people of Nineveh also heard God&rsquo;s warning of an approaching judgment. </p>

<h4><span class="underline">THE CASE OF THE NINEVITES</span></h4>

<p class="text1">God sent the prophet Jonah to Nineveh in order to bring an
incredible message containing one single sentence:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Jonah 3:4</span>  Jonah&hellip;cried, and said, <span class="underline">Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown</span>. </p>

<p class="text1">It was only a few words!  That was the entire message that
Jonah was commanded by God to bring to the inhabitants of Nineveh.  A message
that basically contained two elements: <span class="underline">time</span> (<i>40 days</i>) and <span class="underline">judgment</span>
(<i>overthrown</i>).  Of course, this true historical account of the Lord
sending Jonah to warn the Ninevites underscores, once again, God&rsquo;s pattern in
the Bible of forewarning people prior to bringing His wrath upon them.  It is
absolutely amazing what we find in the very next verse:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Jonah 3:5</span> So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip; </p>

<p class="text1">Look at this from man&rsquo;s perspective.  The Ninevites were
Assyrians.  Jonah was not an Assyrian.  He did not naturally speak their
language.  Not only was he from another nation, it was an enemy nation. 
Suddenly this strange man appeared proclaiming, &ldquo;<b><i>Yet forty days, and </i></b><b><i>Nineveh</i></b><b><i>
shall be overthrown.</i></b>&rdquo; </p>

<p class="text1">Can you think of any other responses that the Ninevites
might have had instead, such as mockery, or laughter, or total disbelief?  In
our modern world, we would think, &ldquo;Only a gullible fool would believe such a
message!&rdquo;  Yes, we can easily think of many reasons today why a person would
not believe something so ridiculous, but the Ninevites believed.  What could
have possibly convinced the Ninevites that this horrible news was true and was
really from God?  Certainly, it was not the volume of evidence.  Jonah did not
come with an encyclopedia of studies of teachings from the Bible and lay them
at the doorstep of the city of Nineveh.  No!  He only spoke a single
sentence&mdash;the flimsiest of evidence&mdash;and yet they believed:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Matthew 12:41</span> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas&hellip;</p>

<p class="text1">You have now heard about Saturday, May 21, 2011 being Judgment Day.  Perhaps you have heard much Biblical evidence; and yet, still, you
do not believe God.  Do you require more and more proof?  The Ninevites did not
have the luxury of such an abundance of information that we have today.  They
only had one meager verse of Scripture to go on.  Today we are able to give
people quite a lot of information coming right out of the Bible.  <i>(For more

</i> However, mounds of information will never convince anyone.  Jesus pointed
this out when He said:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">John 8:47</span> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore
hear them not, because ye are not of God. </p>

<p class="text1">Please take note of the deadly seriousness in which the
Ninevites believed God and urgently acted upon it:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Jonah 3:6-8</span> For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose
from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth,
and sat in ashes&hellip;saying&hellip;let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way&hellip;</p>

<h4><span class="underline">DISCERNING TIME AND JUDGMENT</span></h4>

<p class="text1">As we have examined Biblical history, we have seen how the
Lord has repeatedly informed His people of approaching times of judgment before
the judgment actually occurred.  This is so consistent throughout Biblical
history that this certainly can be said to be a Biblical principle, as
Amos&nbsp;3:7 says, &ldquo;<b><i>The Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants.</i></b>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="text1">In the Bible, the Lord divides mankind into two groups.  He
refers to those He saves as &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and to those He does not save as &ldquo;fools.&rdquo; 
He also describes them as the &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; or the &ldquo;wicked.&rdquo;  The distinction
between the two has nothing to do with intelligence or human wisdom or human
merit of any kind.  Simply put, one is wise (and declared righteous) if God has
saved them and given them the Spirit of Christ.  Those who are not saved are as
fools or wicked because they do not possess Christ&rsquo;s Spirit (Wisdom).  If we
keep the Bible&rsquo;s definition of wisdom in mind, it will greatly help us in
understanding the following verses:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:9-10</span> &hellip;Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
and sealed till the time of the end...<span class="underline">none of the wicked shall understand;
but the wise shall understand</span>.</p>

<p class="text1">Most definitely, it was the Lord&rsquo;s intention to seal up His
Word (the Bible) until the time of the end.  But then notice, God points out
how &ldquo;<span class="underline">none</span> of the wicked&rdquo; will be able to understand.  Understand what? 
Well, He is referring to understanding the Word of God that will be unsealed at
the time of the end.  None of the unsaved of the world will understand these
things, just like the people of the world of Noah&rsquo;s day did not regard the
warning of the flood and just like Lot&rsquo;s sons-in-law dismissed the warning given
to them to flee the city.  Likewise today, none of the unsaved understand;
however, &ldquo;the <span class="underline">wise</span>&rdquo; will understand.  The &ldquo;wise&rdquo; understand only because
of God&rsquo;s great mercy.  The Lord expresses this truth once again in these
wonderful verses:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Ecclesiastes 8:5</span> &hellip;and a wise man's heart discerneth both time
and judgment.</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Proverbs 28:5</span> <span class="underline">Evil men understand not judgment</span>: but they that seek the LORD
understand all things.</p>

<p class="text1">Finally, whether or not we know that May 21 in 2011 is
Judgment Day rests on whether or not God has opened up our eyes to understand
these things.&nbsp; If He has, we will know that May 21, 2011 is <span class="underline">the Day of the Lord&rsquo;s Wrath</span>.  If He has not opened our eyes, then we will not know.  The Bible tells
us that the majority of people in the world are not chosen to salvation. This
is why Christ comes unexpectedly for billions of people.&nbsp; They do not
understand spiritual things.&nbsp; Since they do not have God&rsquo;s Spirit, they
are not going to take warning and they are not going to understand.&nbsp;
Sadly, they will surely perish: </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Ezekiel 33:4-5</span> Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet,
and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall
be upon his own head&hellip;But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.</p>

<p class="text1">God&rsquo;s people know (like the Ninevites) that these dates are
true and trustworthy only because this information comes right out of the Bible.&nbsp;
Many people are going to trust their churches or their pastors who will
assuredly say that they do not have to worry about a date.  But none of these
things are trustworthy.&nbsp; The truth is that the only trustworthy thing in
the world is the Bible.&nbsp; This is why as we get ever closer to this date of
May 21 in 2011, the big question for each person is, &ldquo;Do you trust the Bible or
do you trust something else?&rdquo; </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Proverbs 3:5</span> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean
not unto thine own understanding.</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Psalm 119:42</span> &hellip;for I trust in thy word.</p>
