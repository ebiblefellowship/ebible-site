<h4>Dear Beloved Friend,</h4>
<p class="text1">We are very pleased to send you this Bible, tract, or CD for your personal (and family) use.  Ebiblefellowship greatly desires that God might bless the words of His Book the Bible to your heart.  And bring salvation to you.</p>
<p class="text1">I am writing you this letter to inform you of the great urgency there now is in the world for each and every person.  In the book of Daniel God gave His prophet information concerning the end of the world and then told him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:4</span> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>
<p class="text1">And also again a little later in the same chapter:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:9</span> And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</p>

<p class="text1">It has become very obvious to the serious student of the Bible that we are now living at the time of the end of the world.  As a matter of fact, because we are currently at the end of time God is unsealing His Word the Bible and now revealing to us the following information:</p>
<p class="text1"><b>11,013 B.C.</b> --- God created the world.  Adam formed.</p>
<p class="text1"><b>May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1988 A.D.</b> From creation the 13,000<sup>th</sup> year of history  --- The Church Age ended in 1988.  God the Holy Spirit left all churches and congregations in the world.  And God now commands His (true) believers to come out of the churches:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Revelation 18:4</span> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>

<p class="text1"><b>1994 A.D.</b> --- Ended the first 2300 day period (Dan 8:14) wherein virtually no one in the world was being saved.  And beginning in September, 1994 God began to pour out His Holy Spirit a second time.  The latter rain (Joel 2:23,24) is another name that God gives to this period of time which goes from September, 1994 until the rapture of all the elect people of God in May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  During these glorious 17 years a great multitude will become saved outside of the churches from around the world.</p>
<p class="text1">In the book of Genesis God warns Noah of the approaching flood:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:4</span> For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="text1">The child of God today has learned from the Bible that the language of Genesis 7 has a twofold meaning.  Literally, there were seven days for Noah and his family and the animals to get into the ark; but spiritually, God was speaking to the world and declaring that sinful man has 7000 years to get into the safety of the salvation provided by the Lord Jesus Christ.  We know this because of what we read in: </p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Peter 3:8</span> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>

<p class="text1"><b>2011 A.D.</b> Since we know the flood took place in 4990 B.C. (please see <a href="http://www.familyradio.com/">FamilyRadio.com</a> for more information on the biblical timeline of history).  We can also project this date into the future and we find that the year 2011 A.D. is exactly 7000 years from the date of the flood (4990 + 2011 = 7001 minus 1 because there is no year zero = 7000 exactly). </p>
<p class="text1">God told Noah yet 7 days to get into the ark.  In the context of the flood in 2 Peter chapter 3 God also says that one day is as a 1000 years and a 1000 years as one day.  The time to find refuge in Christ is almost gone.  We are now less than 3 years away from  2011 A.D. </p>
<p class="text1">More than this, we know that the church age ended on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1988 A.D. And this began the period of “great tribulation” (see Matthew 24:21) in which Satan is loosed as the abomination of desolation to rule in all churches.  May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1988 is the time when the man of sin (Satan himself) takes his seat in the temple (churches).  We know that the length of the great tribulation will be 23 years.  It will go from May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1988 A.D. until May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 A.D. A full 23 years to the very day.  Exactly 8400 days (full of significance*). </p>

<p class="text1">May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 was derived from biblical data.  But it so happens that May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 in the Hebrew calendar is the 17th day of the 2nd month.  The very day in Noah’s calendar that the flood came:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened&hellip;16: And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</p>
<p class="text1">May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be the day God shuts the door on this world.  Keep in mind that the Bible says Jesus is the door:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 10:9</span> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>

<p class="text1">Christ is the only way to heaven.  There is none other name under heaven wherein we must be saved.  If God shuts the door (Christ) then there is no more salvation.  And actually, that is exactly what is going to happen.  On May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 the believers will be raptured and taken out of this world to meet the Lord in the air and forever be with the Lord.  All the rest of mankind (billions of people) will be left behind to experience a horrible period of 5 months of terrible misery on earth. </p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:24</span> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days <span class="norm">(5 months of 30 day months).</span></p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Revelation 9:5</span> And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>
<p class="text1">Following this 5 month period mankind and the whole world (and universe) will be destroyed by fervent heat on October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  All of unsaved mankind will cease to be after that final destruction. </p>

<p class="text1">There is much more to share.  But please, dearly beloved soul, be warned that the time for salvation is drawing to a close.  God has given the world 7000 years since the flood.  And now, 6,997 of those years are gone.  Less than 3 remain and before we know it time will run out of the hour glass and be gone forever.  </p>
<p class="text1">Our prayer at Ebiblefellowship is that you will receive this Bible (or tract, or CD) in the spirit it is offered.  And you will read it for all it’s worth.  As faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.  God saves through the reading and hearing of the Bible and no other way.  Read it to yourself.  Read it to your family.  Read it to your neighbors.  And in all your reading pray for mercy.  Pray the gracious and merciful God of the Bible will save you and deliver you from the wrath to come.  We read about God’s great compassion as He spared the people of Nineveh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Jonah 3:5-10</span> So the people of Nineveh believed God <span class="norm">(added note: that they would be destroyed in 40 days)</span>, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 6: For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 7: And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 8: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 9: Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? 10: And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.</p>
