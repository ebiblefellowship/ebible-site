<p class="text1"><a name="B0"></a>Many people find the Bible to be a difficult book
to read. They start out with good intentions but stop reading before long
because they just cannot understand what they are reading. This is very
unfortunate, because (1) the Bible is the very word of the infinite God who
created this universe and everything in it, revealing His will for how we are
to live our lives, and (2) God&rsquo;s Word is the saving power that He applies to
the lives of those that He has decided to save&mdash;no one can be saved apart from
the Word of God.</p>

<p class="text1">Mercifully, God does show us how we are to interpret the
Scriptures so that we might understand what He is saying to us. We will now
examine what God Himself tells us about how the Bible is to be understood.</p>

<p class="text2"><a name="B1"></a>The Bible alone, and in its entirety is the
revealed Word of God:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Timothy 3:16</span> All scripture is given by
inspiration of God, <span class="norm">[literally, &ldquo;is God-breathed&rdquo;]</span> and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Peter 1:21</span> For the prophecy came not in old time
by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost. </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span> For this cause also thank we God
without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of
us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of
God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Revelation 22:18 </span>For I testify unto every man that heareth
the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</p>




<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
Because the Bible is like no other book (it is not written by men but by
infinite God), we must look to God alone for the instructions of how to study
and understand the Bible. The Bible must be our only authority. We cannot use
the vain thoughts from our own sin-tainted minds to develop the rules for
interpreting Scripture.</p>


<p class="text2"><a name="B2"></a>Every word of Scripture, every character of the
original autographs, is perfect and true:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Proverbs 30:5</span> Every word of God is pure: He is a shield
unto them that put their trust in Him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Psalm 12:6</span> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver
tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Psalm 119:160 </span>Thy word is true from the beginning: and
every one of Thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Revelation 21:5 </span>&hellip;And He said unto me, Write: for these
words are true and faithful.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Matthew 5:18</span> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and
earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all
be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Romans 3:4</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every
man a liar;&hellip;</p>



<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
Because these words are perfect and true, there can be no error or
contradiction in the Bible. Thus, if we find passages that <i>seem</i> to
contradict each other, we can know that we are not understanding one of those
passages correctly. God often uses these <i>apparent</i> contradictions to
call our attention to an important teaching of Scripture, forcing us to study
more diligently.</p>



<p class="text2"><a name="B3"></a>The Bible is the power of God unto salvation:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Romans 1:16</span> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;
to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Romans 10:17</span> So then faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God.</p>




<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
There is no more important book in the universe. God will not save anyone
apart from the power of His Word. This is a matter of the greatest importance
to all mankind.</p>


<p class="text2"><a name="B4"></a>We can only understand the Bible if God the Holy
Spirit opens our (spiritual) eyes and our minds and hearts to give us
understanding of the infinite Words of God:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">1 Corinthians 2:14</span> But the natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither
can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Job 32:8</span> But there is a spirit in man: and the
inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Luke 24:45</span> Then opened He <span class="norm">[Christ]</span> their understanding,
that they might understand the scriptures,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Psalm 119:18</span> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold
wondrous things out of thy law.</p>


<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
We must study the Bible humbly and prayerfully, asking that God would open our
spiritual eyes and allow us to understand His Word.</p>


<p class="text2"><a name="B5"></a>The Bible explains that we are to compare
Scripture with Scripture (spiritual things with spiritual) to understand the
Bible:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">1 Corinthians 2:13</span> Which things also we speak, not in the
words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
<span class="underline">spiritual things with spiritual</span>.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 6:63b</span> &hellip;the words that I speak unto you, they are
spirit, and they are life.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Peter 1:20</span> Knowing this first, that no prophecy
of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</p>


<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
The Bible serves as its own &ldquo;Commentary&rdquo;, and its own &ldquo;Dictionary&rdquo;. The
meanings of words and phrases are not defined by man&rsquo;s wisdom, or studying of
secular Greek literature, but by God&mdash;we must look to see how God uses those
words elsewhere in Scripture.</p>



<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
Because the whole Bible is written by One Author, God, we can confidently
compare words and phrases from one part of the Bible with any other part of the
Bible. God tells us to compare Scripture with Scripture (spiritual with
spiritual). He does not tell us to compare historical with historical, or grammatical
with grammatical as many theologians teach today.</p>


<p class="text2"><a name="B6"></a>Even a child can understand the Bible, sufficient
to salvation, if God gives the understanding:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Timothy 3:15</span> And that from a child thou <span class="norm">[Timothy]</span> hast
known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class="text2"><a name="B7"></a>But another key fact (and somewhat surprising) is
that the Bible has been written to be difficult for unbelievers to understand&mdash;this
is consistent with Jesus&rsquo; own method of teaching while He walked and taught on
Earth: </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Proverbs 25:2</span> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing:
but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Psalm 78:2-3</span> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will
utter dark sayings of old: Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have
told us.</p>

<p class="text1">(This &ldquo;parable&rdquo; above is the entire history of the nation of Israel,
which is a historical picture or type of the Gospel.)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">2 Peter 3:16</span> As also in all his <span class="norm">[Paul&rsquo;s]</span> epistles,
speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be
understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also
the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>

<p class="text2">More examples&mdash;Jesus spoke almost entirely in parables to the
general public: </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Mark 4:33-34</span> And with many such parables spake
he <span class="norm">[Jesus]</span> the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But without a
parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all
things to his disciples.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Luke 8:10</span> And he <span class="norm">[Jesus]</span> said, Unto you it is
given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables;
that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>


<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
The Bible contains many verses that have a deeper spiritual meaning, written as
parables and allegories.</p>


<p class="text2"><a name="B8"></a>The Bible testifies of itself that it is filled
from beginning to end with the message of Jesus, the Gospel of Salvation, and
that many Old Testament stories are actually historical parables which
symbolically point us to Christ:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Acts 3:18</span> But those things, which God before had showed
by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
fulfilled.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Acts 3:24</span> Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those
that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
days.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 5:39</span> Search the scriptures; for in them ye
think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Hebrews 10:7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of
the book it is written of me,) to do Thy will, O God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Luke 24:25-27</span> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow
of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to
have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at
Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in <span class="underline">all</span> the scriptures
the things concerning himself.</p>


<p class="Box"><b>&diams; </b>
As we study the Bible, we should be looking for the Gospel of Christ everywhere
that we read. As we begin to see Christ, we can know that we are coming to the
true meaning of a verse.</p>


<p class="text2">The entire Bible contains a deeper Spiritual meaning hidden as
parables and allegories within verses that appear to be simple historical or
moral statements. Every historical and moral statement of the Bible is still
absolutely true, but we can learn even more by looking at the symbolic
Spiritual message of these verses. Jesus had to rebuke His followers, and
Pharisees alike for trying to take His words literally when He meant them
symbolically (with a deeper spiritual meaning). Just a few examples:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Matthew 16:6-8</span> Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and
beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. And they reasoned
among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. Which when
Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among
yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 4:11,13</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast
nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that
living water? Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again:</p>

<p class="text1">(she mistook literal water for spiritual, living water).</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 3:4</span> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born
when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb, and be
born?</p>

<p class="text1">(And in verse 10, Jesus&rsquo; rebuke): </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 3:10</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a
master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 11:11-13</span> These things said he: and after that he saith
unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
sleep. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. Howbeit
Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest
in sleep.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 6:51-53, 60-61,66</span> I am the living bread which came
down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the
bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
world. The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye
have no life in you.&hellip; Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard
this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? When Jesus knew in
himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend
you?&hellip; From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with
him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Luke 24:45-46</span> Then opened he their understanding, that
they might understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written,
and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>

<p class="text1">Jesus here says that the Old Testament Scriptures wrote that
Christ had to be killed and resurrected the third day. However, that is not
explicitly written anywhere in the Old Testament&mdash;this is only stated
allegorically as in<i> </i><b>Jonah 1:17</b><i>:</i></p>

<p class="verse">&ldquo;Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And
Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="text1">Christ points to this Old Testament verse showing that it is
allegorically describing His resurrection in <b>Matthew 12:40</b><i>. </i>Thus,
Christ shows us that to correctly understand the story of Jonah, we <span class="underline">must</span>
see what it is telling us about the resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Luke 17:12,14-17</span> And as he entered into a certain
village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: And when
he saw them, he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it
came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he
saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, And
fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And
Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</p>

<p class="text1">In this account we see one of the clearest indications of how we
must understand the spiritual aspect of the Scriptures. Here, Christ commands
the ten lepers to show themselves to the priest as the Old Testament law
commanded. This was a reference to ceremonial laws in <b>Leviticus 14:2</b>
which says: </p>

<p class="verse">&ldquo;This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing:
He shall be brought unto the priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="text1">Christ shows us in His response to the one leper that this
command was actually to be understood <i>spiritually</i>, and that it pointed
to our coming to <i>the Great High Priest</i> (<b>Hebrews 4:14</b>) when we
become saved. Jesus rebuked the other nine lepers for following the literal
command of God while ignoring the <i>true</i> <i>spiritual </i>intent of His
command to go show themselves to Christ the High Priest and to give thanks.</p>

<p class="text2"><a name="B9"></a>The Bible is a <span class="underline">Spiritual</span> book and is not
to be read just as a book of moral teachings, or history, or poetry, or
wisdom. The focus is on mankind&rsquo;s greatest need&mdash;Salvation.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">John 6:63</span> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="vref">Romans 7:14</span> For we know that the law is spiritual:
but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>

<p class="text2"><a name="B10"></a>So we can summarize the key teachings of God
regarding how we are to study and understand the Bible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p class="text1">Always
pray before studying the Bible, since it is only God the Holy Spirit who can
open our eyes and give us any understanding of His infinite Word.</p></li>

<li><p class="text1">Know
that every statement in Scripture is written by God and is completely true;
therefore, it will be in harmony with every other statement. If there is an
apparent contradiction, we do not yet understand one of the statements
correctly. </p></li>

<li><p class="text1">We
are to compare Scripture with Scripture. The Bible is its own dictionary and
defines its own terms. This means that as we read the Bible, we should make a
note when we see a verse or idea that seems related to other verses we have
read. Studying these verses together can help us to understand them better,
since each one may contain different clues to the overall meaning. Another
implication is that we do not look to Greek or Hebrew dictionaries to find the
meaning of a Biblical word; we must instead see how that Greek or Hebrew word
is used by God elsewhere in the Bible. There are excellent tools to help with
this task&mdash;such as <span class="underline">Strong&rsquo;s Exhaustive</span> <span class="underline">Concordance</span> or <span class="underline">Young&rsquo;s
Analytical Concordance</span>, and Personal Computer Bible search software which
can be obtained on the <b>free EBF1 CD</b> from our website at: <a
href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/free_cd">www.ebiblefellowship.com/free_cd</a>.
Many other free Bible languages can be downloaded from the Help menu of this
software. These tools can help us find all of the verses where a particular
Greek or Hebrew word is used, without requiring us to learn the original languages.
</p></li>

<li><p class="text1">The
entire Bible, Old Testament and New Testament, is laced through with God&rsquo;s
gospel of salvation, pointing to the sinner&rsquo;s need for salvation from the
coming judgment, Christ&rsquo;s atoning sacrifice on the Cross, the fact that this
salvation is totally God&rsquo;s sovereign work, or a related spiritual truth. Any
symbolic or allegorical meaning must ultimately point to Christ and His Gospel,
and must be consistent with everything else in Scripture.</p></li>

<li><p class="text1">Parables
and allegories must not be pressed too far&hellip; being symbols and shadows of the
truth that they point us to, they sometimes are not applicable to every aspect
of the underlying truth. This means that they teach some aspects of the
substance they point to, but may be incomplete or imply some other aspect that
cannot be applied. This is where the principle in item #2 must be
applied&mdash;making sure that the conclusions reached are consistent with everything
else in Scripture on that subject.</p></li>

<li><p class="text1">There
will still be areas of Scripture that are not yet opened to us. We must be
humble enough to admit that we will always &ldquo;know in part&rdquo;, and &ldquo;see through a
glass darkly&rdquo; in this life (<b>1 Corinthians 13:12</b>).</p></li>
