<hr />

<p class="text1">The purpose of this tract is to inform you of the great
urgency there now is in the world for each and every person to be reconciled to
God.  The Bible is the Word of God!  Everything the Bible declares has the full
authority of God Himself.  Now, at this time, information is coming forth
from the Bible which clearly reveals God&rsquo;s plan for Judgment Day and the end of the
world itself.  The Bible has opened up its secrets concerning the timeline of
history.  This information was never previously known because God had closed up
His Word blocking any attempt to gain knowledge of the end of the world.  We
read about this in the book of Daniel:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:9</span> And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for
the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. </p>


<p class="text1">However, now in our present day, God has opened up His Word
(the Bible) to reveal a great deal of truth concerning the end of time (and
many other teachings).  Also, in the same chapter of Daniel, it says:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Daniel 12:4</span> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the
words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and
fro, and knowledge shall be increased. </p>



<p class="text1">God is now opening up His Word because we have arrived at
the time of the end.  For this reason, it has become very obvious to the serious
student of the Bible that we are now living in the last few days of earth&rsquo;s
history.  As a matter of fact, because we are living at the end of time, God is
now revealing to His people the following information:</p>

<h4>THE BIBLE&rsquo;S CALENDAR OF HISTORY</h4>

<p class="text1">The Lord has opened up His people&rsquo;s understanding to the
&ldquo;Biblical calendar&rdquo; found on the pages of the Bible.  The genealogies of the book
of Genesis, primarily in chapters 5 and 11, can be shown to be a precise
calendar of the history of mankind in this world.  The Bible&rsquo;s calendar of
history is completely accurate and trustworthy.  </p>

<p class="text1">Since this Bible calendar is given by God in His Word, it
can be trusted wholeheartedly. In this brief pamphlet, we will share some of
the conclusions derived from the Biblical calendar and from other studies in the
Scriptures.  However, <span class="underline">the amount of information available is far too
abundant and complex</span> to get into much detail in this short pamphlet; but we
can and will give precise and compelling dates.  These dates can be trusted
entirely because they come right out of the Bible. (EBiblefellowship has no affiliation with Family Radio; however, we highly recommend that you obtain a <span class="underline">free</span> copy of the book &ldquo;We Are Almost There!&rdquo; by writing to the following address: Family Stations, Inc.,  290 Hegenberger Rd., Oakland, CA 94621. This book goes into far greater detail regarding the  timing of Judgment Day and the end of the world. Also, you can read or download &ldquo;We Are Almost There!&rdquo; online at:

<h4>TIMING OF IMPORTANT EVENTS IN HISTORY </h4>

<p class="text1"><b>11,013 BC</b>&mdash;Creation.  God created the world and man
(Adam and Eve).</p>

<p class="text1"><b>4990 BC</b>&mdash;The flood of Noah&rsquo;s day.  All perished in a worldwide flood.  Only Noah, his wife, and his 3
sons and their wives survived in the ark (6023 years from creation).</p>

<p class="text1"><b>7 BC</b>&mdash;The year Jesus Christ was born (11,006 years
from creation).  </p>

<p class="text1"><b>33 AD</b>&mdash;The year Jesus Christ was crucified and the
church age began (11,045 years from creation; 5023 calendar years from the flood). </p>

<p class="text1"><b>1988 AD</b>&mdash;This year ended the church age and began the great tribulation period of 23 years (13,000 years from creation).</p>

<p class="text1"><b>1994 AD</b>&mdash;On September 7<sup>th</sup>, the first 2300-day period of the great
tribulation came to an end and the latter rain began, commencing God&rsquo;s plan to
save a great multitude of people outside of the churches (13,006 years from creation). </p>

<p class="text1"><b>2011 AD</b>&mdash;On May 21<sup>st</sup>, Judgment Day will begin and the rapture (the taking up into heaven of God’s elect people) will occur at
the end of the 23-year great tribulation.  On October 21<sup>st</sup>, the world
will be destroyed by fire (7000 years from the flood; 13,023 years from creation).</p>

<h4>ONE DAY IS AS 1000 YEARS</h4>

<p class="text1">The child of God has learned from the Bible that the
language of Genesis 7 has a twofold meaning:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:4</span> For <span class="underline">yet seven days</span>, and I will
cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living
substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.  </p>

<p class="text1">Historically, as God spoke these words, there were seven
days remaining for Noah, his family, and the animals to get into the
safety of the ark; but spiritually (and the Bible is a spiritual book), God was
speaking to all of the people of the world and was declaring that sinful mankind
would have 7000 years to find refuge in the salvation provided by Jesus
Christ.  How can we know that?  We know this is so based on what we read in 2
Peter, chapter 3:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">2 Peter 3:6-8</span> Whereby the world that then was,
being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are
now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that <span class="underline">one day is with the
Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day</span>.  </p>

<p class="text1">The context of 2 Peter 3 is extremely important!  In the
first few verses, God refers us to the destruction of the world by the flood
during Noah&rsquo;s day.  Then we find an interesting admonition that we ought not to be
&ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; of one thing,  which is, 1 day is as
1000 years, and 1000 years is as 1 day.  Immediately following this bit of
information is a very vivid description of the end of the present world by
fire.  </p>

<p class="text1">What could God be telling us by identifying 1 day along
with 1000 years? </p>

<p class="text1">Since we recently have discovered the Biblical calendar of
history on the pages of the Bible, we find that the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day occurred
in the year 4990 BC.  This date is completely accurate (for further information on the Biblical timeline of history, please go to:
<a href="http://www.familyradio.com/">www.familyradio.com</a>).  It was in
the year 4990 BC that God revealed to Noah that there would be yet 7 days until the
flood of waters would be upon the earth.  Now, if we substitute 1000 years for
each one of those 7 days, we get 7000 years.  And when we project 7000
years into the future from 4990 BC, we find that it falls on the year 2011 AD.  </p>

<p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4990 + 2011 = 7001    </b></p>

<p class="text1">Note: When counting from an Old Testament date to a New Testament date, always
 subtract one year because there is no year zero, resulting in:</p>

<p class="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4990 + 2011 – 1
= 7000 years exactly.</b></p>

<p class="text1">The year 2011 AD will be the 7000<sup>th</sup> year from
the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day.  It will be the end of the length of time given to
mankind to find grace in God&rsquo;s sight.  This means that the time to find refuge
in Christ has grown extremely short. We are only a little ways off from the
year 2011 AD!  </p>

<p class="text1">It is not unusual that God&rsquo;s people have been given
insight into the timing of the end of the world. Actually, the Bible tells us
this is normally the case.  In times past, God has warned His people of
approaching periods of judgment:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Amos 3:7</span> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing,
but he <span class="underline">revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</span>. </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Hebrews 11:7</span> By faith Noah, being warned of God of
things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his
house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is by faith.  </p>

<h4>JUDGMENT DAY: MAY 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011</h4>

<p class="text1">We know that the year 2011 is the 7000<sup>th</sup> year
from the flood. We also know that God will destroy this world in that year. 
But when in 2011 will this occur?</p>

<p class="text1">The answer is amazing.  Let&rsquo;s take another look at the
flood account in the book of Genesis:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:11</span> In the six hundredth year of Noah's
life, <span class="underline">in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month</span>, the same
day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
heaven were opened.  </p>

<p class="text1">Faithful to His Word, God did bring the flood 7 days later
in the 600<sup>th</sup> year, on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month of the calendar aligned with Noah&rsquo;s lifespan.  It was on this 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month that God shut the door on the ark,  securing
the safety of its occupants and also sealing the fate of everyone else in the
world outside of the ark.  They would all now certainly perish in that
worldwide catastrophe.  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:16,17</span> And they that went in, went in male
and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the <span class="underline">LORD shut him in</span>.
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare
up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.  </p>

<p class="text1">Earlier it was mentioned that the church age came to an
end in the year 1988 AD.  It so happens that the church age began on the day of Pentecost (May 22<sup>nd</sup>) in the year 33 AD.  Then 1955 years later, the church age came to its conclusion on May 21<sup>st</sup>, which was the day before Pentecost in 1988.  </p>

<p class="text1">The Bible teaches that the end of the church age would
occur simultaneously with the beginning of the great tribulation:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Matthew 24:21</span> For then shall be great tribulation,
such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever
shall be.  </p>

<p class="text1">On May 21<sup>st</sup>, 1988, God finished using the churches and
congregations of the world.  The Spirit of God left all churches and Satan, the
man of sin, entered into the churches to rule at that point in time.  The Bible
teaches us that this awful period of judgment upon the churches would last for
23 years.  A full 23 years (8400 days exactly) would be from May 21<sup> st</sup>, 1988 until May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  This information was
discovered in the Bible completely apart from the information regarding the
7000 years from the flood.  </p>

<p class="text1">Therefore, we see that the full 23-year tribulation period
concludes on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  This date is the exact day that the great
tribulation comes to its end, and this is also the most likely landing spot for the
7000 years from the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day.  </p>

<p class="text1">Keep in mind that God shut the door on the ark on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of Noah&rsquo;s calendar.  We also find that May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 is the end of the great tribulation period.  There is a strong
relationship between the 2<sup>nd</sup> month and 17<sup>th</sup> day of Noah&rsquo;s
calendar and May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 of our Gregorian calendar.  This
relationship cannot be readily seen until we discover that there is another
calendar to consider, which is the Hebrew (or Biblical) calendar.  May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 happens to be the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

month of the Hebrew calendar.  By this, God is confirming to us that we have a very
correct understanding regarding the 7000-year timeline from the flood.  May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 is the equivalent date to the date when God shut the door on Noah&rsquo;s
ark. Through this and much other Biblical information, we find that May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 will be the day when God takes up into heaven His elect people.
 May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be Judgment Day! This is the day God shuts the door of salvation on
the world.  </p>

<p class="text1">In other words, in having the great tribulation period
conclude on a day that identifies with the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

month of Noah&rsquo;s calendar, God is without question confirming to us that this is 
the day He intends to shut forever the door of entry into heaven:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">John 10:9</span> 
<span class="underline">I am the door</span>: by me if any
man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.  </p>

<p class="text1">The Bible is very clear that Christ is the only way into
heaven.  He is the only portal into the glorious kingdom of heaven.  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Acts 4:12</span> Neither is there salvation in any
other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
must be saved.  </p>

<p class="text1">Once the door (Jesus) is shut on Judgment Day, there is no more salvation
possible on earth:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Revelation 3:7</span> &hellip;These things saith he that is holy,
he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man
shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;  </p>

<p class="text1">The Bible teaches that on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, only  true believers elected by God to receive salvation will be raptured 
(taken up) out of this world to meet the Lord in the air and forever be with the
Lord:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">1 Thessalonians 4:16,17</span> For the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are alive and
remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  </p>

<p class="text1">All the rest of mankind (billions of people) will be left behind to experience the awful judgment of God, a horrible period of 5 months of torment upon earth:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Revelation 9:3-5</span> And there came out of the smoke
locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the
earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men
which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given
that they should not kill them, but that they should be <span class="underline">tormented five
months</span>: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh
a man.  </p>

<h4>THE END OF THE WORLD: OCTOBER 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011</h4>

<p class="text1">By God&rsquo;s grace and tremendous mercy, He is giving us
advanced warning as to what He is about to do.  On Judgment Day, May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, this 5-month period of horrible torment will begin for all the inhabitants of the earth.  It will be on May 21<sup>st</sup> that God will raise up all the dead
that have ever died from their graves.  Earthquakes will ravage the whole world
as the earth will no longer conceal its dead (Isaiah 26:21). People who died as saved individuals will experience the resurrection of their bodies and immediately leave this world to forever be with the Lord.  Those who died unsaved will be raised up as well, but only to have their lifeless bodies scattered about the face of all the earth.  Death will be everywhere. </p>

<p class="text1">The Lord also emphasizes these awful 5 months of destruction
in the final verse of Genesis, chapter 7:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Genesis 7:24</span> And the waters prevailed upon the
earth an hundred and fifty days.  </p>

<p class="text1">Five months after May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  It so happens that October 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011 is also the
last day of the Biblical Feast of Tabernacles (held simultaneously with the
Feast of Ingathering). Tabernacles is held in the 7<sup>th</sup> month of the
Hebrew calendar.  The way God speaks of this feast in the Bible is very
significant:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Exodus 23:16</span> &hellip;the feast of ingathering, which is
in the <span class="underline">end of the year</span>, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of
the field.  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Exodus 34:22</span> And thou shalt observe the feast of
weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering <span class="underline">at
the year's end</span>.  </p>

<p class="text1">The Feast of Tabernacles / Ingathering was said to be in
the &ldquo;end of the year&rdquo; even though it was observed in the Hebrew 7<sup>th</sup>

month, which is not the end of the year.  The reason for this is that the
spiritual fulfillment of this particular feast is the end of the world.  The date October 21<sup>st</sup>, 
2011 will be the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles and the
last day of earth&rsquo;s existence.  The Bible describes what will take place on October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 in the following passage:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">2 Peter 3:10</span> But the day of the Lord will come as
a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
works that are therein shall be burned up.  </p>

<p class="text1">Along with the entire world and universe, all those who
have sinned against God and were left behind will likewise be consumed by this
fire and be eternally destroyed:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">2 Thessalonians 1:8,9</span> In flaming fire taking vengeance on
them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his power;  </p>

<p class="text1">On October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, God will completely destroy this creation and all of the people who never experienced the salvation of Jesus Christ along with it. The awful payment for their sinful rebellion against God will be completed by the loss of everlasting life.  On October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, all of these poor people will cease to exist from that point forward. How sad that noble man, made in God&rsquo;s image, will die like a beast and perish forever: </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Psalm 49:12</span> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. </p>

<p class="text1">There is much more to share.  But please, dear soul, be warned that the time for salvation is drawing to a rapid close!  God
has given the world 7000 years from the flood, and now only a few days remain
until we reach May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  Before we know it, time will have run
completely out.  The few grains of sand remaining in our hourglass will have
elapsed and be gone forever.  Although little time remains, there is
still wonderful hope for anyone today:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">2 Corinthians 6:2</span> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a
time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now
is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)  </p>

<p class="text1">It does not take God much time at all to save someone.  In
the last hours of a terribly sinful life, the thief on the cross was saved by
Christ:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Luke 23:42,43</span> And he said unto Jesus, Lord,
remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.  And Jesus said unto him, Verily
I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.  </p>

<p class="text1">Our prayer is that you will receive this tract in the
spirit of genuine concern in which it is being offered.  As you read this
pamphlet, please carefully consider the verses quoted from the Bible, for they
are the Word of God, and as such, possess absolute power and authority.  Our only
hope for salvation is through the reading of the Word of God.  It is now that
the door of heaven (Christ) is open.  It is now that God is saving a great
multitude of people from around the world outside of the churches and
congregations:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Revelation 7:9,13,14</span> After this I beheld, and, lo, <span class="underline">a
great multitude</span>, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their hands; &hellip;What are these which are arrayed
in white robes? and whence came they?  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.
And he said to me, <span class="underline">These are they which came out of great tribulation</span>,
and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.  </p>

<p class="text1">God saves through the hearing of the Word of God and no
other way:  </p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Romans 10:17</span> So then faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God.  </p>

<p class="text1">Read the Bible with all your family (especially your
children); and along with your reading, pray for mercy.  Pray to the merciful and
gracious God of the Bible that He might deliver you from the approaching
destruction.  We learn a little about God&rsquo;s tremendous compassion in the book
of Jonah.  God also gave advance warning to the people of Nineveh regarding the
destruction of their city:</p>

<p class="verseb"><span class="vref">Jonah 3:4-9</span> And Jonah began to enter into the
city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, <span class="underline">Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall
be overthrown</span>. So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For
word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid
his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he
caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the
king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste
any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But let man and beast be covered
with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from
his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God
will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
  </p>

<p class="text1">God did not destroy the people of Nineveh. Although there
is no possibility that God will not follow through on His intention to destroy
the world in 2011, we can know from His dealings with the people of Nineveh that
God is tenderhearted and full of mercy.  This should encourage each one of us
to go to God and beseech Him for His great mercy.  </p>
