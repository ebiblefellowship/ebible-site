        <p class="orange-gradient">Isaiah 62:6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: 
          ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence.</p>
           
        <p>By God's mercy, EBible has obtained five recreational vehicles (RVs) that will be used on the East Coast of the USA to spread the news 
          of Judgment Day.</p>

        <img src="<%= images_url %>/caravan_03.jpg" alt="Parked RV caravan"></p>
          
        <p>We would like to use the RVs as much as possible up until May 21st.  If you are interested in participating 
          (either by driving or joining with an RV tract distribution event), no long term commitment will be necessary. You can sign up for 
          one weekend, or, a week long trip. Lord willing, we hope to use the RV caravan each weekend that is left; and also, to take a 1 week 
          long caravan trip in each of the four remaining months (Feb/Mar/Apr/May).</p>

        <p>We require that the application form below be filled out before anyone is accepted as a driver/passenger in the caravan.  Also, any 
          and all drivers of the RVs must fill out the "Request For Release of Driving Record" form in order for an insurance company to do a 
          background check.  No one can drive without filling out this form.</p>

        <p>If you have desired to travel and get the word out about the coming Day of Judgment, but family commitment 
          has kept you back, please consider signing up and traveling with your family for one weekend, or, take 1 week's vacation and sign up for 
          our 1 week's caravan tract trip (dates and destinations to be determined).</p>  
          
        <p>Committing to E Bible's Project Caravan does not require one to leave their job. You can continue to work and support your family or 
          pay your bills, and also, for a short period of time, serve the Lord in Project Caravan.</p>
        
        <p>May God bless His Word and the efforts put forth by many in the few short days we have remaining.</p>
