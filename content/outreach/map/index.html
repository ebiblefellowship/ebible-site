          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="disclaimer">This map is only displaying many of the outreach activities that we are aware of.  It is in no way implying that we know all of what God is doing to get this message out to the whole world.  This map also does not take into account much of Family Radio's broadcast to the world through many radio stations, shortwave, and internet.  Also, tract distribution by God's people all over the world cannot be accounted for either. So the outlook is much better than it appears on this map.</p>
