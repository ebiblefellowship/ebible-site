        <p class="orange-gradient">Ephesians 6:19-20 ...that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
           For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
           
        <p>EBible's <em>Project Jonah</em> has been designed as a final, all-encompassing effort to reach nations overseas with the news of Judgment Day
          through the distribution of gospel tracts. In conjunction with Family Radio's <em>Project Jonah</em>, EBible hopes to reach many 
          lost souls with this dreadful and most awesome declaration of judgment and wonderful hope for salvation.</p>
          
        <p>Because it is very hard work to pass-out tracts 'humbly' day after day, we must be certain that only qualified individuals become a 
          part of this mission trip.  We have prepared an application form for those sincerely interested in laboring in this effort.</p>
