  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">05:09</span> Have you looked at the math equation of May 14, 1948 to March 9, 2012?  This is 23,310 days and it breaks down into 2x3x3x5x7x37 or 5x7x666.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">07:00</span> I would like to look at Song of Solomon 4:12-16 and 6:2.  Can these verses be tied in with Esther 7:7-8?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">17:56</span> Could we look at Matthew 26:40 and Mark 14:37?  God says in the latter half of Matthew 26:40, &ldquo;What, could ye not watch with me one hour?&rdquo;  But God says in the latter half of Mark 14:37, &ldquo;Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?&rdquo;  One seems to be plural and the other seems to be singular.  Also, in both of these verses, God uses the phrase &ldquo;watch one hour.&rdquo;  Could you explain this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:07</span> Have you gone back through the timeline again to see whether or not everything added up and that May 21st was the Day of Judgment?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:38</span> Could you look at Judges 5:24-27?  There are many interesting events that take place surrounding the death of Sisera.  There is also a very curious statement in Judges 5:27 in regards to his fall.  Could some of this language relate to the information we have about Satan losing his authority on May 21?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:31</span> Could you please give me some insight on Deuteronomy 33:2 when it mentions &ldquo;ten thousands of saints&rdquo;?  Historically or spiritually, what is this talking about?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">44:14</span> In Revelation 18:8,10,17 and 19, we see God using the parabolic phrases of &ldquo;one day&rdquo; one time and &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; three times.  Does the phrase &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; point to judgment being completed?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">49:37</span> In Ezekiel 37:22, what are the two nations that are divided and made into?  </li>
  </ol>
