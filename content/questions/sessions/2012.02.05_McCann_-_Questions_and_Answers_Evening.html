  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">03:03</span> Could you look at Deuteronomy 21:17 and Revelation 1:5?  In relation to the doubling of judgment on the unsaved, will the double portion have any reflection on the 200 million in Revelation 9 causing that number to double and/or how did God circumvent the law in Deuteronomy 21:17 when it came to the blessings that Jacob and Ephraim had received?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">08:38</span> It says in Esther 1:8 that the drinking was &ldquo;according to the law.&rdquo;  What does this mean?  I thought that we were not supposed to drink wine.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">18:55</span> There seems to be a contradiction between Esther 2:12 and 2:16 in relation to the 12 months and the 10 months.  The maids were to go into the king after a 12-month purification process, but Esther was taken in at the tenth month.  Can you explain this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:00</span> Can you explain why you are not figuring in the Biblical calendar of 30-day months for the five-month period between May 21 and October  21 and instead are saying that it was a period of 147 days?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:15</span> (Continued from previous question):  Just so I&rsquo;m clear on this, is each Hebrew year not a year of 30-day months?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">33:44</span> Will we begin to see a manifestation of the salvation of the elect that took place prior to May 21 of 2011 in great multitudes in the next 30 days?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:00</span> With all of the symbolism in the book of Esther, can you talk about the symbolism of the feasts?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">39:45</span> We are all looking forward to the feast of Purim; however, recently someone said that this feast had an element of Satan in it.  The thinking was that this was because Haman, who represents Satan, is the one who threw the lot in order to find out what day he would destroy the Jews.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">44:37</span> Does 1 Kings 8:65-66 relate to Esther 9:17-19?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">47:45</span> In Esther 8:9, what does the third month and the 23rd day of the month mean?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">53:17</span> In Leviticus 23 and Numbers 29, God talks about the month Tishri and there are three things that take place during that month.  The first day is the blowing of trumpets.  Then the 10th day is the Day of Atonement.  That is two days.  If you add these two days to the 7 days and the 7 days, which is 14 days, and then the 8th day is when they are sent away, which gets us to 15 days, this equals 17 days total.  Does this relate to the 17-year latter rain, the last part of the great tribulation?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">57:43</span> (Continued from previous question):  In 1 Kings 8:64, do you know the meaning of the brazen altar being too small and them sacrificing in the middle court?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">59:46</span> In Genesis 8:6 when Noah opened the window of the ark after 40 days, this 40 days, if I am correct, is when the rain stopped and it is 40 days after the 2nd month and the 17th day of the month after he entered in.  Can you speak on this?  </li>
  </ol>
