<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>The spreadsheet that you
mentioned before, is there an email address where you can send this out?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I was just given a good suggestion
that we put this up on the website.  I will send this to Bill Burton and maybe
he can put this up.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>I do not know if you have
heard some of the studies regarding the Friday night study, but maybe you can
touch on this.  One of the things that is being taught there &ndash; and some people
are accepting this while I do not &ndash; is that Satan knows the date but Christ
does not.  Can you say something about this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>As far as Satan, I think that this is
based on the statement that is made by the demons, &ldquo;Art thou come hither to
torment us before the time?&rdquo;  This seems to indicate that they have some idea
of the time.  </p>

<p>The date is in God&rsquo;s complete control.  We see in the book
of Esther that this was chosen by lot, and the Bible tells us that God is the
One who determines the lot.  The Bible tells us that He knows the end from the
beginning, and there is just no way around this.  </p>

<p>This is being said at the Friday night studies and this is
also being said in the churches, &ldquo;Well, Christ is God but He does not know this
one thing&rdquo;; but this is not what the Bible teaches.  </p>

<p>The moment that anyone says that Christ does not know the
least thing, they are then making Him less than God.  Job says in Job 24, &ldquo;Times
are not hidden from the Almighty.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>To say that Christ knows everything but that He does not
know the particular date for the end of the world, how then does He know
eternity future beyond this?  There will be a big change in eternity future
when this world ends.  If He does not know the date for the end of the world,
then He does not know exactly the moment when all of His sheep will join Him in
Heaven and be with Him forevermore in the new Heaven and new earth.  This means
that He lacks an awful lot of knowledge about eternity future.  </p>

<p>In other words, by simple deduction, if you are God and you
do not know the date of the end of the world but you do know that this world is
not going to be here on one date because at the next point all of the elect
will be with you in Heaven, then you could figure out that that must be the
date for the end of the world.  </p>

<p>This just makes no sense and this is something that is not
new.  This is not a new revelation.  We have heard this for several years from
the churches.  </p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #2</i>): 
</b>Can you explain why Satan would not know the date?  I am hoping that
someone is listening and maybe they can hear this.    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I do not know all that Satan knows or does
not know.  I know that he understands &ldquo;dark sayings.&rdquo;  The Bible tells us
this.  Satan has a lot of Bible knowledge.  </p>

<p>As far as whether or not he specifically knows the date of
the end, I do not know if the Bible gets into this.  We know that he knows that
Judgment Day was May 21 because there was a big change in the program for him. 
He was put down and he was deposed as the ruler of the churches and of the
world and Christ was exalted; and so Satan is fully aware of this.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  What about the verse that says,
&ldquo;But of that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which
are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father&rdquo;?  I believe that &ldquo;the Son&rdquo;
there is actually Satan.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I have not looked at this recently, but that
is the last understanding that I had the last time that I looked at this.  </p>

<p>People are trying to figure out, &ldquo;What happened?  Maybe we
cannot know.&rdquo;  I said this many times leading up to May 21 and this still
stands.  Nothing has changed in this sense.  God has a lot of information in
the Bible that indicates that His people will know the timing of the end.  This
has not changed.  </p>

<p>Also, if you just look at this from a practical standpoint
or from a worldly perspective, there have been many inventions in this world. 
For example with flight, there are those who attempted to take flight and they
failed and failed and failed.  </p>

<p>At that point, if you were back there in history before the
Wright brothers or before those other earlier pioneers of flight, you would
have had a decision to make, &ldquo;Since no one has ever flown before and because I
have just witnessed someone crash into the bottom of the valley and what was
left was nothing but a wreck, am I going to think that it is an impossibility
that anyone can ever fly?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Many people went this way, but some realized that there was
a little progress that was being made, &ldquo;They had more time in the air at this
point before they crashed.&rdquo;  But whatever, some people were going to think, &ldquo;I
still think that it is possible.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>For those who based their decision on what they could
presently see with their eyes and on past history, they concluded that man
could not fly; and the reality is that they were dead wrong.  This is how it
has been with many, many things in the world, and this is how it is now with
understanding the end.  </p>

<p>People who are just concluding this based on certain things
not occurring as we thought and believe that it is now impossible to know, this
information did not change prior to what happened.  It is just really the
circumstances that we have now and what they are seeing with their eyes that
are making them come to this conclusion.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>You mentioned billboards. 
The second letter that was sent out in the book of Esther, did that just go to
the Jews and not to the entire province?  Would that letter have concerned
anyone else apart from the Jews?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is a good question.  Let us look
at Esther 8:17, which is the last verse of Esther 8:    </p>

<p class="verse">And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast
and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of
the Jews fell upon them.  </p>

<p>It goes on to emphasize this two more times in chapter
nine.  This means that, necessarily, everyone had to hear.  A decree like that
could not have been put up without everyone hearing.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Do you think that there is
a tie-in between the first month in casting the lot and God first introducing
the feast of unleavened bread in Exodus 12?  Also, the lamb was kept from the
10<sup>th</sup> day until the 14<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; I do not.  Again, it was the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month that the decree was made.  It was probably on
the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month of Ahasuerus&rsquo; 12<sup>th</sup>
year that the lot was cast.  Then 338 days after that would be 12/13, which
works out to be 2x13x13.  Also, the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month when Haman was killed would be 46 days after the first casting of the
lot, and that would break down to 2x23.  But this does not relate to Passover. 
  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can you explain Romans
7:9?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Romans 7:9:    </p>

<p class="verse">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
came, sin revived, and I died.  </p>

<p>I can tell you what I have heard Mr. Camping teach on this
verse.  I have never personally checked this out, but I tend to agree with Mr.
Camping that this verse is speaking of mankind.  We were &ldquo;alive without the law
once&rdquo; before God gave the Law to Adam and Eve and they broke the Law; then sin
entered in and they died, as it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  </p>

<p>If you are looking at the word &ldquo;revived,&rdquo; I cannot help you
with that.  I am sorry.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Since the title of &ldquo;the son
of perdition&rdquo; was given to Judas and Judas was not one of the elect, could this
mean that the title of &ldquo;the son of perdition&rdquo; could relate to any who are not
of the elect?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>In relation to Mark 13:32 where it
says &ldquo;neither the Son,&rdquo; Satan is identified as &ldquo;the son of perdition&rdquo; in the
Bible.  And it is also interesting in the book of Job when the sons of God came
to present themselves before God in Heaven, it says &ldquo;and Satan came also among
them.&rdquo;  This is said twice.  So I think that it could refer to Satan there.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  How about referring to mankind
who are not of the elect?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  No man knows, not even the elect.  We cannot
know of ourselves, as it says in Acts 1:7:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;It is not for [<i>of</i>] you to know the times or the
seasons&hellip;   </p>

<p>When we were able to know that May 21 was Judgment Day, that
came from God.  God is able to impart that information.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Esther 9:10, Haman&rsquo;s ten
sons were slain in Shushan the palace.  Then in Esther 9:14, it says that they
hanged Haman and his ten sons.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>They hanged Haman&rsquo;s ten sons at that
time, not Haman.  </p>

<p>This is significant.  Haman who clearly represents Satan,
had ten sons. This is significant because if we look at Revelation 13, we find
the beast that comes up out of the sea.  &ldquo;The beast&rdquo; is a name for Satan.  It
says in the middle of Revelation 13:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;having seven heads and ten horns&hellip;    </p>

<p>In Esther, we read that Haman had ten sons, and these sons
would identify with these ten horns.  </p>

<p>On May 21, Haman (or Satan) is put down.  He is humiliated. 
He is brought low and Christ is exalted.  Haman is even killed, like we read in
Isaiah 14.  Remember the language of Isaiah 14:7-10 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The whole earth is at rest&hellip;  </p>

<p>We will tie this into Zechariah 1 later.  Then it
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>and </i>is quiet: they break forth into singing. Yea, the
fir trees rejoice at thee, <i>and </i>the cedars of Lebanon, <i>saying, </i>Since
thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the king of Babylon or Satan.  Then it
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet <i>thee </i>at thy
coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, <i>even </i>all the chief ones of the
earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All
they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou
become like unto us?  </p>

<p>If you read Isaiah 14, it clearly reads as though Satan were
slain.  In a way he was, but he continues to exist.  </p>

<p>This is why the ten sons are significant.  This is really
referring to Satan himself, because the ten horns and the beast are one and the
same.  But as for how God is viewing them, He gave the beast rule in the
church.  Then after the end of the great tribulation, the beast is put down,
his rule is taken away, and yet Satan continues to exist as he does now and
will until the very last day.  </p>

<p>Also compare what happened with Babylon at the end of 70
years.  King Cyrus, who is a type of Christ, came and took Babylon.  Where was
the king of Babylon at that time?  He was at a banquet of wine.  Do you
remember that?  Just like when Haman meets his fate at a banquet of wine, the
king of Babylon at the end of 70 years is at a banquet of wine and he is slain
that very night.  </p>

<p>God is confirming this.  Yes; Satan lost all power but he
exists, and this is because God has another plan.  May 21 was not the physical
destruction or the end in that sense, but it was Judgment Day.  Now the plan is
to try the faith over a period of time of all those who said that they were
believers, because they are going to misunderstand or not fully comprehend what
happened on May 21.  October 21 is like another blow to them, and yet it is
right on course.  </p>

<p>Haman dies, and yet there is no mention of October 21 in the
book of Esther.  Then there is a set time path that is straight from May 21 to
the Feast of Purim.  And what is the Feast of Purim?  It is a time when the
Jews avenge themselves of their enemies and then enter into rest.  This is
exactly parallel to the Jews who destroyed their enemies in the land of Canaan
and then rested afterwards and stood in their lot, because the land was given
to them by lot.  </p>

<p>So we have this match with the Feast of Purim.  You kill
your enemies, you then rest, and then you stand in your lot, like God said to
Daniel, &ldquo;at the end of the days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #8</i>): 
</b>With regard to Haman&rsquo;s tens sons being killed twice, would this have to do
with the second death?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes, probably.  Also, this really sets
up that interesting situation that Purim is a feast.  We have the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month, but they rested on the 14<sup>th</sup> day
and the 15<sup>th</sup> day.  It really stretches over a period of three days. 
We have the Bible speak of 12/13, but it also mentions 12/14 and 12/15.  </p>

<p>What happened was that on the 13<sup>th</sup> day, they
killed their enemies in Shushan and in all of the provinces.  Then Esther asked
the king if they could do it again the next day, and so it was only in Shushan
that they slew on the 14<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>So out there in all of those provinces, they killed their
enemies on the 13<sup>th</sup> day, and then they rested on the 14<sup>th</sup>
day.  In Shushan only, they killed their enemies on the 13<sup>th</sup> and the
14<sup>th</sup> day, and then they rested on the 15<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>This means that all of the world will be on the Feast of
Purim at the same time.  Some might experience more of the feast while others
experience less of the feast, as far as God fulfilling this spiritually, but we
actually have Biblical information that says that those in Shushan experience
more of the feast than those in the rest of the provinces; but it was all the
feast.  </p>

<p>In other words, let us say that March 7<sup>th</sup> comes
in Australia first.  Yesterday around 4 or 5 P.M., I started hearing reports
that it was already the New Year in this country and in that country.  This was
how it was when we were waiting for the date of May 21.  Other countries had
already reached May 21, and then we heard that nothing happened.  Then they
left May 21 while others entered into that date.  We were thinking that even if
things had happened at that point, what about those who were already on May 22<sup>nd</sup>? 
</p>

<p>In this case, Australia enters day one of the feast, but we are
not in the feast yet.  Then they go to day two, which is the 14<sup>th</sup>
day.  We enter day one, which is the 13<sup>th</sup> day for us; and yet
everyone will be on this same feast everywhere in the world at the same time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>The true believers who are
asleep will rise up first.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Do you mean the resurrection at the
end?    </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Yes.  Would they be already at
the feast at a certain time and then finally be alive with the true believers
going up to meet them in the sky?  The dead in Christ will go up first though,
right?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  How ever God is going to do this, we know
that it does say that the dead in Christ will rise first.  I do not think that
the Bible indicates at what hour this will be, because it is laid out over a
three-day period.  It could be potentially the 13<sup>th</sup> day or it could
be the rest days of the 14<sup>th</sup> or the 15<sup>th</sup>.  We cannot know
the precise day or hour.  We just know that this feast will occur as God has
locked in May 21 to the book of Esther.  Then the natural time path just goes
to the next time that Purim is observed.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you compare Esther
5:1 with Hebrews 9:3-4?  Is the inner court of the king&rsquo;s house a picture of
the Holiest of Holies?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Esther 5:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on <i>her </i>royal
<i>apparel, </i>and stood in the inner court of the king's house&hellip;    </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 9:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
Holiest of all; Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
overlaid round about with gold, wherein <i>was </i>the golden pot that had
manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;  </p>

<p>Yes; the inner court is a picture of the Holiest of Holies. 
It is God&rsquo;s dwelling place; and we read of Ahasuerus being seated on his
throne.  </p>

<p>Concerning the golden scepter, remember that this statement
is made in Hebrews 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But unto the Son <i>he saith, </i>Thy throne, O God, <i>is </i>for
ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness <i>is </i>the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
</p>

<p>So Esther needs Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.  Actually, Esther
becomes a picture of Christ.  </p>

<p>What we will find, and we will try to discuss this more next
week, but notice that prior to her entering into the king that there is a
period of fasting of three nights and days.  This was a period of intense
fasting, as we read in Esther 4:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also
and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember that when Esther enters into the king, this leads
right up to May 21.  There was an intense period of fasting prior to her
entering in.  On the third day of the fast, she enters in.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, what does fasting point to in the Bible?  It
points to getting the Gospel out.  God tells us in Isaiah 58, &ldquo;<i>Is </i>not
this the fast that I have chosen?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Was there a time of intense fasting leading up to May 21 in
getting the Gospel out?  Yes; there was and it was a time like never before.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people were fasting leading up to the moment that
Esther went into the king.  Esther is a type of Christ.  Christ, of course,
paid for the sins of His elect before the foundation of the world.  He did all
of the work at that time.  But still, He interceded on behalf of His people
whenever we can say that they became saved.  It was as if Christ was there
before the Father saying, &ldquo;I have paid for this one&rsquo;s sins,&rdquo; and interceding
for them.  </p>

<p>So when Esther goes into the king and the king says, &ldquo;What
wilt thou, queen Esther? and what <i>is </i>thy request? it shall be even given
thee to the half of the kingdom,&rdquo; basically, at that point, she is making
intercession for all of the Jews in the provinces; and all of the &ldquo;Jews&rdquo; become
saved on or prior to May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>There is then only a working out of this, because time still
has to go to the 12<sup>th</sup> month of Adar, but all of the &ldquo;Jews&rdquo; were
interceded for and basically saved at that point.  It just becomes a matter of
working out the details.  But when the king says that the Jews can write a
second letter and that the Jews can avenge themselves, we have to ask when we
can avenge ourselves.  </p>

<p>Maria asked me a good question, &ldquo;I do not understand.  How
can God allow the Jews to avenge themselves?&rdquo;  They typify the elect; and when
is the only point when the elect can avenge themselves of their enemies?  It is
on the very last day.  That is the end of all things.  Actually, this is what
God does with His people as He ends the world and so forth; that is, He brings
vengeance on the people of the world.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>A few weeks ago in your
study, Esther Part 5, you said that God&rsquo;s people who are married to Him and who
are the Bride of Christ can never be divorced, that they can never be put away
or put asunder and separated from Him no matter what sin they commit.  What
about the true believers in the churches prior to the end of the church age who
had the Holy Spirit living in them and were doing their best to obey Scripture
but who stayed in their churches throughout the end of the church age, through
May 21<sup>st</sup>, and to this day?  Could these folks, including some of our
loved ones, be part of the Bride of Christ whom Christ would never divorce no
matter what sins they committed, as you said?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No.  It is true, no matter what sins
we commit, they can be forgiven; but there are also other principles at work
that we cannot avoid.  When God saves someone, He puts His Spirit within them
and He gives that person an ongoing desire to do the will of God.  They might
still sin, like David, and do something grievous.  They can still do that, but
they will not continually do that.  </p>

<p>For instance, someone in the world becomes saved.  Every
Friday and Saturday night, he was in the bar.  He becomes saved and maybe after
salvation he even goes back to the bar, but then he gets so convicted, &ldquo;I know
that I cannot do this and I know that I cannot be here.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is exactly how it would be with anyone in the church. 
God led His people out of the churches and none stayed there when the final day
of May 21 came.  I am sorry to say this, but this is how it is.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
