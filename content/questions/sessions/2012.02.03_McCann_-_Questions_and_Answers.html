  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">01:32</span> Using the Gregorian calendar, 147 days is seen twice to equal 294 days.  Using the calendar of Noah&rsquo;s day, 147 is seen once, going from the 17th day of the 7th month to Adar 14.  So we see a total of three times that 147 is used.  3x147 = 441.  When we add 146 days, 147 days, and 148 days, which we get from Adar 13th, 14th, and 15th, all going from the 17th day of the 7th month using Noah&rsquo;s calendar, we also get 441 days.  I am wondering if by doing this whether or not God is making a connection between the two calendars.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">14:39</span> Is it significant that the 147 days ends up on March 9th?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">20:53</span> From everything I have read, it was the 15th day of May in our calendar that the warning went out to Noah.  I wanted to point out that from the 15th of May to March 9th is 299 days.  This breaks down to 13x23.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">22:06</span> Some of my friends believe and trust in Jesus Christ and try to follow His commands in Scripture.  What if their doctrine is not completely accurate and leads them to conduct their lives in a way that is not quite in line with Scripture?  Do you think that they are saved?  Should I tell them about Purim and how that might be the end of the world?  What if someone occasionally attends a church but is not a member?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">26:47</span> The billboard in Philadelphia was supposed to go up on 2/7, next week, but I was told today that it is actually up now.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">28:22</span> God said in Genesis 1:26-27, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,&rdquo; and then He goes on to say, &ldquo;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.&rdquo;  Do we know what part of us is made in the image of God?  If we do, did this change when we fell into sin?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">33:00</span> Can you please explain Esther 7:7-8?  Also, why did the king go into the palace garden?  Is there a spiritual meaning to this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:31</span> Within what part of the timeline does Luke 10:18 and Isaiah 14:12-15 fall?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:35</span> Where do you think evil ultimately comes from?  </li>
  </ol>
