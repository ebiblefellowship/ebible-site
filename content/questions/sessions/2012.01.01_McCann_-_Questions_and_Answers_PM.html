  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">00:00</span> God seems to be opening up His Word more and more and it does indeed look like He is pointing us to March 7th.  Have you considered when we go from the Biblical calendar of the 23rd day of the 7th month to the 13th day of the 12th month that this is 144 days?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">02:28</span> Is the Feast of Purim the Feast of Lots, and am I correct in understanding that &ldquo;lot&rdquo; has different meanings?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">07:32</span> (Continued from Question #2):  Would we be looking for this inheritance to be given out on a certain day?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">10:25</span> Could you compare Esther 5:1 with Esther 8:9?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">16:41</span> With this new information that is coming out, what do we do with the five months that we read about in Revelation 9?  Also, was there any significance to the date of October 21st?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:30</span> (Continued from Question #5):  So in terms of the true believers being raptured, when are saying that this will probably take place?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">20:53</span> (Continued from Question #6):  When the rapture actually takes place, are you looking for something to take place here on this earth after the believers are raptured before the new heavens and the new earth take place or will things end with the rapture?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">21:35</span> In your message today concerning Noah being shut in the ark, you still believe that salvation is over.  In terms of each of us who have loved ones who we know at this particular junction are not saved, what do we do in terms of trying to get the Gospel to them?  Do we just pray for them?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">29:52</span> In light of this new information that we are learning from the book of Esther, could you explain Revelation 9:4-5, especially the phrase &ldquo;they should be tormented five months&rdquo;? </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:20</span> Could you please read and comment on 2 Peter 3:17-18?  It seems to me that after October 21, many of us are perhaps starting to doubt many of the truths that the Bible revealed.  I think that God is admonishing us to beware not to forsake those things that we have come to know just because October 21 did not happen like we thought it would.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">35:12</span> In relation to Revelation 9:12, was October 21st one of the woes?  What are the other two?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:55</span> In Esther 1:19, it does not say that Vashti was put away or divorced.  Can you comment on this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">40:16</span> (Continued from Question #12):  Would it not be better to state that Vashti represents the churches of our day?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:44</span> Can you explain where the Bible points to March of 2012 as the end?  Would you say that this date in March is locked in or is there other information that you are still looking at?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">48:12</span> Please compare Matthew 7:1-2 with John 5:21-22.  Is it not wiser to refrain from deciding who is and who is not a true believer, especially among our loved ones, even those who are still in the churches?  </li>
  </ol>
