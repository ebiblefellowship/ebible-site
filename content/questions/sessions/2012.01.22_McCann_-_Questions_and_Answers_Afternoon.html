  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">00:24</span> I want to stay faithful to my husband, but I am attracted to someone else.  Can you think of some passages besides Genesis 2:24 that would help me control my thoughts and stay faithful?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">05:45</span> Can you compare Psalm 137:8-9 with Purim for the believers?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:54</span> Can you please check James 1:12-14, particularly verse 13?  Is it always Satan who tests people?  Does God ever test people?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">21:55</span> Please read Mark 3:28-29.  Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit delivers a horrible fate.  Given our utter disappointments on May 21st and October 21st, maybe we need to be careful about what we say against all churches in case it is our method of interpreting Scripture that is at fault.  What do you think?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">26:16</span> Learning with Brother Camping through the Word of God, I remember that he said that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is narrowly defined.  Could it be that every sin grieves the Holy Spirit?  Can you explain the narrow definition that Mr. Camping brought out?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:17</span> Can you read Amos 8:10-11?  Is this referring to there being no more Gospel going out?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">28:50</span> Can you look at Isaiah 15:2-3?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">29:19</span> Can you look at Jeremiah 48:37?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">30:00</span> Could you look at Genesis 6:16 in relation to the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; that is also translated as &ldquo;noon day&rdquo;?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">31:00</span> I am not able to understand the reasoning or purpose to publicly announce to the unsaved world the end of the world (March 2012) a second time.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">36:46</span> A question was raised about the question mark on the new date for the end of the world.  Can you comment?  </li>
  </ol>
