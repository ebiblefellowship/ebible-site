<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Before we begin, let me just say that
I do not see any information that is pointing to any specific date right now. 
We know that the information about the flood is a possibility.  The key word is
that it is only possible, and I do not want to get into discussing
possibilities with this particular date or that particular date because I just
do not see, outside of the flood account, much evidence that points to this.  </p>

<p>Some people say that we should not be looking for dates.  In
a sense, this is true.  We do not want to specifically just look for anything. 
We want to study the Bible to find the truth concerning all information, but one
problem that we have now is that doctrine is tied to dates.  We just cannot get
away from this.  For instance, the end of the church age is tied to the
Biblical calendar, and it is our knowledge of the Biblical calendar that helps
us to know that the end of the church age is here.  </p>

<p>Someone might say that we do not need the Biblical calendar
to know this because there are all kinds of verses that tell us that the
churches will go apostate and fall away, and we see this all around us.  This
is true.  There are hundreds of verses that tell us this and they have been in
the Bible for centuries, but it is only the calendar that has given us the
insight and the understanding to realize that now is the time when the
&ldquo;abomination of desolation&rdquo; is in &ldquo;the holy place&rdquo; and that now is the time to &ldquo;depart
out&rdquo; of the midst.  </p>

<p>In other words, it is the calendar that activated our
understanding towards those verses.  Without the calendar, it could be argued
how we could know that now is when the church age is over.  </p>

<p>Again, people might say, &ldquo;Look at the condition of the
churches,&rdquo; but this is something that is outside of the Bible.  This is
external to the Bible and this is not the proof.  Likewise, there is doctrine
involved with May 21, and there is doctrine involved with the time that we are
in now that is related to the calendar.  </p>

<p>So it is very important for us to us to understand what God
is doing and where we are in time or in His program of time.  We have gone
beyond certain areas that we did not expect to go beyond; and so I think that
we have to slow down and study and pray for wisdom.  God can grant us
understanding at any point if it is His will to do so.  </p>

<p>Even though this may be uncomfortable, I think that we just
need to wait on the Lord.  We wait on Him to instruct us.  I do not think that
it would be profitable for us to get into a lot of questions, questions that
require more information right now in order to properly answer.  </p>

<p>So this is why at this time that we are not going to get
into certain questions.  I would prefer questions related to the study or
questions related to topics that were discussed in the study, like election or
predestination or things like that, rather than other questions, which I know
you have because I have those same questions about things that we are thinking
about that are related to the time that we are in.  If we can do this, then we
will have a question and answer session for a short period of time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>In our physical bodies, we
are now pilgrims in this present world.  If we are elect and are saved, then in
our new hearts/new spirits, are we even now pilgrims in the eternal Kingdom of God,
or is there evidence in the Bible that states that we are somehow returning
home and that we are not a stranger there?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We are not strangers there.  We are
citizens.  Hebrews 11 tells us this.  I think that there is a verse in Hebrews
that tells us that we are citizens of the Kingdom of God.  I cannot put my
finger on the verse right now, but we do have a citizenship there.  We are not strangers
to the Kingdom of God.  We &ldquo;sit together in heavenly <i>places </i>in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;  Christ is ruling in the Kingdom of God and that is our place.  We are &ldquo;in
Him,&rdquo; and so God does not view us as strangers in Heaven at all.    </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I believe that the verse is
Ephesians 2:19.  Can you look at this?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  It says in Ephesians 2:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;  </p>

<p>I think that there is another verse that goes along with
this, too, that may be in Hebrews, but this says it very well.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Because we are the elect,
can we technically say that we are somewhat sinless?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is a good question and I am glad
that you brought this up because I said that the new heart that God has given
us is without sin.  I said this because the Bible says this a couple of different
times.  One place is in 1John 3:9:    </p>

<p class="verse">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.  </p>

<p>It is typical of the Bible to make a statement like this,
because this will immediately make us think of other verses.  In this case, we
do not have to go very far, because it says in 1John 1:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
word is not in us.  </p>

<p>So we have this statement and probably many other statements
that seemingly contradict this statement that says that if we are born of God,
we do not commit sin; yet this other verse says that if we say that we are
without sin, we are a liar.  </p>

<p>Really, the Bible is enough to get someone to pull their
hair out in frustration in trying to look at these statements, but this is how
God wrote the Bible in order to allow people to make charges, such as there are
contradictions or such as there are errors in the Bible.  After all, even the
same writer of this 1<sup>st</sup> Epistle of John cannot keep things
straight&hellip;right?  </p>

<p>Well; no.  What God has done is that He makes these kinds of
statements, but we have to search out everything in the Bible in order to put
them all together to find harmony.  When we do, we realize that God has given
us a new heart/new spirit, a new born-again soul that is perfect and without
sin and that cannot sin.  </p>

<p>In our soul existence, we cannot sin.  It is pure and holy
and there is no sin in our new nature.  However, what we still have is our
physical body; and in our physical body, we sin.  We have corruption and this
is why our physical body is going to die.  It is because of this sinful corruption;
and so we are split.  </p>

<p>Even within ourself there can be a battle where our new
spirit/new heart wants us to be obedient to God; but in our flesh, well, we are
dead.  We are seeing corruption.  There is sin that indwells our physical body;
and so there is a struggle even within the child of God.  </p>

<p>But this explains how, on one hand, we recognize that the
Bible tells us that there is no sin; and yet on the other hand, we have sin. 
Since we are one personality, since we are made up of body and soul, we admit
that we have sin; but God, in a couple of verses, is specifically looking at
that new nature that He has put within us.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>How can we know when we
have forgiven someone?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not know how we can perfectly
know if we have forgiven someone.  Maybe we can turn this question around,
because we can know when we have not forgiven someone.  </p>

<p>If we are thinking bitterly about someone, if we are
thinking bitterly about what they have done to us and if we are thinking of
getting back at them in any way, maybe even in our minds, then this can be an
indicator that we have not forgiven someone.  </p>

<p>All we can do if someone has offended us in any way is to go
to God and to pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I pray for this person.  Lord, I want to tell you
about this situation.  I think that they have done wrong to me.&rdquo;  What this
should really do at this point is to help us to remember all of the wrong that
we have done.  </p>

<p>God gives us examples of this in the Bible, like the parable
of the man who was forgiven a great debt by his lord; then someone came up to
him who owed him just a little bit, a far lesser amount than he owed his lord
that he was forgiven for.  Then that man grabbed the one who owed him a little
bit by the throat and demanded payment.  </p>

<p>So God gives us illustrations like this to help us to keep
in mind that God has forgiven us a &ldquo;multitude of sins,&rdquo; as He tells us in 1
Peter 4:8.  He has showed abundant mercy towards us.  He has forgiven us so
many sins that we cannot even count them they are so numerous.  He has
completely forgiven again and again and again.  </p>

<p>Now, here is someone and maybe it is hurtful and grievous
and maybe they have sinned against you one hundred times, but what is that in
comparison to what you have done towards God and His law?  </p>

<p>It says in Ephesians 4:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.  </p>

<p>God reminds us to look to Jesus and to look at the
forgiveness that He has bestowed.  This is the example of how we should
forgive.  </p>

<p>If we go to God in prayer about any person and we are
reminded of these verses, the child of God realizes that this is true.  How
could we hold a grudge?  How could we be reviled and desire to revile again? 
How could we not forgive someone when we have been forgiven?  </p>

<p>So we start to develop a conscience about this.  A believer
could sin in this way like they could in any way, but I do not think that they
would continue in this kind of a sin because God has made them very sensitive
to what He has done for them.  Through prayer and being reminded of the
Scriptures, they would not want any part of this.  </p>

<p>It would be more affliction for the child of God to be
involved in not forgiving someone than the affliction of whatever that person
did towards them, and so they would not want any part in holding bitterness
towards someone.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>The Bible calls angels
&ldquo;ministering spirits.&rdquo;  When I read the Bible, angels seem to only minister to
Christ; and so I wanted to know if there are places in the Bible where angels
have ministered to human beings.  Is this part of their role as well?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>You are referring to Hebrews 1 where
it is speaking of angels.  It says in Hebrews 1:14:    </p>

<p class="verse">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation?  </p>

<p>This would indicate that the believers who are the &ldquo;heirs of
salvation&rdquo; are the ones who are being ministered to.   </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  So they do minister to human
beings?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Yes.  I do not know how, but God uses them
somehow to minister to the &ldquo;heirs of salvation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I missed some of the study
and do not know if you have talked about the meaning of the five areas
mentioned in 1 Peter 1.  Do they have any spiritual meanings?  Do their names
mean anything to us?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I did not get into that in the study. 
It says in 1Peter 1:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
 Asia, and Bithynia,  </p>

<p>We find a few of these places mentioned in Acts 16.  It says
in Acts 16:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After
they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered
them not.  </p>

<p>So we find Galatia, Asia, and Bithynia, which are three of
the same places mentioned in these couple of verses.  </p>

<p>I am not exactly sure why God names each one of these
places, but it is interesting to notice that Acts 16 takes place after the
Great Commission in Matthew 16 when Jesus commands, &ldquo;Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature.&rdquo;  Here, we have the apostles trying to
do this, and yet the Holy Ghost forbids the Word to be preached in Asia.  </p>

<p>It also says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them
not.  </p>

<p>In just thinking about things, we have to admit that there
is an historical precedent for God allowing whole nations &ndash; probably some in
Asia, but we also know this to be true of the American Indians in North America
or the natives of South America or the aborigines of the South Pacific, as well
as probably many other places &ndash; again, whole nations of men, women, and
children who lived for generations &ndash; not just a year, not just for 2300 days,
but for generations without the Word of God; and, therefore, without
salvation.  For centuries, some areas did not have the Word of God.  </p>

<p>So even in Acts 16, God Himself is forbidding the preaching
of the Gospel to a certain area of the world; and yet this is for His own
purposes.  His wisdom is way beyond our wisdom.  He knows what He is doing.  </p>

<p>All that we can understand is that, obviously, there were no
elect people who lived in those particular regions during the period of time
when the Gospel was not preached to them; and so generations would have come
without elect individuals within them.  </p>

<p>I am just saying this because we have to think about these
things.  As far as what is going on today, this is something for us to
consider.  </p>

<p>As far as those five areas, five were intentionally chosen
in order to typify grace, especially in the case of 1 Peter, but we also know
that the number 5 points to judgment.  We can learn more as we look at the
particular places that were mentioned, but we did not go into this earlier
today.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Was the church age also
spiritual?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not think that I understand the
question.  The church age is basically a theological term that is describing
the period of time from the sending out of the Gospel on the day of Pentecost
in 33 A.D. until the end of that period of time or the end of the church age in
1988.  </p>

<p>God identifies all of those who became saved during those
1,955 years as &ldquo;firstfruits.&rdquo;  He mentions this in Revelation 14 where there
are 144,000 who are the &ldquo;firstfruits unto God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Pentecost is a feast that identified with firstfruits and it
was one of the feasts that God spiritually fulfilled during that period of time
that we know of as the church age, and yet there was another period because
there was another part of the harvest that came at the end of the year, which
is the Feast of Ingathering.  That feast identified with the great multitude
being saved during the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Was it spiritual?  The church age was literal in the sense
that God established the churches and used the churches over the course of
1,955 years; but once the church age ended, He no longer used them and He
brought judgment upon them.  </p>

<p>What is spiritual is that we cannot see that judgment.  When
the Holy Spirit came out of the midst of the churches, no one could see that
take place.  God is Spirit and when He removed His Spirit, no one could see
that; and so that was a spiritual judgment upon them.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone for sharing their questions
and their comments.  Lord willing, we will also continue with questions
following the study next Sunday.  For now, I am going to say thank you for
joining with us.  </p>
