  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">25:39</span> Do you feel or think that the judgments/wrath or rapture will happen to everyone at the same time or will it be like in Esther where it happens to some of the provinces before it begins and ends in Shushan?  Is there evidence or additional information in Esther or anywhere else in the Bible that would illustrate how this might all happen throughout the world?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:50</span> Could we look at Isaiah 4:4 in relation to the phrase &ldquo;purged&hellip;by the spirit of burning&rdquo;?  This made me think of the verses that tell us that God will destroy the world with fire and burning.  I am starting to wonder now if the world is not going to be destroyed in a physical way because of these phrases &ldquo;the spirit of judgment&rdquo; and &ldquo;the spirit of burning.&rdquo;  </li>
  <li><span class="time">40:39</span> You mentioned on Sunday with regards to what happened on the 17th day of the 7th month that this was spiritual in nature.  Could this spiritual event that took place on the 17th day of the 7th month be a doubling of the 147 days?  If this was not it, what was the spiritual event that took place on October 15th of 2011?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">47:49</span> You did say that Purim will be experienced differently by different people in different sections.  Is there some way to prepare for Purim in how we should be thinking about this; for example, should we be thinking of the rest for God&rsquo;s people or should we be thinking of the fulfillment of our inheritance?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">50:00</span> In Revelation 14, God thrusts His sickle into the earth twice, once in verse 16 (without much explanation) and again a final time in verse 19.  Is this a good picture of doubling the judgment spiritually?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">53:40</span> Before May 21, we had the infallible proof of 722,500 days.  If I remember correctly, it was noted that the factors were doubled and were shortly going to come to pass.  Is it possible that this same principle in Genesis applies to the doubling of judgment?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">57:53</span> I looked at a couple of spreadsheets that someone else did and I noticed that the 147 days lined up perfectly with our Gregorian calendar.  On someone else&rsquo;s spreadsheet, I noticed that none of it seemed to line up, but I believed that they used the Julian calendar to line up the first day of Nissan.  If we are saying that March 7-9th is supposed to line up with the feast of Purim, which is the 12-15th, what calendar are we using at this point?  If you look at the Hebrew calendar, it seems that nothing really lines up very well.  How do you explain this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">1:02:26</span> (Continued from previous question):  Are we completely throwing out October 21st as a date and instead using October 15th as the date?  If I am understanding this correctly, October 21st was not a date for us and that it was just something that was only five months in our calendar with our understanding of the 153 days.  </li>
  </ol>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The Bible is the eternal Word of God. 
It is the only place where we can go and have confidence and trust and faith
that what we read is the truth.  We cannot really have this confidence anywhere
else in this world with anything else in a 100% whole-hearted way.  Only with
the Bible can we be absolutely sure that we are hearing the truth.  </p>

<p>The Bible has the truth.  The Bible says of itself, &ldquo;Thy
word is truth,&rdquo; just as Jesus is said to be &ldquo;the way, the truth, and the life,&rdquo;
because Jesus is the Word &ldquo;made flesh.&rdquo;  What is true of Him is true of the
Bible.  The Bible is truth in every area that we look, and so we search the
Bible to find out what is truth concerning this verse or this topic or this
idea.  </p>

<p>This is what we have done for quite awhile now concerning
the timing of the end of the world; but a lot of people like to say that we are
setting dates and they scorn the idea that man can ever set a date and know the
future concerning Christ&rsquo;s return and the end of the world.  </p>

<p>I agree with this.  I agree completely that if man sets a
date, if man says that Christ will come and the world will end and if this is
coming from an individual, then it is worthy to be scorned.  This is because
man does not know what is going to happen tomorrow; no man does.  </p>

<p>Of course, of ourselves, we do not know anything about the
end of this world.  The difference is that if we go to the Bible on this
subject, as well as on any subject, and we follow God&rsquo;s methodology and we
search the Bible in order to discover truth concerning this subject, then if we
come up with a date, it is not coming from us; it is coming from the Bible.  </p>

<p>Someone might say and have a lot of weight behind saying
this, &ldquo;Yes; well, you did that with May 21 and October 21,&rdquo; and that is true. 
Even when we go to the Bible and we search for the timing of the end and we
follow God&rsquo;s methodology, we still have to admit that we have limitations in
being men.  Yet God did reveal May 21 as Judgment Day and that was correct.  </p>

<p>So in the proclamation of Purim, we do have evidence that we
were correct.  God opened up the eyes of His people concerning this date.  We
then told others and shared this with the world, and we were correct.  We were
incorrect concerning the exact nature of what would take place, but we were
correct that May 21 was the Day of Judgment.  May 21 was when Judgment Day
began.  </p>

<p>We were also correct that there would be a period of five
months and that this would be God&rsquo;s punishment for sin.  Yet at the same time,
we did not understand everything perfectly concerning the five months.  Now at
this time, God is once again correcting us and we are seeing that, yes, the
penalty for sin was to be a five-month period of torment.  </p>

<p>This was what God required as His judgment upon this world. 
However, we have now been corrected to see that the length of this five-month
period was 147 days, not 153 as we had previously thought.  But in making this
correction, we are now following the Biblical calendar.  We have not pulled
another date out of our hat; this comes from the Bible.  </p>

<p>2/17 identifies with May 21.  7/17 identifies with October
14<sup>th</sup> and October 15<sup>th</sup>.  This is because each of our days
has two overlapping Hebrew or Biblical days.  The Hebrew day begins in the
evening.  7/17 or Tishri 17 began October 14<sup>th</sup> in the evening and it
continued into the next day of October 15<sup>th</sup>.  Most of the Hebrew day
of Tishri 17 is October 15<sup>th</sup>, but a portion is on October 14<sup>th</sup>. 
Then from Tishri 17, which is a space of 147 days, we double this.  </p>

<p>This is new information that we are now learning from the
Bible that we did not know before.  It is just impossible, really, for us to
know these things in advance, unless God opens up our eyes in advance to know them. 
</p>

<p>We saw that God&rsquo;s way of teaching us some of these things is
that we first experienced a set-back in our expectations.  For instance, we
reached October 21 and apparently nothing happened.  We went beyond that
particular date and then we were wondering what happened because Judgment Day
was supposed to be for five months.  </p>

<p>For awhile, we studied and prayed and went to God asking
Him, &ldquo;Lord, what has happened?  What have You done?&rdquo;  When we do this, if it is
God&rsquo;s good pleasure, He opens up our understanding and we learn an extra bit of
the overall timeline.  </p>

<p>This is what has happened now because we now see that there
is a second and final five-month stage, because it was God&rsquo;s plan to double the
torment, to double the destruction, to double the penalty for sin.  </p>

<p>After we make this first correction concerning Tishri 17 of
147 days and we double the number of days, we then arrive on Adar 15; and Adar
15 is the last day of the feast of Purim.  It is the day that has entered into
our focus.  It is the day that the Bible has directed us to.  </p>

<p>This is because we learned earlier in the book of Esther
that all of the major events that took place on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the
2<sup>nd</sup> month were within a timeline that led us to the feast of Purim. 
It was a day that was established to be a day of destruction for the Jews but
was turned to be a day of destruction for the enemies of the Jews, and this is
a very good way of describing Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Initially, all of the elect were subject to wrath even as others;
that is, we were going to die on that day because of our sin, just as everyone
else, but God turns this when He saves us and it is only the enemies of God or
the enemies of His Kingdom (all of the unsaved) who die.  Not one of His elect
people die, and this is exactly what the feast of Purim pictures.  </p>

<p>So we find two major tie-ins with the feast of Purim that
now tie into May 21 and a five-month space from that point.  The five-month
space is then doubled and lands on the feast of Purim; and this connects all of
the dots.  We now have a complete spiritual chronology within the book of
Esther.  </p>

<p>For awhile, we saw how Esther laid out in an amazing fashion
a spiritual chronology that followed Israel, the church age, the end of the
church age, the promotion of Satan during the great tribulation, even the
proclamation of the Gospel going out into the world by which many became broken
and saved.  Then the book of Esther spends a long period of time on Judgment
Day, May 21.  It devotes over, at least, three chapters to that single day. 
But what was conspicuous by its absence was a five-month mark in that
chronology.  This is something that we could not see.  </p>

<p>So from the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month,
when Haman was humiliated and then destroyed and when Mordecai was exalted and
given the house of Haman, we saw posts go out into all of the provinces, but
nothing that related to the five months.  However, we find a span of ten months
from the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month until Adar 15.  I say
ten months even though we would normally be thinking of Adar 17, because this
is how it would look in our calendar; but I am saying this because of the space
of days.  It is 294 days in the book of Esther, just as it is 294 days in our
day, which is a doubled five-month period.  </p>

<p>So God did not focus on the single five months, but He does
have the length of time for Judgment Day in the book of Esther in the doubling
of the five months, which is a space of ten months.  So we have a complete
spiritual chronology now that covers the entire 10-month period that goes from
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month (or May 21) all the way to
Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Just think what had to happen in order for us to see this
double period of five months.  First of all, we had to have an additional date
that God gave us back in the book of Genesis in chapter 8.  In Genesis 7, God
is the One who told us so plainly that He shut the door on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  We know how significant this was because this
was the underlying day of May 21 in the Hebrew calendar.  </p>

<p>It is also God who gives a further date of 150 days later
(five months) as the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month.  This was
necessary for God to give us this date.  If He had not given us that date, then
none of this would work out.  Therefore, we are following a second date.  We
are being more Biblical and we are following more closely the flood account by
going to Tishri 17 (October 14/15) as the complete end of the five-month
period.  </p>

<p>Then God had to instill in His Word a law.  He had to place
this in His Word, because He cannot do something without His Law supporting
it.  He is bound by His Law.  He cannot do something more than His Law
requires.  </p>

<p>So within the Law of God, we find three times just in Exodus
22 this law requiring the doubling of punishment.  We read in Exodus 22:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be
ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.  </p>

<p>Exodus 22:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;if the thief be found, let him pay double. </p>

<p>Exodus 22:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>and </i>whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double
unto his neighbour.  </p>

<p>God is the One who put these laws in the Bible, but it does
not say this for every sin.  We do not read about double payment everywhere,
but God put it on the books.  He did place a law in the Bible concerning restitution
or double payment.  </p>

<p>Someone pointed out today that they drove by a construction
zone and there was a sign that said, &ldquo;All Fines Are Doubled in this Area.&rdquo; 
This is the good pleasure of the authorities.  They make the law.  If they
normally say that the penalty for speeding is so much, that is what the penalty
is.  But if they choose to be more safety conscious in a particular area like a
construction zone, they can choose to double the fine.  </p>

<p>What does this do?  It makes the person speeding through
that particular area think a little bit more as to whether or not they want a
double fine.  Do they want double punishment?  </p>

<p>So God takes this principle and He applies this to Babylon
in Revelation 18.  Is it not interesting that it is Babylon that we read of a
few times in the Bible where it says, &ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen,&rdquo; which is
a double statement concerning Babylon?  I cannot think of other nations that
are also very wicked in which God doubles this, like Egypt.  I do not think
that we read, &ldquo;Egypt is fallen, is fallen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Assyria is fallen, is fallen.&rdquo; 
But for Babylon, God doubles this a few times and tells us, &ldquo;Babylon is fallen,
is fallen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When did Babylon fall?  Historically, they fell after 70
years in 539 B.C. when the Medes and the Persians took the kingdom.  That
70-year space was an actual 70-year period but it was also an historical
parable picturing the length of the great tribulation.  The fall of Babylon,
that last day when the king of Babylon was slain (and he was slain in a banquet
of wine just as Haman was taken from a banquet of wine and hung), was the end
of that period of 70 years, which pictured the end of the great tribulation
that took place on May 21.  </p>

<p>So that was the day that was in view when the Bible says, &ldquo;Babylon
is fallen, is fallen&rdquo; and doubles it.  So we are not too surprised with what we
read in Revelation 18:6.  It says in Revelation 18:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;cup&rdquo; is the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath, and the end of the
great tribulation (May 21) was Judgment Day.  It was the end of the 23-year
great tribulation, which was, historically, the time that the fall of Babylon
pictured.  </p>

<p>So we read earlier in Revelation 18 the doubled statement, &ldquo;Babylon
the great is fallen, is fallen,&rdquo; and then we read here in Revelation 18:6, &ldquo;in
the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 18:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen,
and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.  </p>

<p>This is a reference to the penalty of torment, the five
months of torment.  This is the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; that is given to Babylon.  </p>

<p>Revelation 14:8 also says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Babylon is fallen, is fallen&hellip;   </p>

<p>Then it says Revelation 14:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels [<i>messengers</i>],
and in the presence of the Lamb:  </p>

<p>We can show how this identifies with the 5-month period as
this is the torment that is also referred to in Revelation 9.  Those five
months of torment are doubled.  </p>

<p>So now we just have to wonder what God is saying, because we
want to know the truth.  As we went to the book of Esther, we had many
questions, but God put His finger on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month in the midst of a timeline that leads to a day of destruction.  He shows
us how this identifies with the spiritual Judgment Day of May 21.  </p>

<p>He is now teaching us to go back to Genesis.  Once we do
this and we follow more closely the next date of 7/17 (Tishri 17), then we will
see that this was the space of five months.  Then we double this and it comes
out to the last day of the feast of Purim.  </p>

<p>Who is it that says in the Bible about Babylon, in the context
of the fall of Babylon which relates again to May 21:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;double unto her double&hellip;in the cup&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;so much torment and sorrow give her&hellip;  </p>

<p>I just do not know how anyone can put these things
together.  We could try for 1,000 years and never do this.  Just pick a couple
of dates, any dates that you would like, and go to the Bible and try to prove
these types of things about them and you will never be able to do this.  You
will never be able to do this.  I just do not know anyone who has the sort of
ability to make the Bible fit in this way.  </p>

<p>At this time, we are going to open up the room.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Do you feel or think that
the judgments/wrath or rapture will happen to everyone at the same time or will
it be like in Esther where it happens to some of the provinces before it begins
and ends in Shushan?  Is there evidence or additional information in Esther or
anywhere else in the Bible that would illustrate how this might all happen
throughout the world?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I think that Esther is teaching us
that the experience of the feast of Purim can be different, depending on your
location.  Those in Shushan were more involved in the destruction of their
enemies, because they did this for two days, but this was not true of the rest
of the provinces.  </p>

<p>Also, we would say that those in the other provinces
experienced more of the rest, because they destroyed their enemies on the 13<sup>th</sup>
and rested on the 14<sup>th</sup>; but at the same time, the 15<sup>th</sup>
became a day of rest.  </p>

<p>What this does is that it allows God to bring a worldwide
simultaneous judgment or completion of the judgment.  Since everyone is on the
feast, it does not particularly matter at what point because we can have
individuals experiencing different or varying degrees of this feast in the
world.  Some will experience more while some will experience less; and yet all
are on the feast.  I think that this remains intact.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Could we look at Isaiah 4:4
in relation to the phrase &ldquo;purged&hellip;by the spirit of burning&rdquo;?  This made me
think of the verses that tell us that God will destroy the world with fire and
burning.  I am starting to wonder now if the world is not going to be destroyed
in a physical way because of these phrases &ldquo;the spirit of judgment&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
spirit of burning.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Isaiah 4:4:    </p>

<p class="verse">When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by
the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.  </p>

<p>We are actually in the Day of Judgment now and God is
viewing this period of time as a time of &ldquo;fire.&rdquo;  This is the time of the
&ldquo;fiery trial&rdquo;; but at the end of this period of time, there will be an actual
fiery destruction, the end of this world, and then the re-creation of a new
heaven and a new earth.  </p>

<p>It says in 1 Corinthians 3:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is
Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble;  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;gold, silver, precious stones&rdquo; are typifying the
believers.  They will endure the fire, but the &ldquo;wood, hay, stubble&rdquo; will be
burned up in the fire.   </p>

<p>Then it says in 1 Corinthians 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for <span class="underline">the day</span>
shall declare it&hellip;  </p>

<p>Since we are in Judgment Day, we could say that we are in
&ldquo;the day&rdquo; of judgment, even though the actual length appears to be about 10
months; yet God views this all as a single day of judgment.  </p>

<p>So this says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for <span class="underline">the day</span>
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try
every man's work of what sort it is.  </p>

<p>We became familiar with the word &ldquo;manifest&rdquo; when we learned
that Jesus entered into the world to &ldquo;make manifest&rdquo; what He had done from the
foundation of the world in dying for the sins of His people and rising again
before the world even began.  </p>

<p>The Bible says that &ldquo;whatsoever doth make manifest is
light,&rdquo; and Christ came as the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; to shine the light on the
work that had already been done before the foundation of the world, which we
would otherwise have no knowledge of.  </p>

<p>So now we have a great many professing Christians.  We know
that those in the churches failed the test of the great tribulation.   When God
commanded them to come out and they refused, they were all bundled as tares for
the burning.  Judgment Day, May 21, began the fire.  At that point, tragically,
what was true in the church (where there would be no more salvation) became
true in all of the world.  </p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the very beginning of this
judgment burned them up.  This is because, at that time, they had no escape. 
Yet there were many outside of the church who professed to be Christians.  They
also had to be tried by fire and this had to become evident.  </p>

<p>The Bible speaks of a necessity.  We have a need of
patience.  The Bible says, &ldquo;For ye have need [<i>or necessity</i>] of patience,
that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.&rdquo;  But
why do we have a &ldquo;need of patience&rdquo;?  Does this just mean that we have a need
to wait?  </p>

<p>That is a part of this, but God helps us to understand why
this is a necessity in James 1:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Knowing <i>this, </i>that the trying of your faith worketh
patience. But let patience have <i>her </i>perfect work, that ye may be perfect
and entire, wanting nothing.  </p>

<p>So God set up this whole program of Judgment Day as a huge
testing program in order to bring this spiritual fire upon the profession of
faith of all those who are basically outside of the church.  This is because
all of those within the church have already been burned up in the fire as
tares; but since many outside of the church were obedient on the level of not
being in the church on that last day, in God&rsquo;s wisdom He designed a testing
program.  </p>

<p>First of all this testing program would begin by bringing a
spiritual judgment on May 21.  How can we see a spiritual thing?  We can only
see this through faith.  Therefore, if any who for whatever reason happened to
be outside of the church and they heard talk of a spiritual judgment,
especially as the physical aspect of the judgment was being emphasized to some
degree, we have firsthand experience with what happens because people just do
not buy this.  They did not see it and so they do not buy this.  </p>

<p>This is the exact same test that the churches failed when
they were told that the church age was over and that the Spirit of Christ had
left and that the spirit of Satan had entered in.  Those in the churches did
not see this and they did not buy it.  </p>

<p>This is very much parallel when those outside of the
churches now are facing a similar test.  It was a spiritual judgment.  Do you
believe God?  Many did not, but some continued even further along.  They waited
because there was another date.  </p>

<p>But we are now finding out that God, once again, had a plan
all along to double this.  Even if we had the correct space of five months
being 147 days, we would have once again reached that point with seemingly
nothing happening; and, once again, this would have been a severe test &ndash; and
this is what it has been.  These things are seen in the Bible and we see things
in the Bible through faith with spiritual eyes.  </p>

<p>Now again, what is the test?  Do we fail the test if we are
confused?  No.  Do we fail the test if we do not know what is going on or what
the Bible is teaching and if we are in a position of just greatly lacking
understanding?  No; that is not failing the test.  </p>

<p>But when all of a sudden you now hear people basically
joining forces and mimicking almost word for word exactly what the churches
were saying prior to May 21, which is that no man can know the day or hour,
they have failed the test.  Some are just going back to the world and some are
actually going back to the church itself.  </p>

<p>These are failing the test; and what is happening is that
this is becoming manifest.  The fire of this harsh and difficult period of time
is making this manifest and it is revealing and trying &ldquo;every man's work of
what sort it is.&rdquo;  Just as God brought the fire to the church, He has developed
again in His wisdom this particular fire for all of those outside of the
church.  </p>

<p>How can someone pass the test?  They can be confused and
actually not have a clue as to what is going on.  But what God&rsquo;s people do &ndash;
and this is why God emphasizes patience &ndash; is that He tells us, &ldquo;In your
patience possess ye your souls.&rdquo;  Patience is waiting on the Lord, waiting for
more information if it is God&rsquo;s good pleasure to open up the Bible to show us
what He is doing.  </p>

<p>We trusted the Bible and all of this came from the Bible. 
When we learned about May 21, it came from the Bible; and then we shared this
with the world.  God had to do it.  He used the faithful ministry of Family
Radio that He had been using for so many decades.  He proclaimed this message
to all the world.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people just knew.  They might not have known what was
going on, but they knew that God was doing something and that they just had to wait
without dumping things that they had learned from the Bible &ndash; solid things like
&ldquo;a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment,&rdquo; like the fact that the
church age was over, like the timeline that was derived right from the
genealogies in the Scriptures.  We did not dump these things.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people waited on the Lord.  As we have, we have continued
to study the Bible and we have learned some things.  Now we can see an outline
and we can see very clearly what God has done.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>You mentioned on Sunday
with regards to what happened on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup>
month that this was spiritual in nature.  Could this spiritual event that took
place on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month be a doubling of
the 147 days?  If this was not it, what was the spiritual event that took place
on October 15<sup>th</sup> of 2011?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>By the way, I am working right now
with someone with a spreadsheet to lay out the 147 days and the doubling of
it.  We hope to have this soon.  At that time, we will post this in the EBible
Facebook group and hopefully get it up on the website.  This should help people
to see this.  </p>

<p>We may have to start counting with May 21 or the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  Again, our Gregorian date of May 21 has two
Hebrew calendar dates.  It has the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  Then it has the evening of the 18<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>So May 21 concluded the great tribulation and it also began
the five months, just like when we look historically at this when Noah and his
family were in the ark: the door was shut, and the rain began.  So it was a
combination of God&rsquo;s people getting in and then the closure and the shutting of
the door so that no one else could get in.  </p>

<p>If we start on May 21 and we go to October 14<sup>th</sup>,
which is another way of saying that we are counting inclusively and including
May 21, we come to October 14<sup>th</sup>.  In the evening of October 14<sup>th</sup>,
Tishri 17 begins.  Then if we start counting from October 15<sup>th</sup>,
which is the larger portion of Tishri 17, October 15<sup>th</sup> in our
Gregorian calendar spans Tishri 17/18.  From this when we go 147 days, it falls
on Adar 15.  </p>

<p>There are different ways of counting.  We can see that God
has done this.  He has doubled this span of 147.  Your question is what
happened after five months.  The answer is the same thing that happened on May
21.  It was as though the cup was drunk dry, we could say, during the five
months of torment.  Then the Law of God said to double this.  </p>

<p>This is the spiritual judgment of that day.  It was an
extension of an additional five months, matching the first 147 days, until the
feast of Purim. So I would say that this is the spiritual significance of the
five-month mark; and, really, it is brilliant of God to work it out this way
and to bring people along with an expectation.  </p>

<p>On one hand, we have been thinking that this has been so
severe a test; and it has.  But this is the whole point.  It is a fire that is
refining gold and silver.  Therefore, it must be hot.  This is because God is
ready to bring the purified gold and silver into the final resting place.  He
is ready to bring His people into the Kingdom of Heaven.  Yet it has just been
the fact that all throughout history there have been those, for whatever reason,
who have clung to a profession of the true Gospel.  This was true in the church
and this has been true out of the church.  </p>

<p>It would actually be unlike God and completely out of His
character, just because some people identified with Him and with the
proclamation of His warning of judgment, if He just took them in.  Yet, on the other
hand, what if May 21 had been the end of all things and there were all sorts of
people who were following along and in agreement on every point and yet many of
them were left behind?  </p>

<p>God determined, just like He did for the church, that He
would give them a testing period.  He gave the church a testing program.  He
warned them again to see if they would hearken to Him.  If they did not
hearken, then it would become evident that they were His people in name only.  </p>

<p>Likewise, now a testing program for a great multitude has
taken place.  This does not just affect us who carried the message, but this is
also about those who did become saved themselves.  They heard this.  We do not
know what God is doing with them and they are all over the earth, and they are
all outside of the church.  </p>

<p>So He has used this period of time &ndash; 10 months &ndash; to try
these individuals who are His people and to try many who perhaps also heard
outside of the church and yet they never truly became saved.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>You did say that Purim will
be experienced differently by different people in different sections.  Is there
some way to prepare for Purim in how we should be thinking about this; for
example, should we be thinking of the rest for God&rsquo;s people or should we be
thinking of the fulfillment of our inheritance?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We can think of all of these things
because, historically, Purim for the Jews was nothing but good news.  When they
heard that that day was turned for them, there was joy and gladness and great
comfort given to them in all the provinces amongst all of the Jews.  </p>

<p>So this is not a day that an elect looks dreadfully towards,
but it is a day of great hope and expectation and, yes, of entering into the
eternal rest where we receive our inheritance by lot.  That is a good way of
looking at this.  </p>

<p>What I meant by saying that we will be experiencing
different things is that, for example, New Zealand enters into Adar 15, but
other nations may still be on Adar 14.  God could complete it then if He wanted
to and we would all be on Purim.  Adar 14 was a day of rest for 126 provinces,
but it was not a day of rest in Shushan.  So that is the point.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Revelation 14, God
thrusts His sickle into the earth twice, once in verse 16 (without much
explanation) and again a final time in verse 19.  Is this a good picture of
doubling the judgment spiritually?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I have been looking at that, too, and
I have thought the same thing.  But right now, I think that this is something
to continue to look at.  </p>

<p>We read in Revelation 14:14:    </p>

<p class="verse">And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud <i>one
</i>sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his
hand a sharp sickle.  </p>

<p>In both of these instances, there will be a sickle.  Then we
read in Revelation 14:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the
time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;dry&rdquo; or &ldquo;wither&rdquo;
in other places, and so this is not talking about good or ripe fruit, but of a
harvest that is rotten.  It is dry and withered.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 14:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
and the earth was reaped.  </p>

<p>That was the first time.  Then we read in Revelation
14:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the altar, which
had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine
of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.  </p>

<p>I do not have notes on this, but I remember Mr. Camping
talking about this.  Again, this has to do with judgment.  This is not a
positive thing.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Revelation 14:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
the vine of the earth, and cast <i>it </i>into the great winepress of the wrath
of God.  </p>

<p>We read earlier in Revelation 14, &ldquo;The same shall drink of
the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup
of his indignation,&rdquo; and then it mentions torment.  </p>

<p>So I think that this may identify with the double period of
destruction or judgment, the double period of five months; but some of the
language is slightly different.  It says in one place, &ldquo;the harvest of the
earth is ripe&rdquo;; and in another place it says, &ldquo;the clusters of the vine of the
earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.&rdquo;  Yet we do have the action of the Lord
Jesus thrusting in a sickle twice and bringing judgment twice.  So this really
is something to continue to study.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Before May 21, we had the infallible
proof of 722,500 days.  If I remember correctly, it was noted that the factors
were doubled and were shortly going to come to pass.  Is it possible that this
same principle in Genesis applies to the doubling of judgment?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes; I think it does.  You are
referring to April 1, 33 A.D. when Jesus was on the cross through May 21 of
2011.  If we count this space of days, it is 722,500 days, which breaks down to
5x10x17 x 5x10x17.  The number 5 has to do with the atonement, which is when
this began.  Christ was in a tableau making the atonement.  Then the number 10 has
to do with the completion of what is in view; and the number 17 is representing
the completion of the atoning work of Christ bringing all of the elect into a
saving condition and ready for Heaven.  This was accomplished by May 21, and so
it was doubled.  </p>

<p>Now we find that what began on that very day that this
particular proof ended, we began a period of 147 days and then a doubling of
another 147 days.  The number 147 breaks down to 3x7x7 + 3x7x7.   </p>

<p>In the 722,500, it was different because that was a
multiplication of a doubling of numbers and this is an adding of a doubling of
numbers.  In 722,500, the multiplication kept going (5x10x17 x 5x10x17); but
that is not the case here.  It is 3x7x7 + 3x7x7.  But I think that the
principle is the same.  </p>

<p>In this case, we can see what Joseph pointed out when he
said that the dream was one and that it was doubled because &ldquo;God will shortly
bring it to pass.&rdquo;  In that instance, the dream was doubled, but it pointed to
one event.  The doubling of the dream gave indication that it would happen
right away.  Not too long after this, the seven years of plenty began, followed
by seven years of famine.  </p>

<p>Now we have learned that the judgment of five months has
been doubled and that the end of this doubling (the end of the 10 months) will
take place in just a few weeks.  So this is very short and I think that this
principle applies and that &ldquo;God will shortly bring it to pass.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I looked at a couple of
spreadsheets that someone else did and I noticed that the 147 days lined up
perfectly with our Gregorian calendar.  On someone else&rsquo;s spreadsheet, I
noticed that none of it seemed to line up, but I believed that they used the
Julian calendar to line up the first day of Nissan.  If we are saying that
March 7-9<sup>th</sup> is supposed to line up with the feast of Purim, which is
the 12-15<sup>th</sup>, what calendar are we using at this point?  If you look
at the Hebrew calendar, it seems that nothing really lines up very well.  How
do you explain this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>When we are correcting the five
months, we are going back to the Hebrew calendar to do this and we are following
the second date given in the flood account in the book of Genesis; and so the
space of days there is out of our control.  </p>

<p>In the Hebrew calendar, this can change from year to year;
but it so happens that at this particular point, the 17<sup>th</sup> day of 2<sup>nd</sup>
month through the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month is 147 days
in both the Hebrew calendar and in our Gregorian calendar.  I do not know about
the Julian calendar and that calendar is not important.  Then when we double
the 147, it goes to the last day of Purim or March 9<sup>th</sup>, which is
Adar 15.  This works out in the Hebrew calendar and this works out in our
Gregorian calendar.  </p>

<p>But there are different ways of counting.  We can count
inclusively or we can count non-inclusively.  Depending on how we count, we can
change the total.  So you could look at something and it just does not work
out.  Start counting day 1 as May 21 and then go 147 days.  </p>

<p>What was helpful for me to do was to hand draw a calendar
with all of the months leading up to October, and then I counted the days one
by one.  I then checked out various dates with the Hebrew calendar to see how
they fell.  </p>

<p>So the total is accurate.  It is 147 if you start counting
with May 21; that is, May 21 is day one.  For May of 2011, you would get 11
days total rather than 10.  You get 10 if you do not start counting on May 21. 
</p>

<p>So if you count May 21, and we should because that was the
17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, then we come to October 14.  October
14 is Tishri 16; but in the evening, it turns to Tishri 17.  So we have reached
the date given in Genesis, which is 147 days.  </p>

<p>Then on October 15, that is Tishri 17 and Tishri 18.  Once
again, we have a starting point that is in line with the date given in
Genesis.  We count 147 and it comes to Adar 15 or March 9.  </p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>Continued from previous
question</i>):  </b>Are we completely throwing out October 21<sup>st</sup> as a
date and instead using October 15<sup>th</sup> as the date?  If I am
understanding this correctly, October 21<sup>st</sup> was not a date for us and
that it was just something that was only five months in our calendar with our
understanding of the 153 days.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Right.  We were thinking that October
21 was the last day because that was the last day of the feast of tabernacles. 
</p>

<p>Why was that supposed to be the day?  It was because that
was the day that was listed as the last day, the day for the resurrection.  It
was to be the end of all things.  That phrase &ldquo;last day&rdquo; is used eight times,
and so it was very attractive and very appealing to say that that would be the
day, but that was not the last day.  It was not the day of the resurrection and
it was not the end of the world.  Therefore, that assumption was wrong.  </p>

<p>If we went back and we followed Genesis and nothing came of
it, I would not say that we had any basis for making a change.  But when we go
back and then we learn that the language of doubling the torment is in the
Bible, and it so happens that when we do double it, it lands on the last day of
the feast of Purim, the feast that has come so much into view, then I think that
this is pretty clear and that this is all legitimate.  </p>

<p>This is Biblical.  We are now sticking with two dates from
the Genesis account.  Once we do, then we have a lot of verses.  All of
Revelation 9 now makes sense &ndash; the whole chapter.  After October 21, it just
ceased to make sense.   </p>

<p>People were rightly asking, &ldquo;What happens now?  There was
five months of torment.  October 21 should have been the end and we have passed
this.  Is there still torment?  Are men still seeking death and not able to
find it?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>All of these things are answered because we now see that
what was true of the five months is true of ten months.  All of the verses now
have an explanation.  </p>

<p>This is how we can know that we are on the right track.  We
did not pull Tishri 17 out of a hat.  It came from Genesis in the very same
account.  If we had just pulled this out of the blue from some obscure timeline
from somewhere and said, &ldquo;Hey, what if we do this,&rdquo; then this would not be
legitimate.  But we are going to the very account itself and it is there.  Once
we do this, we find that doubling it just so happens &ndash; and what are the odds of
this &ndash; this just so happens to land on Purim.  </p>

<p>We did not come up with Revelation 18:6 either where God
stresses three times in one verse &ldquo;double unto her double&hellip;fill to her double.&rdquo; 
Then He says in the next verse, &ldquo;so much torment and sorrow give her.&rdquo;  I think
that it really is quite clear what God has done.   </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I sent you that spreadsheet not
too long ago lining up the feast of Purim to that calendar in Esther with our
own calendar.  What you are saying is absolutely correct.  If you take away the
top starting from 2/17 and you take out all of the lines and you count along
the side of the lines and rows, you come right to 3/9 of our calendar, which is
294 days.  The feast of Purim is 2/15.  It all lines up and I just did not
understand why anybody would want to use the Julian calendar because it never
seemed to line up with anything.  But it looks like 2/17 to 12/15 is conclusive.
 To the feast of Purim, it is exactly 294 days.  But thank you for your answer
and for the good work out there.  </p>
