<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Luke
21:25?  It feels to a lot of the believers that we are in the great tribulation
today because of the difficulties that we are having, but we know that this is
not true.  This word for &ldquo;perplexity&rdquo; is only used here, but its root word
comes from a word that means &ldquo;to doubt.&rdquo;  We know that the tribulation is over,
but this language of &ldquo;distress of nations, with perplexity&rdquo; tells us, in a
sense, that we are in a time of perplexity, of doubting, a time that is like
the tribulation.  Can you see where I am going with this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Luke 21:25 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the
waves roaring;  </p>

<p>You are making some good points.  We know that this would be
immediately after the tribulation.  Even though it does not say this here, it
pinpoints the time in Matthew 24:29.  So this is not during the great
tribulation.  It is &ldquo;immediately after,&rdquo; and there is &ldquo;distress of nations.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;distress&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;anguish of heart&rdquo; in
2 Corinthians 2:4; and you are right about the word &ldquo;perplexity.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Perplexity&rdquo;
is Strong&rsquo;s #640 and it is related to #639, which is translated as &ldquo;doubting&rdquo;
in John 13:22 where the disciples were &ldquo;doubting of whom he spake&rdquo;; and so this
has to do with confusion, which brings trouble of mind or anguish of heart.  </p>

<p>Also, we cannot forget the very last part of Luke 21:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the sea and the waves roaring;  </p>

<p>This is very important information, because what does this
mean?  If we see a sea with its waves roaring, is that calm water?  No.  How
would we describe this?  It would be a &ldquo;troubled sea.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us in Isaiah 57:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wicked <i>are </i>like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<i> There is </i>no peace, saith my
God, to the wicked.</p>

<p>Again, when we look at the evidence and compare Scripture
with Scripture, which is all that we are doing, it is telling us that the
wicked, the unsaved people of the world, have no rest.  </p>

<p>What this verse is teaching is that there is no salvation. 
It is a matter of placing this verse.  </p>

<p>The question comes down to whether or not we are in the
great tribulation.  Has it ended?  If it has ended, these verses take effect. 
If it is continuing on, then it is not time yet.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 14, we also read of a lack of rest.  In
Revelation 14:11, it is speaking of Judgment Day.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and
whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.  </p>

<p>Mr. Camping has pointed out that &ldquo;day and night&rdquo; is a time
reference.  This, of course, was applied during the time of the five months of
torment.  </p>

<p>The fact is that here is a reference to God judging sinners,
and what is part of this judgment said to be?  It is that they &ldquo;have no rest.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>This fits perfectly with the statement in Luke 21:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the sea and the waves roaring;  </p>

<p>So &ldquo;the wicked <i>are </i>like the troubled sea&rdquo; who &ldquo;have
no rest.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In other words, if the great tribulation ended, the language
of the sun being darkened, the powers of the heavens being shaken, and the sea
and the waves roaring indicates that there is no salvation available, that it
is the judgment of God upon the world, and that it would be here.  </p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (<i>Continued from previous
question</i>):  </b>Do you think that the language of &ldquo;the sea and the waves roaring&rdquo;
could also be pointing to the height of evil and of the false gospels, as well
as the wickedness of man, getting to its highest strength?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>In Jude 1:13, where it is speaking of
false prophets, it says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame&hellip;   </p>

<p>So, yes, it has that element to it; but more than that, this
is picturing a &ldquo;troubled sea.&rdquo;  Of course, the false prophets are also wicked
and unsaved; but here, in this context, I think that it is pointing to all of
the wicked, to all of the unsaved people.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Lastly, Ezekiel 26:18 does link
to this as it says, &ldquo;In the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that <i>are </i>in
the sea shall be troubled.&rdquo;  So this might be a time reference for you to look
at at some point.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  We read in Ezekiel 26:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the
isles that <i>are </i>in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.  </p>

<p>This is something to look at.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>I heard you say last week
that we would start at 11 A.M. EST.  Are we going to stay with 12 Noon EST for a starting time for the fellowship?  Also, the Lord said in Matthew not to
call anyone a fool.  Is this to be taken literally?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>As far as the start time, I think that
I did say that and I apologize.  What we need to do is announce this and I
failed to do this, so this was why we went back to the original starting time. 
We announce this in certain groups and we would not want someone showing up at 12 Noon because they had not received this announcement, so this was why we continued
today at this time.  You can look for an announcement.  If you do not see an
announcement, the starting time will continue to be 12 Noon EST until we can send out that announcement.  </p>

<p>As far as the fool, it says in Matthew 5:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to
his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say,
Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  </p>

<p>Yes.  God is giving laws.  The transgression of any law does
what to us?  It brings us in danger of destruction.  The transgression of the
law of God brings the wrath of God upon us, whether it be a little lie, whether
it be a curse, whether it be anger in our hearts, whether it be hatred to our
brother, and so forth.  We would think that it is nothing.  We do not think
that it is worthy of any punishment, and yet God continually teaches total
perfection.  </p>

<p>Remember how Matthew 5:48 concluded today:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect.  </p>

<p>If we have any imperfection regarding the law of God (in
other words, sin), we are guilty.  We are guilty of all and subject to &ldquo;hell fire,&rdquo;
a phrase that the Bible uses to refer to destruction, to death, and to complete
annihilation.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In 1Peter 3:19, is the Bible teaching us in this verse that people are spirits?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in 1Peter 3:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened [<i>brought to life</i>] by the Spirit:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By which&rdquo; in verse 19 is referring back to the Spirit.  1Peter
 3:19 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;  </p>

<p>Who went?  Christ went by the Spirit of God and preached.  Then
verse 20 tells us that it was during the construction of the ark that this took
place.  </p>

<p>How did Christ, by the Sprit, preach to &ldquo;spirits in
prison&rdquo;?  He did this through Noah, just as God preaches to the world through
His people at any time.  He used Noah to build the ark, He used Noah to warn
the world, and it was through this that He preached.  This is why Noah is
called &ldquo;a preacher of righteousness&rdquo; or a preacher of Christ.  </p>

<p>Did Noah preach to &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo;?  Yes; he preached to
the souls of men, and those men were in the spiritual dungeons of sin, taken
captive by sin and by Satan.  Those were the ones who were preached to in the
days leading up to the flood.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Would you please look at
Luke 21:28?  Is &ldquo;lift up your heads&rdquo; to be taken literally?  If not literally,
what might this mean spiritually?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Luke 21:26:    </p>

<p class="verse">Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Notice that it is not there yet.  They are looking on that
which is coming.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.  </p>

<p>Again, here is that phrase that we also found in Matthew
24:29.  </p>

<p>It continues in Luke 21:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory.  </p>

<p><i>Dunamis</i> has other aspects to it.  It describes many
things about God.  For instance, it tells us in 1<sup>st</sup> Peter that we
are &ldquo;kept by the <span class="underline">power</span> of God.&rdquo;  When Christ comes, He is also coming
with <i>dunamis</i>.  </p>

<p>It continues in Luke 21:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.   </p>

<p>What redemption is this speaking of?  Romans 8:23 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And not only <i>they, </i>but ourselves also, which have the
firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
for the adoption, <i>to wit, </i>the redemption of our body.  </p>

<p>This is indicating that the children of God have the earnest
of the Spirit, the down payment, but this is only to tell them that the promise
will come to pass.  </p>

<p>With God indicating that there are signs in the sun, in the
moon, and in the stars, and that this all that took place immediately after the
tribulation, that this is actually an indicator or a sign that the redemption
of the body will soon be here.  </p>

<p>In other words, let us say that the great tribulation ended
on May 21.  For now, I think that it did, but I really am trying to look at
everything and at the possibility that it did not.  I do not see any evidence
that it did not.  All I see is evidence that it absolutely did.  But let us say
that the great tribulation ended and that, spiritually, the light of the Gospel
went out in this world, and that the powers of heaven were shaken.  </p>

<p>These are signs of the coming of the Son of Man, and so God
is indicating here in Luke 21:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up&hellip;  </p>

<p>But this is not literal.  We are not to walk around with our
heads up.  We are to look up in expectation of Christ&rsquo;s coming, as it says in
Acts 1:9-10 when Jesus was taken away:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked
stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white
apparel;</p>

<p>Then it says in the next verse that He will &ldquo;come in like
manner.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we see this phrase here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they looked stedfastly toward heaven&hellip;  </p>

<p>Spiritually, where do we look when we are looking &ldquo;stedfastly
toward heaven&rdquo;?  We look in the Bible.  We are to look &ldquo;stedfastly toward
heaven&rdquo; in the Scriptures at this time because Christ will soon be here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could Luke 11:24 be
understood as follows?  The &ldquo;unclean spirit&rdquo; is a representation of Satan, and
he &ldquo;walketh through dry places.&rdquo;  For example, the &ldquo;dry places&rdquo; are without
water, water being a representation of the true Gospel.  He is &ldquo;seeking rest&rdquo;
and will not find this rest because this rest is reserved only for God&rsquo;s people
through Jesus Christ, as in Matthew 11:29; whereas Revelation 14:11 indicates that those who &ldquo;worship the beast [<i>Satan</i>] and his image&rdquo; will not
have rest.  Could you explain this, please?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It says in Luke 11:24-26:    </p>

<p class="verse">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my
house whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth <i>it </i>swept and
garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh <i>to him </i>seven other spirits more
wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last <i>state </i>of
that man is worse than the first.  </p>

<p>God views or takes individuals at their word who say that
they are saved.  We can find evidence of this in the Bible.  </p>

<p>For instance, we see this in the parable of the man who was
forgiven a great debt.  In that parable, the man was forgiven a great debt goes
to another person who owes him a very little bit, especially in comparison to
this man&rsquo;s great debt, and yet he takes that person by the throat.  At the end,
after this is made known to the one who had forgiven him the great debt, the
Bible says that he &ldquo;delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all
that was due unto him,&rdquo; indicating that he was under the judgment of God.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, we know that God never forgives sins and then
takes away that initial forgiveness of sins from someone who does not forgive
another.  No; once saved, always saved.  But the way this works out with the
Gospel is that many are called.  </p>

<p>So there are those who say that they are a child of God,
they say that they are a true believer, but God sees how they live, whether or
not they live accordingly.  This is as though &ldquo;the unclean spirit is gone out
of a man,&rdquo; but, however, the truth is that this person never became saved.  </p>

<p>So even though someone might clean up their life a little
bit, what happens is that the unclean spirit comes back.  Since that person did
not have the Holy Spirit indwelling him, this is why it says in Luke 11:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he cometh, he findeth <i>it </i>swept and garnished.  </p>

<p>There is no one inhabiting that dwelling.  The Holy Spirit
is not there, and so then he, the unclean spirit, is free to come back and more
evil accompanies him.  </p>

<p>This is how it is with men.  This is how it is especially
with those who profess to be Christians.  There is nothing that truly took
place inwardly in their hearts, and so, ultimately, they end up worse than
ever.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
