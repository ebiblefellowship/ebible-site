  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">01:03</span> In Esther 9:19 and 22, would God allow us to translate &ldquo;good&rdquo; day as &ldquo;best&rdquo; day, because sometimes &ldquo;good&rdquo; (Strong&rsquo;s #2896) is translated as &ldquo;best&rdquo;?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">06:02</span> Last Sunday, you mentioned billboards in regards to March being the potential end of the world.  Can you elaborate on this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">10:03</span> How much of the information that you are teaching today is new as being revealed in our day versus something that was taught previously by Harold Camping?  Also, as far as the major points along the timeline of history, everything seems to be in the book of Esther but the Feast of Tabernacles.  Does it cause any concern that this important piece of the timeline is absent, or do you actually see how it fits in?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">18:34</span> I have heard some critical comments along the line of it not making any sense that God would reveal this to just one man, but it just so happens that I came to the same conclusion of the 17th day of the 2nd month being in Esther independent of your messages.  I am sure that others are seeing this, too.  What is important is that this is coming from the Word of God.  It is not important who learned this first.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:53</span> Can you please explain the spiritual significance of the hanging of Haman&rsquo;s ten sons?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:07</span> In the last half of Hebrews 9:26, God says that &ldquo;now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin.&rdquo;  Is this showing us that this is in our generation?  At what point in the Biblical timeline is God referring to?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:06</span> In relation to Esther 8:17, could you talk about what is going on when the people in the provinces became Jews?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">42:09</span> I used to share salvation truths up until October 21.  Since then, it does not come out of my mouth; yet when I see people in heartache, in loneliness, in physical pain and in need of all kinds, I tell them that God is good to all people and that they should read the Bible in order to be encouraged by God&rsquo;s goodness, but I do not tell them to do this unto salvation.  Am I correct in this expression of help?  </li>
  </ol>
