  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">00:13</span> Could you be omitting anything in the Bible that could relate to the end that has not been included in everything that came up to May 21st and October 21st?  Are there not other books in the Bible with regard to the end that the Lord might be opening up at this time?  Also, if Purim comes and nothing happens, from your perspective, what would this mean for you personally?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">12:37</span> Could you read and comment on Jeremiah 7:33-34 and 8:1-3?  I know that Mr. Camping used these verses regarding the rapture and the opening up of the graves on the last day.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">22:03</span> Could you read Daniel 12:10?  When we go to Judges 20, God seems to have set a precedent there on His testing program.  Would their testing program compare to Judgment Day and would what we have gone through compare to three times of deliverance?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:43</span> Do you have any understanding of Luke 12:36?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">30:27</span> (Comment is made on the billboard in Philadelphia and the various web links to this information.)  Could you compare Esther 7:8 with Revelation 2:22?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:48</span> Could you compare Jonah 4:11 with Genesis 47:16?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:52</span> Could you look at Genesis 5:23 and Genesis 8:14?  Is the number 365 a spiritual number for the rapture or does it just symbolize the end of a year?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">50:12</span> In 1st Samuel 3, God calls Samuel three times during the night, but Samuel is mistaken and thinks that Eli is calling him.  Could this be a picture of the true believers as we have heard the calling of God three times &ndash; September 1994, May 2011, and October 2011?  </li>
  </ol>
