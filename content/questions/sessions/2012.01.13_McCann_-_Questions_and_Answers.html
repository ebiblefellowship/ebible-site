  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">07:11</span> Since the Bible tells us in regards to the end times that they will be as the days of Noah and Lot, how were you led to search Esther for the information of the time of Christ&rsquo;s return?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">22:35</span> Regarding the captives and the oppressors in Isaiah 14:1-3, can you compare this with what we read in Esther where the Jews killed their enemies instead of being killed themselves?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:45</span> Regarding Esther 8:1-2, is this a picture of the believers being given back their inheritance?  If so, did this happen on May 21, 2011?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">41:10</span> Could you set the context of Isaiah 24:19-22?  Please try to explain the last part of verse 22.    </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:02</span> I heard recently that some of the Esther studies had been sent to Mr. Camping.  I was just wondering whether or not you have had a response from him?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">44:25</span> People are using Exodus 32:1-6 and Galatians 4:9-10 to say that we are not to set a date.  What do you know about this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">51:47</span> (Continued from Question #6):  The previous questioner forgot to mention that date setting was explained to be an idol, so those verses were being used to justify that.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">53:27</span> Have we been able to tie Noah&rsquo;s timeline to the Esther timeline?  </li>
  </ol>
