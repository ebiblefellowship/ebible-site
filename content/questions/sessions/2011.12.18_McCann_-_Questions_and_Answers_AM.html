  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">09:52</span> In Genesis 8, God established that Noah was 601 years old by the time that he came out of the ark and that the earth was dried up on the 27th day of the 2nd month.  This converts to May 19, 2012 on our calendar.  Have you studied this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">14:21</span> Please elaborate on Hebrews 12:15-17.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">21:39</span> In Esther 1 and Genesis 23, we find the number 127; but in the Hebrew, these are written as three separate numbers.  Should we look at them as 100, 20, and 7 individually for spiritual meaning in these chapters?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:40</span> After reading Esther 9, I saw where the Jews were to be relieved from the wicked plan of Haman on the 13th day of the 12th month.  This appears to be around March 7th through 9th.  I know that this may be presumptuous, but I went ahead and requested a couple of days off from work in March because I will never stop looking for that day, just as the Lord says that we should continue to look.  Have you seen anything in Esther 9?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:00</span> Did God change His name from &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; to &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; or did He just assign Himself another name?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">29:53</span> In relation to Luke 19:11, can we relate this to post May 21?  If so, can we then relate the specific events and instructions in the &ldquo;occupy till I come&rdquo; parable to how we should be behaving at this time?  </li>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>To begin with, people are saying this
again.  People are saying that we cannot know the day or hour, which is not
new.  There is no new revelation being made as far as that statement goes.  </p>

<p>Have we heard this before?  How often have we heard this? 
How much have we heard this?  Are we to think that, suddenly, now at this time,
after the five months have passed, this is a new revelation and that no man now
can know the day or hour?  </p>

<p>No; God is not doing this at all.  This is just coming from
those who are possibly kind of weary and those who may be tired because they
believed that the Bible taught that they could know the time.  Things did not
work out the way that they thought; and so, now, they have had enough and they
want to just join forces with everyone else, &ldquo;Hey; I am right with you.  The
Bible says that no man knows.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, the Bible does say, &ldquo;Of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>.&rdquo; 
But we have to look at this in the light of the whole Bible.  When we do, we
find that the other information is still there.  We find that God, before He
destroyed the world with a flood, told Noah about it beforehand.  We find that
God, before He destroyed Sodom, told Lot all about it beforehand so that he
could get out of the city.  We find that God, before He said that He would
destroy Nineveh, told Jonah to warn the people.  </p>

<p>We have all of the other verses like, &ldquo;Surely the Lord GOD
will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets&rdquo;
and &ldquo;A wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.&rdquo;  We could go on
with many more; but the response is, &ldquo;Yes; but it did not happen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>By God&rsquo;s grace, I had the opportunity of being interviewed
many, many times on the radio leading up to May 21, 2011.  This was a common statement that the interviewer on the radio station would make.  Callers would
sometimes have the opportunity to call and ask me questions and they would say
the same thing, again and again, without fail.  &ldquo;Look; there have been a lot of
predictions,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;and none of them ever happened in the past.&rdquo; 
They would just pick some number like &ldquo;hundreds of predictions,&rdquo; when nobody
really knows; and so they would insist, &ldquo;None of these predictions ever came to
pass.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Many of these stations were secular, and so it occurred to
me, &ldquo;Let me use a secular analogy that they can understand.  Let me use an
earthly illustration that they will be able to get.&rdquo;  So I used the
illustration of flight and air travel.  </p>

<p>How often through the history of man did people try to fly
and fail?  Therefore, as a result, how often did people say, &ldquo;You cannot do
it.  You will never be able to fly&rdquo;?  They would say, &ldquo;In fact, it is
absolutely not possible to fly.&rdquo;  And all of history had proven that statement
true up until the point that they made it.  </p>

<p>Every time there would be an additional attempt and failure,
this reinforced this idea, &ldquo;We know that you cannot fly because this is an
impossibility.  If you try, you are going to end up at the bottom of the
gully.  Your wings are going to be broken.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Yet what if people believed this?  What if they finally
said, &ldquo;You know what?  It is true.  Hundreds of years have passed and the
attempts have gotten more and more intense.  After all, look at that last one! 
That guy ended up at the bottom of the rocks.  You know what?  These people are
right.  It is an impossibility to fly.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What if they had believed this?  Well, it would be a little
harder traveling this Christmas season, would it not?  It would be very hard to
travel at this time.  </p>

<p>God is in control of these things, too, and He put this in
the hearts and minds of certain individuals, &ldquo;I do not care what people think. 
I think that it is impossible.&rdquo;  They worked hard.  God, of course, was in
control of all of the technological increases that we have been blessed with
and He opened up their understanding to tweak things a little here and to tweak
things a little there.  The next thing you know, they were taking flight.  </p>

<p>It was a little hop and a skip at first.  Then they could
fly some distance.  Now, of course, we can fly to the moon.  We can fly to Mars
with satellites.  We can go pretty far from just 150 years ago or maybe a
little bit longer when men would say, &ldquo;It is an absolute impossibility to get
up there into the sky.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make was that we recognize it on
an earthly level.  This is true for many things.  There is always trial and
error.  A success or finding the solution or finding the cure to a disease is
full of trial and error.  It is only when someone is willing to continue that
they finally come to the cure for this disease or that disease or there is an
invention made that was seemingly not possible before.  </p>

<p>Nothing in the Bible has changed and it is a set date that
will not move.  It has never moved; it is unmovable.  The idea that God changes
time regarding the end of the world is ridiculous.  He knows the end from the
beginning and He picked a certain date.  </p>

<p>We were incorrect in thinking that this date was October 21, 2011, as far as the very end of time.  We were correct that May 21, 2011 was Judgment Day.  We were correct that there was a very important five-month
period that did end on October 21, and we are not outside of the Bible&rsquo;s
calendar at this time.  </p>

<p>I am not going to present this today; but within the next
three to four weeks, we will find that the Bible locks in May 21, 2011 as the day of judgment and that it gives us a date for Judgment Day, the end of days.  </p>

<p>This is coming from the Bible.  This is from God&rsquo;s calendar,
and this is how He can say, &ldquo;Though I tarry,&rdquo; because He is the One who laid
things all out so that we would come to the conclusion that it would be October
21, &ldquo;I will not tarry&rdquo;; because that set date that has always been there is
still there.  </p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>I started reading again in
Genesis 7:11.  I kept reading and got up to the eighth chapter.  Lo and behold,
as I began to read Genesis 8:13, God very clearly said that Noah was 601 years
old, not 600.  So he was in the ark for over a year and that was the first day
of the first month.  Then, lo and behold, I read the next verse and it said
that the earth was dried up on the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, the 27<sup>th</sup>
day.  This shifts to a day in 2012, if we follow the same logic and convert our
calendar back to the Biblical calendar.  This comes out to be the 19<sup>th</sup>
day of the 5<sup>th</sup> month on our calendar of May 2012.  This is just the
straight math of saying what God says, which was that Noah was in the ark for a
year.  He was trying to establish that Noah was another year older and he still
had not come out of that ark, but he did on the 27<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month of the Biblical calendar.  When you go to a computer and convert it, it
gives the date of May the 19<sup>th</sup>.  Have you studied this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I appreciate those verses and I will
try to address this.  Those verses have been presented through emails.  Let me
say that I do not think that that is the day.  </p>

<p>When we read that they came out of the ark on the 27<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, that actually is about one year later, even
though it would apparently be ten days beyond.  This is because we have to keep
in mind that the Hebrew calendar was lunar.  This means that they would have
one month of 29 days and the next month of 30 days.  If you follow this for
twelve months, you will end up with only 354 days.  </p>

<p>So even though this is ten days beyond the 17<sup>th</sup> day
when Noah went into the ark, since it says that he came out on the 27<sup>th</sup>,
when you relate this to the year that God has established, which is 365.2422
days, then it comes out to be almost exactly one year that he was in the ark. 
Mike Cook did a study on this a couple of years ago.  </p>

<p>In looking at the book of Esther, and I will try to layout
some things today during the study, I see a very clear timeline and date.  You
are right, though.  This is coming from the Bible and not from any other
source; and so this had to be looked at as a possibility, but I do not think
that this is it. </p>

<p>In regards to this since October 21 (just like after May
21), people have thought about three and a half days or forty days or Christmas
or December 27<sup>th</sup>; but no.  Anything that is trying to build onto
October 21 or add onto October 21, we can be sure that it will be wrong.  This
is not what God is doing at all.  We will get into the reasons for why I think
this later.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Please elaborate on Hebrews
12:15-17.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Hebrews 12:14-17:    </p>

<p class="verse">Follow peace with all <i>men, </i>and holiness, without which no
man shall see the Lord: Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of
God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble <i>you, </i>and thereby
many be defiled; Lest there <i>be </i>any fornicator, or profane person, as
Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that
afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he
found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  </p>

<p>Verse 15 has a good admonition for all of us regarding the
possibility of a &ldquo;root of bitterness springing up&rdquo; and troubling us and
defiling us.  </p>

<p>First of all, this is an admonition to husbands.  Do you
remember what God said, &ldquo;Husbands, love <i>your </i>wives, and be not bitter
against them.&rdquo;  Why?  This is because, sometimes, a wife might nag.  Normally,
the husband takes it and takes it and gets quiet, but he struggles inside and
there can be bitterness that develops.  </p>

<p>This is why God warns the husband to watch out for this and
to not allow this.  If your wife does something that is wrong towards you, forgive. 
This is where love comes in, &ldquo;Husbands, love <i>your </i>wives, and be not
bitter against them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what bitterness is a lot of times.  It is
internalizing something and dwelling on it.  It is kind of meditating on an
evil thing, but the Bible tells us to meditate on the Word of God.  That is
where our minds should be.  But with bitterness, we mediate on somebody who
hurt us or something that we feel was done unjustly to us.  We dwell on that
and we start getting angry and bitter inside.  </p>

<p>I think some people have done this maybe in regards to the
money and the time that they spent in getting out the Gospel leading up to May
21.  Since this did not happen as planned, they are getting bitter.  You can
hear them say things like, &ldquo;I spent thousands of dollars going on trips.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>First of all, nobody made anyone do any of these things. 
That was all their own doing.  They also say things like, &ldquo;I did not focus on
other things.  I did not buy this other thing that I wanted.  I took funds that
I could have used for some other things and used that to get the Gospel out.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now that it is after that day and things did not turn out,
as they look back, they could be getting angry, which leads to bitterness.  But
we have to remember that if we had an opportunity to take up our cross and
follow Christ and use our time and our money and our resources in order to get
the Gospel out to people to warn them, this was exactly what we should have
been doing all along anyway.  </p>

<p>Did we do anything special?  Does God not say that we are to
sacrifice our whole lives and that we are to give Him everything that we have? 
What does it say in Romans 12?  We read in Romans 12:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <i>which
is</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then does this say that this is a tremendously great and
wonderful thing that we are doing?  No; this does not say that.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>which is </i>your reasonable service.  </p>

<p>This is our &ldquo;reasonable service.&rdquo;  It is our duty and this
applies throughout all of history.  This applies to any time, to any reader who
would read this throughout the centuries.  Our reasonable duty is to give up
our lives and to sacrifice ourselves.  </p>

<p>Some people, you see, were prompted to do something that they
would not normally have done, but they thought that Christ was coming.  Some
were true believers and had no problem with these things.  They look back and
are thankful that they had the opportunity to see what it was like to live in a
wholehearted way for Christ.  But some who look back are now sorry that they
gave up their time and their money, and so forth, and they can be getting
bitter about this.  </p>

<p>So God is warning us to be careful and to watch out for
this, and this has to do with the type of ground that the seed falls on in the
parable of the sowing of the seed.  We read about the parable of the sower in
Matthew 13.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>In Esther 1 and Genesis 23,
we find the number 127; but in the Hebrew, these are written as three separate
numbers.  Should we look at them as 100, 20, and 7 individually for spiritual
meaning in these chapters?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; we should not do this.  This is
just how God wrote this.  This is how He writes out numbers.  Sometimes we read
something like &ldquo;threescore and ten&rdquo; where things seem to be broken down into
different numbers.  But when God speaks of 127, we get that number of 127.  </p>

<p>What we can do, when possible, is to then break down that
number by dividing it to see if it divides by 2 or 3 or 4, or by whatever
number.  But 127 does not divide; it stands alone and cannot be broken down
into any smaller numbers.  </p>

<p>As far as the number 127, we just look at how it is used in
the book of Esther or wherever it is found.  In this case, we find it also in
Genesis in association with Sarah and we see that it has to do with all of the
elect, because Sarah is &ldquo;the mother of us all,&rdquo; as it says in Galatians, or all
of the true believers.  And we find this number in relation to &ldquo;all the
provinces,&rdquo; which were 127.  </p>

<p>So, basically, when we find, again and again, in the book of
Esther that the decree of the king is being sent to all 127 provinces, this
means all of the world.  When the Jews in all 127 provinces, for instance, hear
that there is a set day of judgment for them in which they are to be killed and
all of the Jews begin to mourn in all of the provinces, that is telling us that
there is some sort of announcement that has been made to the world in which all
of the elect hear it and respond.  </p>

<p>So we are helped with this identification with Sarah and
with the number of provinces.  They are tying together the elect who are found
in all of the world, as Ahasuerus is a picture of God who reigns over the Kingdom
 of God; and so all of these provinces typify His kingdom, especially in this
world.     </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I know that you are still
in the book of Esther; but because of what I read in Esther 9, I know that this
may be presumptuous, but I went ahead and requested a couple of days off from
work in March.  After reading Esther 9, I saw where the Jews were to be
relieved from the wicked plan of Haman on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup>
month.  I also went to the computer and tried to figure out that time on the
Biblical calendar.  This appears to be around March 7<sup>th</sup> through 9<sup>th</sup>. 
I do not know if you are there yet, but I know that we will know.  I will never
stop looking for that day, just as the Lord says that we should continue to
look.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>That will be the time of the Feast of
Purim; but we cannot just say this.  This is the problem with many studies that
are out there.  People say things like, &ldquo;Christ did not come, but it is the
7,000<sup>th</sup> year from the flood.  We are still within that 7,000<sup>th</sup>
year, so let us pick the Passover.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We cannot just pick a day.  It has to be God who picks it. 
It has to be God who locks it in, and I think that He has.  </p>

<p>We are going to talk about the Feast of Purim in the study
today, Lord willing.  I am actually going to jump ahead to chapter 9 today in
the book of Esther.  We will see a little later as to why chapter 9 is so
interesting.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I remember Brother Camping
saying that God has many names.  He assigned Himself many names, like &ldquo;lily of
the valleys&rdquo; or &ldquo;bright and morning star&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;  From my understanding, the
name &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; is the timeline name that God incarnated.  When He assigned to
Abraham another name, from Abram to Abraham, would you say that He changed his
name or that He assigned him another name?  So did God change His name from
&ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; to &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; or did He just assign Himself another name?  &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; is
not mentioned in the New Testament.  What is mentioned is &ldquo;the Father.&rdquo;  Can we
say that &ldquo;the Father&rdquo; is &ldquo;Jehovah the Spirit&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; is just the
timeline name when He was incarnated, but that they are both the same?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I would just say that He has many
names and that each name teaches us something about God Himself.  For instance,
it says in Isaiah that they shall &ldquo;call his name Immanuel.&rdquo;  And it says in
Matthew 1:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.  </p>

<p>Then we also read in Matthew 1:23:    </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God
with us.  </p>

<p>So He is &ldquo;Emmanuel.&rdquo;  He is also &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo;  He is also
&ldquo;Jehovah,&rdquo; because Isaiah 43 tells us, &ldquo;I, <i>even </i>I, <i>am </i>JEHOVAH;
and beside me <i>there is </i>no saviour.&rdquo;  I would not say that He changed His
name, but that God has given Himself many names.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please read Luke 19:11-15. 
I believe that verses 11, 12, and 15 are teaching one and the same.  But
because verse 11 says that Jesus was &ldquo;nigh to Jerusalem&rdquo; and because the
disciples thought that the Kingdom of God &ldquo;should immediately appear,&rdquo; can we
relate this to post May 21?  If so, can we then relate the specific events and
instructions in the &ldquo;occupy till I come&rdquo; parable to how we should be behaving
at this time?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Luke 19:11-15:    </p>

<p class="verse">And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God
should immediately appear. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a
far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And he called his
ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I
come. But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will
not have this <i>man </i>to reign over us. And it came to pass, that when he
was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to
be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much
every man had gained by trading.  </p>

<p>I have not looked at verse 11 that closely, so I cannot
really comment on which time period it is really focused on.  I do know that
the verse that says &ldquo;occupy till I come&rdquo; applies to us.  Of course, the
question is how do we occupy?  </p>

<p>We occupy by doing the will of God, whatever the will of God
is.  This is how believers occupy.  </p>

<p>We are thinking, and Lord willing this might happen, of
developing some information that is primarily from the book of Esther and
putting together a booklet or a tract and putting this on our website.  This
will be done in humility.  We may say something like &ldquo;Will Christ return&rdquo; on
such-and-such a date &ldquo;during the Feast of Purim?&rdquo;  I do not know exactly how
this will be worded.  We will have this in big bold letters on the website with
a link to the studies.  This information will go out and people will be able to
read it, and this is a form of occupying.  </p>

<p>Let us say that God was still saving, which I do not really
believe that He is, but let us say that He was.  Did the fact that believers
did not tell people this for five months prevent God from saving anyone during
that five months?  Would it or could it?  No.  How does God save?  He saves
through His Word.  </p>

<p>Some people have always been under the mistaken idea that
you have to preach Christ and Him crucified.  By that, they mean that you have
to keep talking about the cross.  But Christ is the Word.  He is the whole
Bible; and what we have to do is to just teach truth.  This is all that we have
ever had to do.  </p>

<p>We do not have to specifically talk about any aspect of
salvation in order for God to save if He were saving.  God can save with a
word.  He can save with a genealogy.  He does not specifically need people to
say that He is saving.  </p>

<p>But I think that we are going to occupy in this manner in
the coming days and the reason is coming from the Bible.  This is because in
the book of Esther, there is a spiritual chronology.  It starts with Vashti who
represents Israel.  It moves on to the virgins who were gathered in, which
typify the New Testament church.  Right in order, it goes to the two
doorkeepers who were killed, which represented the end of the church age.  Then
it goes in order to the advancement of Haman, which typifies Satan&rsquo;s loosing at
the time of the great tribulation.  It goes into May 21 and dwells there for
over three chapters in the book of Esther.  Then it goes into post-May 21
during the last couple of chapters.  </p>

<p>So the book of Esther gives us this chronology.  Within this
chronology, the Word is sent out again.  This is because once Haman is killed,
all of the Jews in all of the provinces are notified.  All of the posts are
sent out again.  The only setting for that sending out the Word again is after
May 21.  And so for this reason, which is a Biblical reason that is coming from
God, we will want to notify people about this information.  </p>

<p>The world heard about May 21.  In a certain sense, they
heard about October 21.  No one has heard about Purim at all.  </p>

<p>We are going to have to stop here and close with a word of
prayer.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank You for Your grace. 
Father, we thank You for the Bible, which is a light in the darkness.  Father,
we pray that You would grant us wisdom.  We have no wisdom of ourselves, but we
do ask that You would shine the light on the path that we are to go.  Father, we
ask, once again, that You would bless Your Word that we had an opportunity to
read.  Help us to meditate on these things, on the Bible, and not to dwell on
things that would make us bitter.  Help us to forget the past, &ldquo;forgetting
those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before.&rdquo;  Help us to &ldquo;press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;  Father, we ask that You would be with us.  We pray
this in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
