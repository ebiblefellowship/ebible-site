  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">01:56</span> In Esther 5:14, who are Zeresh and Haman&rsquo;s friends a spiritual picture of, and why did Haman not come up with the idea to kill Mordecai by hanging him?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">08:05</span> (Continued from Question #1):  Was the preparation of Haman&rsquo;s demise God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose for this happening?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">09:16</span> Can you take a look at Luke 11:5-8 please?  Could these verses apply to the young children who were forced to remain in the churches by their parents up to and after May 21?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">14:36</span> Do you think that Purim might be strictly a spiritual event like May and October?  If not, why?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">20:15</span> Have you found out who Mordecai is?  Is Mordecai his Hebrew name or his Persian name?  Do you know anything about his lineage through Kish?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">23:16</span> Since the Bible states in John 4:9 that &ldquo;the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans,&rdquo; why did the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4:12 make reference to &ldquo;our father Jacob,&rdquo; knowing that Jacob was an Israelite or a Jew?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">26:50</span> When all of the firstborn were killed in Egypt, why was not Pharaoh killed?  Was he not a firstborn?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">28:11</span> Please compare Genesis 41:41-43 with Esther 6:8-10 and tell whether or not there is a spiritual relationship between what Pharaoh did to Joseph and what King Ahasuerus commanded Haman to do to Mordecai.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:46</span> In Esther 2:19, what does it spiritually mean that &ldquo;the virgins were gathered together the second time&rdquo;?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:00</span> Are the days for Purim of this year a two-day or a three-day period of time?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">49:20</span> (Continued from Question #10):  I am trying to create a bumper sticker in relation to Purim.  I noticed that on the EBF website, you just have March 2012.  Would it be wise to just continue in that format or to actually put the dates of March 7-9?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">51:56</span> What is the exact name of the Yahoo group that you moderate? </li>
  <li><span class="time">52:16</span> We know that the door to salvation was closed on May 21.  Is there a possibility that the door could be opened as of October 21?  </li>
  </ol>
