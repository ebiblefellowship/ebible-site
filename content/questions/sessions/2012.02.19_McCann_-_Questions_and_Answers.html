  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">01:35</span> If our hermeneutic gives us a false timeline, should we not also expect that this gives us other false doctrines as well?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">04:56</span> Continued from previous question: If it turns out that in spite of our best efforts and in good faith that this does not happen, where would we have gone wrong?  Have we been approaching the Bible incorrectly?  If it turns out that we have erred in spite of our best efforts before God, I would be delighted if He would reveal to us how we can properly approach the Bible.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">15:00</span> Could you read Revelation 21:1-5 and speak for a moment on what is awaiting the elect of God in a couple of weeks?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:00</span> Could you look at Numbers 13:32?  What is the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;evil report&rdquo;?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:18</span> Could you compare Ezekiel 38:11, Esther 9:19, and Ezekiel 39:19-20, please?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">30:17</span> Have you noticed that Haman was the son of Hammedatha and that his name means &ldquo;double&rdquo; and also that his name is mentioned five times in the book of Esther?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:56</span> Could you please comment on Isaiah 45:2-3?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:20</span> Do you really believe that the Lord will return next month?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:12</span> Continued from previous question:  I am not criticizing Family Radio at all, but I find it strange that Family Radio proclaimed that Judgment Day was May 21 and that they now believe that it is still the day of salvation, unlike you.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">49:37</span> I have heard a few teachers say that the Lord will probably return on the 9th of March.  Can you please explain what would make March 9th a more likely date?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">53:06</span> I have a question on last week&rsquo;s answer for Mark 3:28-29.  First, how can blasphemy of the Holy Spirit be limited to a corporate sin since Jesus said, &ldquo;he that shall blaspheme,&rdquo; rather than, &ldquo;[they] that shall blaspheme&rdquo;?  Also, Paul did not attribute the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan.  </li>
  </ol>
