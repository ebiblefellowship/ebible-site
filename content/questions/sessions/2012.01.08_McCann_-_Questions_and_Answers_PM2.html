  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">02:00</span> On the Gregorian calendar, we are in the year 2012; but on the Biblical calendar, are we still in 2011?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">05:22</span> Could you compare Esther 6:1 with Revelation 20:15?  In Esther 6:1, do you think that this is a picture of God opening the Book of Life?  The next day is May 21 when Haman is hanged.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">09:12</span> Could you compare Acts 17:31 with Daniel 8:19 and those two verses with Esther 9:27 and 31 in regards to the term &ldquo;time appointed&rdquo;?  This is also mentioned in Habakkuk 2:3.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">11:19</span> In relation to the &ldquo;little book&rdquo; that is mentioned in Revelation 10, is this referring to the book of Esther and not to the entire Bible?  Also, it states in Revelation 10:11, &ldquo;Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.&rdquo;  Could this be referring to the second letter in Esther that went out to all 127 provinces?  Could this prophesying again be just for the believers that Purim may be the last day?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">17:13</span> Jonah 3:4 states, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  Does this word &ldquo;overthrown&rdquo; mean to make a change or does it refer to Nineveh being destroyed?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">20:20</span> (Continued from Question #5):  We know that the Bible tells us that God does not change, and yet we also read in Jonah as well as in other places in the Bible that God repented.  Can you explain this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">25:14</span> (Continued from Question #6):  In actuality, the sins of those in Nineveh would have been laid on Christ, correct?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">26:03</span> Is there anything in the book of Esther that refers to October 21, 2011?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">31:40</span> Revelation 9:5 and 10 talks about five months of torment.  Are there still &ldquo;snares, fire and brimstone&rdquo; falling?  Zechariah 1:11 says that &ldquo;all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.&rdquo;  </li>
  <li><span class="time">33:57</span> From the decree going forth in Esther 8:9 through Esther 9:1, it is a period of 9 months.  Does this have to do with the deliverance that we read about in Romans 8:22?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:25</span> I heard that Family Radio is selling a WFME radio station in the New York area.  Is this true?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:35</span> In relation to Ezekiel 7:2-3 and Hebrews 9:26, was October 21 a spiritual ending?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">46:50</span> Can you clarify or separate Judgment Day from the absolute last day in Revelation 20 where it talks about those who are not written in the Book of Life and who are cast into the &ldquo;lake of fire,&rdquo; which was neither May 21 or October 21?  Also, are you tentative or are you certain that the rapture and the last day will happen in March of this year?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">50:02</span> Did you speak with Mr. Camping today?  If so, does he believe that we are on the right track with the Esther study?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">52:02</span> Could the second woe be the second letter of Purim (Esther 9:29)?  Was the first woe May 21, 2011?  </li>
  </ol>
