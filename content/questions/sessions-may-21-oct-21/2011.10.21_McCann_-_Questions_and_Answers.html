excerpt: |
  Chris starts off making a correction
  to our understanding of May 21, 1988 to October 21, 2011 to use evening-mornings
  instead of morning to evening.  Also, the delay of one day of appearance of the new moon as an
  indicator of the start of the new month in both 1994 and now in 2011.

<p>The following are some notes of the main points of this study.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet created by Mike Cook was previously posted and is available at
<a href="/archives/2011/10/21/may-21-1988-to-october-21-2011/">/archives/2011/10/21/may-21-1988-to-october-21-2011/</a>.</p>

<p class="verse">Genesis 1:5  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>

<p>Note the order is <em>evening</em> and then <em>morning</em>.</p>

<p class="verse">Daniel 8:14  And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred 
days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s 2300 days. Then in verse 26:</p> 

<p class="verse">Daniel 8:26  And the vision of the <em class="verse">evening and the 
morning</em> which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be 
for many days.</p>

<p>That 2300 day period began on May 21, 1988.</p>

<p>May 21, 1988 was the end of the Church age and began the judgment on the Church.  
This began in the evening on May 21, 1988 and ended on May 22, 1988 (sunset to sunset).</p>

<p>This same phenomenon happened in 1994 to start the Latter Rain.</p>

<p>May 21, 2011 Saturday started the 8400th day.  It actually ended the 6100th day of the 
Latter Rain and began the 153 days of judgment.</p>

<p>Judgment day did actually start on May 21st but it started at sunset, not in the morning.</p>

<p>On October 21st it starts day 153 and continues to sunset October 22nd.</p>

<p class="verse">Leviticus 23:34  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The 
fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven 
days unto the LORD.</p>

<p>September 28th was supposed to be the first day of the 7th Hebrew month because
that&rsquo;s when the new moon was expected to be sighted.  However, it 
was actually September 29th as that&rsquo;s when the new moon was first sighted.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.hebcal.com">www.hebcal.com</a>.</p>

<p>A rare condition is when the astronomical conjunction takes place later
in the day.  As it can take 10-48 hours for the new moon to appear,
causing it can push it back further than normal.</p>

<p>The last time this happened in a Biblically signicant date was 1994.
This is already built into our present calendar of the 8400 days.
Mr. Camping recognized this and changed the September 6th date to 
September 7th of the 1st day of the 7th month.</p>

<p>Since this correction was made in 1994, it also needs to be done for
October 21, 2011.<p>

<p>Due to the sunset to sunset keeping of the days, the 23rd day of the 7th
month continues until 5 PM Jerusalem time on October 22nd which equates 
to 11 AM Eastern/US time.</p>

<p>Our error was thinking May 21 to October 21 in terms of our 24 hour days 
starting in the morning rather than in terms of evening-mornings which 
would mean May 21/22 (evening/morning) to October 21/22 (evening/morning).</p>

<p>This still figures out to 153 days and five months.</p>
