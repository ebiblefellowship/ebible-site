Transcript picks up in the middle of one of Chris&rsquo; answers.]  </p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Question is in relation to
verses in Esther and their possible relation to May 21.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Esther 8:7-8:    </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they
have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. Write ye
also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal <i>it </i>with
the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and
sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.  </p>

<p>Then the scribes are called and so forth.  Verse 9 is a very
long verse, so I am not going to read that at this time.  </p>

<p>I do not really want to try to get into the spiritual
meaning of this.  We do know that Haman is a picture of Satan.  The name
&ldquo;Haman&rdquo; means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo;  He is a clear picture of Satan and he is defeated
here by Mordecai and by Esther, and Christ defeats Satan; we know this.  </p>

<p>What I am hesitating about is trying to fit this into the
5-month period.  I think that there is other information that has to be looked
at before we try to do something like that.  But thank you for bringing up these
verses.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>I wanted to have you look
at Genesis 6:16 to help you with your study tonight.  I know that this is
obvious.  I just want to make sure that people know that God did say that there
was a door on the ark.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Genesis 6:16:    </p>

<p class="verse">A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; <i>with
</i>lower, second, and third <i>stories </i>shalt thou make it.  </p>

<p>Right.  There was one door in this huge craft.  This was the
door that was shut on the day that the flood came, which was the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at
Revelation 6:9-11?  This is referring to May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Revelation 6:9-11:    </p>

<p class="verse">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>To be &ldquo;under the altar&rdquo; means that they are covered by the
blood of Christ, just as the sacrificial animal would be slain on the altar and
the blood would be spilled there.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a
loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and
avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given
unto every one of them&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, this is referring to the elect people.  They all get
a white robe.  We all get the same attire.  We all get the same crown and the
same white robe because we all receive the same salvation.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a
little season&hellip;  </p>

<p>This &ldquo;little season&rdquo; would identify with the great
tribulation.  </p>

<p>So these souls are in Heaven.  They are truly saved.  They
are &ldquo;under the altar.&rdquo;  They do not have their bodies, and so they are
waiting.  But they identify with those who are saved in times past; more than
likely, during the church age.  They are told to &ldquo;rest yet for a little season&rdquo;
because there is still the great tribulation that has to take place; and
remember that Satan was &ldquo;loosed a little season.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should
be killed as they <i>were, </i>should be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>No; this is not May 21, 2011.  This is what people are
trying to say.  They are trying to say this about Revelation 11:7 when the two
witnesses are killed.    </p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #3</i>): 
</b>Revelation 11:7 is referring to 1988, and that identifies with those who
are under the altar who get the white robes.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>You have to remember that the
spiritual definition of killing according to John 16 is to be driven out of the
temple, out of the synagogue.  If someone were to drive individuals out of the
church, they &ldquo;killed&rdquo; them.  </p>

<p>So these people died throughout history.  One way or
another, they could have physically and literally died for the cause of
Christ.  But many of them died in the spiritual sense because they held to the
truth and they would have been outcasts.  </p>

<p>Likewise, God&rsquo;s people during the &ldquo;little season&rdquo; are killed
like them.  We also were driven out of the churches and out of the congregations. 
</p>

<p>This does not mean that we were killed on May 21, 2011.  We have to look at this in the way that God is directing us.  With all of
the other information in the Bible, this was a day of freedom.  God gives us no
picture anywhere of carrying a bunch of corpses out of Egypt or carrying
corpses out of Babylon.  </p>

<p>They were living people who came out.  The only dead one was
Joseph when they took his bones with them, but everyone else was alive.  This
is the picture that God wants us to have, not that we were killed in any
sense.  </p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #3</i>):</b><b> 
</b>The killing is not the physical killing.  We were killed in the eyes of the
unsaved who did not believe our testimony.  Our testimony is killed.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We would have to be alive first in
their eyes to be killed.  Since when did the world ever look upon true
believers as though we were anything?  We have always been the offscouring of
the earth.  </p>

<p>What the world thinks of us is not spiritual killing.  God
is concerned about the religious place, the synagogue or the churches, because
that is where spiritual life would be found, not in the world.  So it has
nothing to do with that.  But thank you for your question and your comments.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>There are verses in the
Bible that talk about the shepherd being silenced.  I thought that this could
be talking about our day in relation to Mr. Camping.  For over 50 years, he has
been like a shepherd to so many of us with all of the new information that God
wanted us to know.  Do you see any Biblical relation to those verses and to
what has happened to Mr. Camping and Family Radio in these last days?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>You are going to have to find a verse,
because I am not thinking of a verse where that statement is made.  </p>

<p>We do read what God is doing in Ezekiel 34.  Ezekiel 34 is a
summary of practically God&rsquo;s whole salvation plan.  In the early verses of
Ezekiel 34, we read of lost sheep.  The shepherds of Israel, which would be the
pastors in the churches, are not feeding them.  By their teaching, they are
actually scattering them and making things worse.  This would be during the
church age.  Then God comes to visit and He says that He is &ldquo;against the
shepherds&rdquo; and He causes them to cease.  This might be what you are referring
to.  </p>

<p>We read in Ezekiel 34:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; Behold, I <i>am </i>against the
shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease
from feeding the flock&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the end of the church age.  God removed all
authority, officially, from the churches.  The pastor still calls himself a
pastor and the bishop still calls himself a bishop and they have authority in
the eyes of one another; but in God&rsquo;s sight, they have no more authority than
anybody.  They have zero authority.  God removed their shepherdship or their
feeding of the sheep.  They were not bringing truth, and so He caused it to cease
and the church age came to an end.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Ezekiel 34:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; Behold, I, <i>even </i>I, will
both search my sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in
the day that he is among his sheep <i>that are </i>scattered; so will I seek
out my sheep&hellip;    </p>

<p>Primarily, in a big way, when God brought in the great
multitude, He was searching and seeking His sheep because they were scattered. 
Then He brought them together, as we read in Ezekiel 34:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from
the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the
mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the
country.  </p>

<p>We know that God worked greatly through Mr. Camping,
greatly, like no other man.  He used him for fifty years to feed sheep and to
find sheep, to bring the Gospel.  God used that to gather in the elect and God
also used many others who went on tract trips and many others on the caravans
and individuals here and there.  </p>

<p>This is all due to the glory of God.  He is the One who
moves in individuals &ldquo;to will and to do of <i>his </i>good pleasure.&rdquo;  He is
the One who gives insight, the One who gives understanding.  </p>

<p>I really highly respect Mr. Camping and I thank God for
him.  Without him, I would have continued to be the mess I was for the first
half of my life.  Who knows where I would be if that voice had not been coming
through the radio.  Somehow, God used that to really bless me in ways that I
could never imagine.  But I know that, of himself, Mr. Camping does not know a
thing.  I know that I, also, do not know anything.  Mr. Camping says that he is
a nobody.  Well, I am the chief of nobodies. </p>

<p>This is the truth of every child of God.  We do not know
anything spiritually.  We cannot do anything spiritually.  All glory goes to
God because He gives us understanding, He directs us in truth, and He moves us
to obey Him, to do His good pleasure.  </p>

<p>So this is the case with all of the children of God.  This
is how Christ feeds sheep.  This is how He has found them, this is how He feeds
them, and this is how He has behaved all through history.  We are only
ambassadors on His behalf.  We are the guy who found favor.  </p>

<p>We say this politically.  That person must have been given
some kind of political favor because he was given an ambassadorship.  Well, it
is all by grace and by favor that God chose us, gave us salvation, and sent us
on His behalf.  On the behalf of Christ, we beseech people.  </p>

<p>So if you look at Ezekiel 34, the sheep are lost.  Christ
God found the sheep.  He gathered the sheep on the mountain, and then He feeds
the sheep.  It is a summary of what is going on up until this point.  </p>

<p>Thank you for this question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I know that the spiritual
earthquake of May 21 was a snare to the entire world.  Do you think that
Jehovah will test the believers again?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is a good question, but God has
not stopped.  It did not stop with the great tribulation.  We know that that
was a great time of testing and it is continuing.  It is continuing right now,
and it is spiritual, spiritual, spiritual.  </p>

<p>Some people do not realize that they are making the same
mistake.  They are now trying to relate everything to October 21.  All of the
judgment that the language of the Bible can only explain over these five
months, they are trying to explain that it all takes place on October 21
because we did not see this and because we did not see that.  They want to see
these things on October 21, even though there is no time for all the things
that God has said to happen within the space of a day.  There is no time.  It
has to be over the five months.  </p>

<p>They are falling into the same trap.  They did not see
anything, and this is the death of anyone who does not have spiritual eyes. 
This is the death.  </p>

<p>It is amazing how long some people can cling.  God told us
in Daniel that some cling &ldquo;with flatteries.&rdquo;  Do you remember that?  We read in
Daniel 11:33:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
yet <span class="underline">they shall fall</span> by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by
spoil, <i>many </i>days.  </p>

<p>This is referring to those who understand.  Who understands? 
The wise will understand, but we were going to fall.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Daniel 11:34-35:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when <span class="underline">they shall fall</span>, they shall be holpen [<i>or
helped</i>] with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. 
And <i>some</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;some&rdquo; is not actually there.  So this says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And of them of understanding <span class="underline">shall fall</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Three times we read that &ldquo;them of understanding&rdquo; will fall. 
</p>

<p>Remember that the wise will understand.  We read in Daniel
12:3:      </p>

<p class="verse">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever.  </p>

<p>So the wise are identified as stars, the wise are also those
who understand, and those who understand fall.  </p>

<p>Do stars fall?  Do we read about stars falling?  We read
about this in several places.  One of them is in Matthew 24:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened&hellip;  </p>

<p>The sun is Christ.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the moon shall not give her light&hellip;  </p>

<p>The moon is the Word of God.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the stars shall fall&hellip;  </p>

<p>But these are supposed to be those unsaved &ldquo;wandering stars&rdquo;
in the church.  How does that fit when the sun is Christ, the moon is the Word
of God, and when these stars are identified with the sun and the moon?  These
are the lights in the heavens.  These are the true believers, and these stars
fall immediately after the tribulation.  </p>

<p>I do not think that I have to remind anybody.  It certainly
seemed like we fell.  &ldquo;Them of understanding&rdquo; was even mocked.  This was even
mocked, &ldquo;The wise will understand!  The Bible guarantees it!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Wow?  What happened?  Well, God says here in Daniel 11:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen [<i>helped</i>]
with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.  </p>

<p>I am sorry, but we have to get away from this idea that
everybody who held a sign with us was a brother and a sister and that everybody
who wore the hats and the shirts were brothers and sisters.  </p>

<p>A brother and a sister is someone whom God made part of His
family like us.  It is somebody whom God gave a new heart to.  That is a
brother and a sister.  </p>

<p>We have to question individuals who are going to the point
of denying this and saying that Family Radio should be taken off of the air. 
All of the craziness that we have heard has been from &ldquo;brothers and sisters.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;third part&rdquo; is dead, and we are not hearing this from
them.  They are dead.  We have been hearing this from &ldquo;brothers and sisters.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is why so many have been cast down.  They have been
burdened and saddened.  This is because we could take this if this came from
the world.  We would expect this from the church.  </p>

<p>We thought we were all right in line. The Bible asks, &ldquo;Can
two walk together, except they be agreed?&rdquo;  And yet, no, no.  We see this in
every group.  Even amongst the twelve apostles, there was a Judas.  </p>

<p>So, too, with individuals who proclaimed May 21.  Not all of
them were saved.  If Christ would have come on that day, they would have been
left behind.  Their falling away now is evidence of this.  </p>

<p>Thank you for that question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can you please check Isaiah
19:1-6?  Could verses 4-6 be referring to what happened to the churches and
congregations on May 21, 1988?  Can you please also compare verses 1-4 with
Ezekiel 29:19?  Could the &ldquo;cruel lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;fierce king&rdquo; be referring to King
Nebuchadnezzar who was a picture of Satan?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I am sorry, but this is a little bit
too much for this format that we have right now.  On top of that, I am not all
that familiar with Isaiah 19.  I would probably just stumble around, and so,
unfortunately, I will not be able to answer this question.  But thank you for
your question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Do you have any new
understanding of the 1,335 days in Daniel 12:12 referring to the end times versus
Christ ministering from 29-33 A.D.?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No.  I would recommend reading Mr.
Camping&rsquo;s teaching on this.  It fits perfectly.  There is no other place to fit
this because it had to do with the period of time of Christ&rsquo;s ministry.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>During your study, you
were mentioning the fact that the elect or the body of Christ bring judgment or
fire and brimstone on the world.  Us being the body and Christ being the head,
He directs all of our actions or lack of actions.  Is this what you were
referring to?  We do not really do anything.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>What this is is that there was the
Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life that contained 200 million names.  As long as there were
names in that Book of people who had not yet been redeemed, the Gospel went out
into the world.  But prior to May 21, God saved the very last one.  He
completed it and that act cut off the Gospel to the world.  </p>

<p>This is because Jesus said, &ldquo;I am not sent but unto the lost
sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;  Once the sheep are found, then the Gospel is
cut off.  </p>

<p>As far as that act of saving us, we were acted upon if God
had elected us and saved us and redeemed us.  We did not do anything and we are
continuing to just go about our lives.  But since we are one of those, it is
like He is using us as that battle axe to break in pieces all of the rest of
the world.  </p>

<p>Thank you for that question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In regards to Isaiah 20
where we read about Isaiah being commanded by God to &ldquo;loose the sackcloth from
off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot.  And he did so, walking
naked and barefoot,&rdquo; did this happen literally?  Why did God want him to walk
naked and bear that embarrassment?  Did he really walk naked or was this just
spiritual?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I understand the question and I have
thought about this before.  From everything that we can read, it was literal. 
God commanded Isaiah to remove his clothing and to walk about naked and
barefoot for three years.  For three years, he walked around this way for a
sign, as it says in Isaiah 20:3-4:    </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
and barefoot three years <i>for </i>a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon
Ethiopia; So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and
the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot&hellip;  </p>

<p>This was a sign towards them.  </p>

<p>God sometimes does things that are very humbling to the
individual whom He is dealing with.  Do you remember something that Ezekiel was
told to do?  God wanted Ezekiel to bake bread with man&rsquo;s dung.  Ezekiel was to
use the dung in the preparation of the fire.  Then He changed it to cow&rsquo;s dung. 
</p>

<p>But God does things that, to us, seem unreasonable.  For
example, He told Abraham, &ldquo;Take now thy son, thine only <i>son </i>Isaac, whom
thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a
burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Did this make sense?  Would this have been something that
would have seemed reasonable to us?  </p>

<p>If anyone is prone to questioning God and His will and His
purpose and His plan, the Bible gives plentiful opportunities to do this on
many, many doctrines.  Isaiah could have questioned God and said, &ldquo;Lord, do you
know how humiliating this is?  Do you really want me to go around like this?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Remember that we went around with signs and hats and shirts
for months.  That was a little embarrassing at first.  After awhile, it was
actually very freeing.  It was very freeing because that undercurrent, that
spiritual battle that is always in the world between the people of the world
and the people of God, that thing that is always underneath where we hear those
jabs and blows, this was brought right to the surface.  They knew where we
stood and it became obvious where they stood in response.  </p>

<p>We look at it and say, &ldquo;Wow!  Isaiah walked naked for three
years.&rdquo;  But I am sure that this was a great blessing to him.  I am sure that God
worked things out in his life to where he became very much humbled by this and
broken and submissive to God knowing that He does everything perfectly.  This
is always a good thing.  </p>

<p>Thank you for these verses.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Revelation 9, are the
200 million a spiritual figure of God&rsquo;s elect?  How can we be sure that this is
literal?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The 200 million is an actual number. 
We know this because God at other times has talked about coming with His
saints.  How many saints?  He speaks of ten thousands of His saints in a couple
of places.  </p>

<p>God could have said in Revelation 9, &ldquo;There were ten
thousands of horsemen and I heard the number of them,&rdquo; and this would have been
a number that we could not pinpoint or calculate at all.  Instead, He gives us
the number of 200 million.  This number is found nowhere else in the Bible in
that sense.  There are no 200 million used as a picture anywhere.  </p>

<p>I believe that this is a literal number.  Mr. Camping has
pointed out before that this is a representation of one-tenth of about two
billion professing Christians in the world.  This would be 10% of that; and so
we have this evidence.  </p>

<p>Maybe we cannot be 100% certain, but I think that there is a
great amount of evidence that this is a number that identifies all of the elect
who would be saved throughout time.  </p>

<p>Thank you for that question.  We will stop here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
