  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">02:13</span> Could you look at Ezekiel 14:20-21 and explain why God uses Noah, Daniel, and Job, and could you also look at the &ldquo;four sore judgments&rdquo;?     </li>
  <li><span class="time">10:17</span> Does the Bible say anything about what might be happening during the eight-day period of the Feast of Tabernacles?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">15:47</span> Could you read Genesis 28:12?  Is this what happened on May 21st?  Is this a picture of the rapture?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:35</span> Can you please explain 2 Chronicles 18:16?  I was and am confused with what 2 Chronicles 18:16 says and with what Matthew 24:16-17 says.  Notice the words &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;house.&rdquo;     </li>
  <li><span class="time">22:00</span> Please explain Job 33:15-17 and Job 33:29-30.   </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:18</span> Aaron and Moses were brothers.  Each one of them named one of their sons Eleazar/Eliezer.  If you look at those words in the Hebrew, they are the same identical letters, but they are spelled differently in the English.  You will notice in a concordance or in an Interlinear Bible, one of them has vowel points on one of the letters.  Originally, there were no vowel points.  Who would have only put vowel points on one of them?  Would there be any difference in those words?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">25:50</span> What does &ldquo;sea of glass&rdquo; in Revelation 15:2 mean?  Is this referring to the true believers with Jesus?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:42</span> I have a question about Ezekiel 29.  This is one of a series of chapters where Egypt is being spoken against.  As I understand this, this is usually referring to the church under judgment in those times.  But in Ezekiel 29, especially in verses 11 and 13, God is saying that He is going to bring them back from their captivity after 40 years.  They are only going to be a base nation and not very powerful after that.  Can you tell me what this is referring to?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">34:22</span> In Revelation 22:8-11 and Revelation 19:9-10, this illustration seems to be Christ Himself and yet He says to John not to bow down and worship.  Can you explain these verses?  What is the reason for God telling John this?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:52</span> I heard Mr. Camping&rsquo;s recent message.  In Mr. Carman&rsquo;s message tonight, he agreed with Mr. Camping on the word &ldquo;quietly.&rdquo;  I am trying to understand how the rapture, how the raising of the dead in Christ, and how all of this is supposed to happen quietly.  Is this suggesting that we are not even going to know what will be going on?  Will the unsaved not even have time to understand what will be happening on October 21st?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:33</span> Today, Mr. Camping referred to God&rsquo;s vengeance.  He also said that God would be merciful on the last day, October 21.  How is 2 Thessalonians 1:8 in agreement with a quiet day?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">48:15</span> Please explain Numbers 35:15-19.   </li>
  <li><span class="time">52:34</span> Mr. Carman mentioned that in Scripture sometimes the spiritual is intertwined with the literal.  When the Bible speaks of the heavens on fire and of fervent heat, I picture a natural celestial event causing this.  Also, it reads that some of this will take place before we are raptured and then we are to hold our heads high.  I was wondering what part we will be in before the rapture.     </li>
  <li><span class="time">59:45</span> Could you look at 1 Corinthians 15:52?  Will there be an immediate annihilation for the unsaved on October 21?  This reminds me of the way that God took Enoch.  When the elect get their resurrected bodies, will this be a simultaneous action on that day?     </li>
  <li><span class="time">62:03</span> Did Satan lose all authority on May 21 or just his official rulership over the churches and the world?  Did he lose his rulership over mankind?     </li>
  <li><span class="time">71:54</span> Could you go over Psalm 11:6 and explain our understanding now after May 21 of this word &ldquo;snares&rdquo;?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">76:41</span> Did the thief on the cross have a chance to show or manifest that he was a saved person?  Will there be individuals today who have the same situation such as this case of the thief?   </li>
  </ol>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Ezekiel
14:20-21 and explain why God uses Noah, Daniel, and Job, and could you also
look at the &ldquo;four sore judgments&rdquo;?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>In Ezekiel 14, it really starts back
in verse 13, but it says in Ezekiel 14:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, <i>were </i>in it, <i>as </i>I
live, saith the Lord JEHOVAH, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
shall <i>but </i>deliver their own souls by their righteousness.  </p>

<p>If we would read the whole passage, God says this four
different times.  Twice He identifies the men.  Twice He just says &ldquo;these three
men.&rdquo;  This is to emphasize the number four and the number three.  The number
three meaning God&rsquo;s purpose and the number four meaning that this is
worldwide.  </p>

<p>First of all, this is speaking of them being in the &ldquo;land.&rdquo; 
It does not say that they are in Jerusalem and it does not say that they are in
  Judah in this passage.  It refers to &ldquo;land&rdquo; because this is talking about the
whole world.  </p>

<p>These three men, if we look at the men themselves, are
probably the perfect three men to pick if you wanted to represent believers in
the world and not believers in the church.  </p>

<p>For instance, if it said, &ldquo;Though Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
were in it,&rdquo; we would think of Israel.  If it said, &ldquo;Moses, Joshua, and David,&rdquo;
we would again think of Israel.  But it says, &ldquo;Noah,&rdquo; and what relationship did
Noah have to Israel?  Noah predated Israel by several thousand years.  Noah was
4990 B.C. and Abraham came along about 2,000 plus years later.  </p>

<p>Then there was Daniel.  Daniel was taken from Judah to Babylon
and spent his life in Babylon, which typifies the world.  Remember that
believers were to go into captivity.  We learned about this from Mr. Camping&rsquo;s
studies on Family Radio.  When you leave Judah and you go to Babylon, you are
going into the world.  </p>

<p>Then the third person is Job from the land of Uz.  In Job
1:1, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job&hellip;    </p>

<p>If we read the book of Job, we see no relationship to the land
 of Israel. At least we do not find this mentioned.  We do not find the type of
language that we find in the book of Jeremiah or in Ezekiel where God does
refer to Judah.  In the book of Job, we just read about this man who apparently
was not directly involved with Israel.  </p>

<p>So these three men were very faithful men.  We would not be
able to find more faithful men than Noah, Daniel, and Job.  If they were in the
church and God was saying this, if this were referring to Judah and they were
in the church, we would practically be thinking out loud in our heads, &ldquo;Get out
of that land!  Get out of that church!&rdquo;  This is because that would be the
solution to the problem of not being able to save son or daughter.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;land&rdquo; that God is referring to is the world of five
months that we are presently in.  God&rsquo;s people are out in the world.  We are
not in the church.  There is not one of God&rsquo;s people in the church.  We are in
the world and can any of us save son or daughter today, no matter how faithful,
no matter how diligent we might be?  </p>

<p>Noah was diligent.  He built an ark to the saving of his
house.  Could he save son or daughter if he were here on the earth today?  </p>

<p>What about Job?  Job offered up sacrifices in case his sons
had cursed God in their hearts.  Job was a very good father.  He was a very
godly man.  He was perfect and upright.  Could he save son or daughter if he
were presently alive?  </p>

<p>Daniel, of course, did not have any children because he was
a eunuch, but God uses him as an example of a very, very faithful individual.  </p>

<p>These men were so careful that they wanted to obey God on
every point even willing, like Daniel, to give up their lives and to be thrown
to lions.  Could they save loved ones?  Could they save neighbors?  No.  </p>

<p>God is using these three men to indicate that it is His
purpose.  He brings them up four times to let us know that this is universal
across the earth.  He is letting us know that this has nothing to do with the
true believers themselves.  It is impossible for even one, even your dearest
son or daughter, to become saved at this time because God has saved all of the
ones whose names were written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life.  Salvation just will
not happen anymore.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezekiel 14:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; How much more when I send my
four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome
beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?  </p>

<p>So God is talking about the world, but then He asks, &ldquo;How
much more Jerusalem&rdquo; because they get more stripes.  They get more affliction
during this five-month period, which is what we learn from Revelation 9.  They
are slain immediately on Judgment Day.  There is no hope for them; and yet for
the rest of the world that were not in the church, there is that hope from our
perspective that perhaps God saved them before the Day of Judgment.  But how
much more &ldquo;sore&rdquo; is it for those in the churches (Jerusalem) by these
judgments?  </p>

<p>As far as the judgments, we read of &ldquo;four sore judgments.&rdquo; 
Again, we see the number four indicating the furthest extent and that this is
happening everywhere on earth.  This is just language that God is using to
indicate that His wrath is upon the land where the three men of God are and
upon the church in a more severe way.  This is how we understand this.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>I do not know if the Feast
of Tabernacles coincides exactly with the Jewish calendar, but the Jewish
calendar has this starting on October 12<sup>th</sup> and going to October 20<sup>th</sup>. 
It starts the evening of the 12<sup>th</sup> and I do not know if it finishes
the evening of the 20<sup>th</sup>.  There are eight days here.  Does the Bible
say anything about what might be happening during this eight-day period?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The problem is that there is something
that is not being taken into account when you look at a Jewish calendar.  For
instance, the place where God speaks about the number of days that He gives the
eight days of the feast is in relation to Solomon&rsquo;s keeping of the feast at the
time of the dedication of the temple.    </p>

<p>We read in 2 Chronicles 7:8-10:    </p>

<p class="verse">Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
  Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath
unto the river of Egypt. And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for
they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. And
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away
into their tents, glad and merry in heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that the feast started on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of
the 7<sup>th</sup> month.  On the 23<sup>rd</sup> day, he sent the people
away.  The problem was that the first day of the feast was a Sabbath and the
eighth day was a Sabbath and they could not travel very far on a Sabbath.  They
were limited.  This is where we get an extra day for the feast.  </p>

<p>Just look at it is this way.  It went from day 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, and 22, and day 22 was the eighth day.  The 23<sup>rd</sup> was
the ninth day and it was on the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month
that he sent the people away.  This is where we get October 21.  </p>

<p>If you remember, for awhile, we had thought that this would
be October 20<sup>th</sup>.  Maybe some people are not familiar with this, but
this really kept us from seeing the five months for a period of time.  We had
understood that the 23 years would end on May 21, but then the last day of the
Feast of Tabernacles would be October 20<sup>th</sup>.  </p>

<p>We could not see the five months clearly because this was
not an exact five months.  But then this verse was discovered.  I do not know
who discovered this, but Mr. Camping taught on this.  He noticed that they left
on the 9<sup>th</sup> day, the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup>
month.  This nudged the last day over by one day.  Then it was not too long
after this that people began seeing that this was a period of an exact five months,
and then the whole five-month doctrine that is in the Bible came into view.  </p>

<p>God hid this primarily by hiding the total number of days of
this feast.  Just think about this.  On October 21, this is the 9<sup>th</sup>
day and this is the day that you are sent away.  You are sent away from the
feast.  You leave.  </p>

<p>Well, where is God going to send us?  We are going home. 
This is where you go when you leave the feast.  You go home.  This is how we
understand this spiritually.  God&rsquo;s people will be going home on that very last
day.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you read Genesis
28:12?  Is this what happened on May 21<sup>st</sup>?  Is this a picture of the
rapture?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Genesis 28:12 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the
top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
descending on it.  </p>

<p>This relates in some ways to May 21<sup>st</sup>, but this
has application all through history as God saved His people.  </p>

<p>Immediately upon salvation, what happens to a person?  When
an individual becomes saved, they are transported up into Heaven.  In a way,
yes, this is true.  Ephesians 2 tells us that we are seated in heavenly places
in Christ.  </p>

<p>We would have to look into the past, prior to May 21, but
let us say that an individual became saved.  God transported them up to Heaven,
and yet they never left this earth.  They did not go anywhere.  </p>

<p>Well, the way God views this is that they did spiritually. 
Their soul went up to Heaven, in a sense, and they were seated in Christ.  Then
Christ sent them right back down; and so they were back in their body.  </p>

<p>This is why we are left in physical bodies when God saved
us.  He very wisely made this a two-part process.  He did not save us both body
and soul at the moment of salvation in this life, or we would be going around
like Moses or Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration.  People would not even be
able to get near us.  There would be no way for them to even look at us,
because we would be shining so brightly.  </p>

<p>So He saved the soul but left us in a corrupt body that is
still seeing the effects of sin.  He did this so that we could be messengers
and carry His Word to the world and be just like them.  They do not see any
difference in us and there is not, except that God changed us inwardly.  </p>

<p>This is why we read in the Fourth Gospel, John 1, something
that Jesus is saying to Nathanael in the very last verse of John 1.  This is
referring back to what we read in Genesis 28 and Jacob&rsquo;s ladder.  It says in
John 1:51:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
ye shall see heaven open, and the angels [<i>messengers</i>] of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.</p>

<p>Again, this is a good verse to show that this word for
angels is not always referring to angelic beings.  This is referring to people,
because we are the messengers of God.  We ascend in Christ and we also descend
also upon Him, and then we are sent into the world with the Gospel.  This is
what Genesis 28 is looking at.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can you please explain 2
Chronicles 18:16?  I was and am confused with what 2 Chronicles 18:16 says and with what Matthew 24:16-17 says.  Notice the words &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and
&ldquo;house.&rdquo;    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>2 Chronicles 18:16 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,
as sheep that have no shepherd: and JEHOVAH said, These have no master; let
them return <i>therefore </i>every man to his house in peace.  </p>

<p>I have not looked at this particular verse.  This sounds
very similar and very much like verses in Ezekiel 34 where God is faulting the
shepherds of Israel, which would be typifying the pastors of the churches of
our day.  He is faulting them for not taking care of the flock and for not feeding
them and for, actually, scattering the flock.  </p>

<p>When truth is not brought, when there is teaching that is
faulty and deceitful and not true, like we find in the churches today, then
what this accomplishes is that this scatters God&rsquo;s sheep.  This is why God says
in Ezekiel 34 that He will cause the shepherds to cease from feeding the
flock.  Then He speaks about searching them out and that He Himself will feed
them.  And He did find all of the lost sheep and now, at this time, He is
feeding them.  </p>

<p>But this phrase here, &ldquo;These have no master,&rdquo; is something
that I have not looked at in this passage or in other passages, and so I would
like to be a little careful with this verse.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please explain Job 33:15-17
and Job 33:29-30.  Thank you.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Let us read Job 33:15.  I will start
in verse 14.  It says in Job 33:14-17:    </p>

<p class="verse">For God speaketh once, yea twice, <i>yet man </i>perceiveth it
not. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in
slumberings upon the bed; Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
instruction, That he may withdraw man <i>from his </i>purpose, and hide pride
from man.  </p>

<p>There may be more involved than this, but one thing that we
can see is that God is in control of all people.  He speaks of this in Proverbs
where He says, &ldquo;The king's heart <i>is </i>in the hand of the LORD, <i>as </i>the
rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Unsaved man has his plans and his desires and his ideas. 
They normally do not include God in their thinking at all.  They are going to
do things their way, but God is saying here that He still works in their lives
and that they will finally accomplish His purpose.  </p>

<p>This is like Pharaoh who would not let the people go, and
God tells us that He hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart.  He is the One who wanted
Pharaoh to do exactly as Pharaoh did, even though it was all Pharaoh&rsquo;s sin. 
God was not to blame for his sin, but He used that to do His will.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Aaron and Moses were
brothers.  Each one of them named one of their sons Eleazar/Eliezer.  If you
look at those words in the Hebrew, they are the same identical letters, but
they are spelled differently in the English.  You will notice in a concordance
or in an Interlinear Bible, one of them has vowel points on one of the
letters.  Originally, there were no vowel points.  Who would have done this? 
Who would have only put vowel points on one of them?  Would there be any
difference in those words?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not think that who did this is
important.  We know that when God gave His Word in the Hebrew, there were no
vowel points.  If we are looking up a word and we see the same consonants, we
know that it is the same word.  It just makes things a little tougher for us to
search this out.  But I have not looked into who did that or why, and so I
would not want to say right now.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>What does &ldquo;sea of glass&rdquo; in
Revelation 15:2 mean?  Is this referring to the true believers with Jesus?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>In that verse, we do find the true
believers.  We read in Revelation 15:2:    </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his
mark, <i>and </i>over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having
the harps of God.  </p>

<p>Those who got the victory are God&rsquo;s people who came out of
great tribulation.  We are the seven messengers.  We are the true believers.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;sea of glass&rdquo; is a sea that has been purified.  In the
Old Testament, the priests would have to wash in the &ldquo;brazen sea&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;molten sea&rdquo; before entering into the temple.  That would be for the purpose of
being ceremonially clean.  Spiritually, this pointed to being washed from sin
before someone was to serve God.  </p>

<p>Here, this is indicating that those believers, typified by
these seven messengers, will have been washed.  They will have their sins
cleansed and they will be holy in God&rsquo;s sight, because this is the whole
company of the elect.  </p>

<p>I am glad that you brought this verse up because I wanted to
mention something.  Notice that it says that they got the victory over the
beast.  This indicates four things that they were victorious over: the beast,
his image, his mark, and the number of his name.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;victory&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; in some
places and also &ldquo;prevail&rdquo; in some places.  For example, it says in Revelation
5:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath <span class="underline">prevailed</span>
to open the book&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the word &ldquo;victory.&rdquo;  It means to be victorious like
God and His people were with His salvation plan on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p>In Genesis 7, the word &ldquo;prevail/prevailed&rdquo; is found four
times in relationship to the flood waters.  This is just as we have four
victories over the beast, his image, his mark, and the number of his name.  </p>

<p>In a couple of places in Genesis 7, God emphasizes that the
waters prevailed.  He says in Genesis 7:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
earth&hellip;</p>

<p>One time, He says that they prevailed upon the &ldquo;high
hills.&rdquo;  Another time, He says that they prevailed over the &ldquo;mountains.&rdquo;  We
read in Genesis 7:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;hills&rdquo; is a word that means &ldquo;mountains.&rdquo;  It is
translated as &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; in the very next verse.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and all the high <span class="underline">hills</span>, that <i>were </i>under the whole
heaven, were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the <span class="underline">mountains</span>
were covered.  </p>

<p>God is making this point.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Genesis 7:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.  </p>

<p>This was for a period of five months.  God is emphasizing
this four times and four times the seven messengers or the true believers got
the victory.  They prevailed.  </p>

<p>Let us just look at a couple of verses in Revelation 17 that
are referring to the beast that came out of the bottomless pit.  Here, God will
identify the beast with mountains.  We read in Revelation 17:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition&hellip;    </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 17:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And here <i>is </i>the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads
are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings:
five are fallen, and one is, <i>and </i>the other is not yet come; and when he
cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast that was, and is not, even
he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.  </p>

<p>So &ldquo;the beast&rdquo; is of the seven kings and the seven kings are
the seven mountains.  </p>

<p>Look at Revelation 17:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall <span class="underline">overcome</span>
them&hellip;</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; is that same word for &ldquo;prevailed&rdquo; in
Revelation 5:5.  The Lamb will prevail over the beast who is likened to
mountains.  </p>

<p>We read about this five months or these 150 days in Genesis
7, where God emphasizes four times that the waters prevailed &ldquo;greatly upon the
earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;exceedingly upon the earth,&rdquo; over the &ldquo;high hills,&rdquo; and over &ldquo;the
mountains.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because He wants us to know that for this five-month
period Satan is put down.  The beast is deposed.  The waters typify the Word of
God, the Gospel.  God is victorious.  Therefore, His people are victorious,
like we read in that verse in Revelation 15.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I have a question about
Ezekiel 29.  Ezekiel 29 is one of a series of chapters where Egypt is being
spoken against.  As I understand this, this is usually referring to the church
under judgment in those times.  But in Ezekiel 29, especially in verses 11 and
13, God is saying that He is going to bring them back from their captivity
after 40 years.  They are only going to be a base nation and not very powerful
after that.  Can you tell me what this could possibly be referring to?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I am not prepared at this moment to
discuss this.  I know that Mr. Camping did a study on this previously.  The
reference to 40 years is a little difficult.  I think that Mr. Camping
identified this with the great tribulation and as a time of testing.  But I
really cannot get into this in this format at this time.  I do not really feel
prepared to do this, and so I am sorry that I cannot help you.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Revelation 22:8-11 and
Revelation 19:9-10, this illustration seems to be Christ Himself and yet He
says to John not to bow down and worship.  Can you explain these verses?  What
is the reason for God telling John this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The way that this is written, this
does appear to be confusing.  Let us read Revelation 22:7:    </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I come quickly: blessed <i>is </i>he that keepeth the
sayings of the prophecy of this book.</p>

<p>This is Christ who is speaking.  Then we read in Revelation
22:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I John saw these things, and heard <i>them. </i>And when I
had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
showed me these things.  </p>

<p>In order to understand who this &ldquo;angel&rdquo; is, we have to back
up to Revelation 21:9, which identifies this &ldquo;angel&rdquo; as:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues&hellip;  </p>

<p>God identifies for us who is showing John this vision.  It
is one of those seven messengers.  </p>

<p>So now John is falling down before his feet, and then we
read in Revelation 22:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then saith he unto me, See <i>thou do it </i>not: for I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the
sayings of this book: worship God.  </p>

<p>This messenger is directing John to Jesus, &ldquo;Do not worship
me.  I am a fellow servant.  I am just a redeemed sinner like you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then it says in Revelation 22:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book: for the time is at hand.  </p>

<p>This is referring to now especially.  God has opened this up
completely.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 22:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.  </p>

<p>We have already learned that this has to do with God saving
all of the elect.  If you are righteous, you are going to remain that way.  If
you are filthy, which means that you are still in your sins, you are going to
remain that way.  There is no more salvation.  </p>

<p>Revelation 21:9 identifies why this response is given to
John.  But look at how God writes this.  We read in the following verse, in
Revelation 22:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward <i>is </i>with me&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is speaking of Christ again, but there is no
introduction as to when Christ will speak one verse or as to when the messenger
is speaking in one verse.  God did not do it this way because He wanted to hide
certain aspects of this.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I heard Mr. Camping&rsquo;s
recent message.  In Mr. Carman&rsquo;s message tonight, he agreed with Mr. Camping on
the word &ldquo;quietly.&rdquo;  I am trying to understand how the rapture, how the raising
of the dead in Christ, and how all of this is supposed to happen quietly.  Is
this suggesting that we are not even going to know what will be going on?  Will
the unsaved not even have time to understand what will be happening on October
21<sup>st</sup>?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I had heard what he was thinking about
when God brings the final day of this 153-day period of judgment.  From what
Mr. Camping was saying, he is thinking that since we have learned so much about
the gentleness and goodness of God and since He takes no pleasure in the death
of the wicked that God will take them almost as if someone dies in their sleep
at night.  </p>

<p>I believe that he refers to a passage in Isaiah with King
Hezekiah and the army of the Assyrians that came against Jerusalem.  When they
woke up in the morning, the Assyrians were all dead men.  There were 185,000 of
them.  I think that this is one of the places that Mr. Camping was thinking
of.  </p>

<p>One thing we can see, and I think that this is very true, is
that there is no room on October 21<sup>st</sup> for everything to take place. 
When we look at all of the verses that talk about the weeping and gnashing of
teeth and all of the judgment that we read about in Revelation 9, such as the
torment, there is no time for all of these things to take place.  There is no
room for all of this.  </p>

<p>So the idea that God would just come for the unsaved and
take them and end this world very quickly and mercifully fits in with
everything that we are learning really, because now is the fire and brimstone
that is continuing throughout the five months.  </p>

<p>Even this is very gentile and very kind.  What a merciful
God!  Primarily, this is the judgment.  He had a Book with all of those whom He
intended to save, 200 million.  Their names were written in this Book.  He
saved the very last one on the very last page, and then He closed the Book. 
There is now no more salvation and this is the torment on the world.  This is
what kills the third part.  This is the judgment that we are reading about
again and again and again.  </p>

<p>The seven messengers pouring out seven vials of the seven
last plagues sounds pretty horrible, and yet what is this but that the smoke
fills the temple and that no man can enter into the temple.  </p>

<p>Who is the temple?  It says in Revelation 21 that the Lamb
is the temple.  And no man can enter into the temple until the seven plagues
are poured out.  </p>

<p>This again shows us that for everything to happen on the
last day is all backwards.  If God takes His people into the temple on the very
last day, how would this fit?  They are pouring out plagues and no man can
enter in until the plagues are done.  That would not fit.  </p>

<p>Now the temple is closed and no one can be added into Christ,
who is that temple, until these plagues are finished, and then God takes His
people.  He takes them out of the world and into eternity.  </p>

<p>The verse where we can read about the 185,000 is Isaiah
37:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the angel of JEHOVAH went forth, and smote in the camp of
the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose
early in the morning, behold, they <i>were </i>all dead corpses.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Today, Mr. Camping referred
to God&rsquo;s vengeance.  He also said that God would be merciful on the last day,
October 21.  How is 2 Thessalonians 1:8 in agreement with a quiet day?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>What Mr. Camping said was that the
Lord has stated, &ldquo;Vengeance <i>is </i>mine, saith the Lord.&rdquo;  This means that
it is up to Him to decide how He wants to mete out justice.  It is not our
particular ideas about it.  </p>

<p>We have already been corrected about hell because mankind
has thought that this is how it should be, and it is ruthless, very ruthless.  Then
we developed some other ideas over the five months and how they should be and
we were wrong again.  </p>

<p>So let us leave vengeance in God&rsquo;s hands.  Let it belong to
Him.  We can know that He does all things perfectly and justly.  If God
determines that it is a just weight and balance to just kill man and that it is
&ndash; very quietly, there is no more rebellion, He puts it down &ndash; then we should
not argue.  We should be glad because He is talking about some of the people
who are in our own families.  </p>

<p>It says in 2 Thessalonians 1:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Seeing <i>it is </i>a righteous thing with God to recompense
tribulation to them that trouble you; And to you who are troubled rest with us,
when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, </p>

<p>With His messengers, and this goes back to Matthew 25 with
the separation of the sheep from the goats.  </p>

<p>He is seated on the throne of His glory with all of His
angels with Him.  This is happening now.  This is taking place now.  God is
judging the world and the saints are judging with Him.  We are His battle
axe.   </p>

<p>Again, what is that weapon?  It is that He saved us all; all
of the elect are brought in.  This is the judgment that we read about again and
again and again.  This is how we are judging the world with Him.  </p>

<p>We did not do anything and we are not doing anything today. 
This is how quiet it is.  But God is using the fact that He gathered them all,
that He has found all of His sheep.  This is the weapon of His indignation.  </p>

<p>Then it says in 2 Thessalonians 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  </p>

<p>Stop thinking physically.  Stop thinking naturally. 
Spiritual fire and brimstone is falling right now.  In &ldquo;flaming fire,&rdquo; God is
taking vengeance.  The Day of Judgment began May 21.  It is Judgment Day.  This
is what this means.  Right now is Judgment Day and therefore God is using
language to typify this and to point to this.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 2 Thessalonians 1:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;  </p>

<p>What happens at the end of the five months?  They are burned
up.  They are burned up forever and this is a real destruction.  It is an
eternal destruction from God.  </p>

<p>There is God in His Heaven and all of His elect with Him
living gloriously without end.  Here are these poor people made in His image
and they are just completely annihilated and destroyed.  This will happen on
the very last day of the Day of Judgment.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please explain Numbers
35:15-19.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is speaking of the city of
refuge.  We read in Numbers 35:15-16:    </p>

<p class="verse">These six cities shall be a refuge, <i>both </i>for the children
of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every
one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. And if he smite him with
an instrument of iron, so that he die, he <i>is </i>a murderer: the murderer
shall surely be put to death.</p>

<p>Here God is making a distinction between murder and
accidental killing.  I think that they call this manslaughter in our courts
today.  </p>

<p>In Deuteronomy 19, there is an example of a man who goes
into the forest to cut a tree.  He is with his neighbor.  While cutting the
tree, the axe head comes off the helve.  It flies off, hits his neighbor, and
kills him.  Then what happens is that the man who accidentally (not
intentionally) killed his neighbor now has to run, even though he could say
that this was an accident.  </p>

<p>There was a system back then in order to prove if something
like this was an accident.  A man had to run to a city of refuge.  There were
six of these and they were strategically located.  He had to make it to one of
these cities because the kin of the individual who was slain would appoint
someone else, maybe a close relative, who would become a manslayer.  He would
become an &ldquo;avenger of blood.&rdquo;  This is how the Bible puts this.  </p>

<p>He would go after the man who had killed his brother or one
of his kin.  If he found him before he got to the city of refuge, he would kill
him justly and legally.  God&rsquo;s Law said that he could kill him.  The man who
had accidentally killed his neighbor had to make it into the city.  Once he
made it into the city, he could seek asylum and refuge and the avenger of blood
could not pursue him into one of these cities.  He could camp outside the city
and wait.  If that man ever stepped out of the city, he could kill him.  But as
long as he stayed within the boundaries of that city, he could not touch him.  </p>

<p>So the man would have to stay there until the death of the
high priest.  Once the high priest died, the man was free to leave the city of
refuge.  Of course, we can see the picture.  We are to flee to Christ.  We are
to go to Jesus.  He is our safety, spiritually.  It is the death of the Lord
Jesus, the Great High Priest, that frees us from the avenger of blood, which
would typify the Law of God.  </p>

<p>I am still thinking prior to May 21 with God&rsquo;s Law on our
heels.  There is nowhere for anyone to flee now because this is all said and
done, but this is what this is teaching.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>13<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Mr. Carman mentioned that
in Scripture sometimes the spiritual is intertwined with the literal.  When the
Bible speaks of the heavens on fire and of fervent heat, I picture a natural
celestial event causing this.  Also, it reads that some of this will take place
before we are raptured and then we are to hold our heads high.  I was wondering
what part we will be in before the rapture.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It talks about heat in 2 Peter 3.  It
so happens that I was looking at Revelation 16 today with the seven messengers
who are pouring out their seven vials of the seven last plagues.  It says in
Revelation 16:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the fourth angel [<i>messenger</i>] poured out his vial upon
the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And men were
scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over
these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>

<p>This is speaking of &ldquo;great heat&rdquo; and this has to do with the
five months.  And so what is God really looking at?  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;scorch&rdquo; helps us because this is found twice here
and then this is found twice elsewhere, once in a parable in Matthew and once
in a parable in Mark, both of these parables are the same parable of the sower.
 This parable says that when the seed falls upon stony ground, it has no depth
of earth.  </p>

<p>Let us look at this parable in Mark 4.  We read in Mark
4:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
root, it withered away.  </p>

<p>It landed on stony ground; therefore, the root could not go
deep.  There was no depth of earth as it says in the Matthew account.  And the
root is referring to Christ.  The Bible tells us that He is the Root of David
and the Root of Jesse.  </p>

<p>The real problem is that people heard the Word of God but
there was no root or no Christ in them, and so they never really became born
again.  They were not deep people, spiritually.  </p>

<p>Then Jesus explains in Mark 4:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
immediately they are offended.  </p>

<p>Think of May 21.  The reason I say this is because of
Revelation 16.  God joins the word &ldquo;scorched&rdquo; from this parable to the pouring
out of the seven vials of the seven last plagues.  One of these vials is poured
out on the sun which scorches men so that they blaspheme God.  </p>

<p>Look at it this way.  A lot of people joined the bandwagon
prior to May 21.  Maybe they did this two years prior or maybe it was one year
prior or maybe it was only two weeks prior.  Just think of how much this was in
focus on the television and in the media and on billboards.  </p>

<p>People could just think, &ldquo;At least these people are getting
the Word out.  It appears that they are doing what Christ would have us to do,
and so I am going to join up.&rdquo;  Then they got a T-shirt and a hat and they
carried a sign.  But who knew what was going on in their hearts.  We had no
idea.  </p>

<p>They heard the Word.  For awhile, they were really joyful. 
It says in Matthew that these who immediately with joy receive it, but there
was no depth of earth.  It was a rock, and this is the heart of man.  Naturally,
we have a rock and the seed actually cannot get by this rock.  There is no
root.  </p>

<p>Then May 21 comes and nothing physical happened like they
were expecting.  It was all spiritual.  And here we are four months into this
and they do not understand.  They do not buy this and they do not believe
this.  </p>

<p>When we really get down to it, this is not because the Bible
is not teaching this.  This is because they have a carnal mind.  They have a
natural mind that cannot understand spiritual things.  A spiritual judgment is
nothing to them, and yet for the Word&rsquo;s sake, they took abuse.  </p>

<p>Leading up to it, they had a lot of friends here who they
joined with; but afterwards, during the Day of Judgment and of affliction and
of persecution from friends and family and the whole world looking down on them
as deceivers, they get offended.  </p>

<p>This happened with some right away.  For some, this happened
very quickly.  Immediately, it did not take long and notes were flying from
people who were claiming that this was all a scam and that we were to never
listen to Family Radio again.  </p>

<p>I remember seeing those notes and thinking, &ldquo;What?  Do not
ever listen to Family Radio again?&rdquo;  Some people said that Mr. Camping is a
false prophet.  I thought, &ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo;  I was amazed that this was what
people were actually thinking.  </p>

<p>But now I have seen this with this word &ldquo;scorch&rdquo; and this
explains these things.  This explains it.  It is during this time when men are
being scorched that this falling away amongst ourselves has taken place.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>14<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at 1
Corinthians 15:52?  Will there be an immediate annihilation for the unsaved on
October 21?  This reminds me of the way that God took Enoch.  When the elect
get their resurrected bodies, will this be a simultaneous action on that day?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It says in 1 Corinthians 15:51-52:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed.  </p>

<p>This is our hope and expectation.  This is what we are looking
forward to in just a few weeks.  In a very, very short period of time, we are
looking forward to God fulfilling His Word.  </p>

<p>We live in this world and it is hard for us to imagine its
end, but remember that God does say that &ldquo;these words,&rdquo; meaning His Word the
Bible, &ldquo;are true and faithful.&rdquo;  We can trust it and so we do.  We are waiting
on Him to fulfill all things.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>15<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Did Satan lose all
authority on May 21 or just his official rulership over the churches and the
world?  Did he lose his rulership over mankind?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is a good question.  We know
without any question that he did lose authority in the church and in the
world.  </p>

<p>Think about the king of Babylon.  The king of Babylon
reigned over Babylon and God uses Babylon in two ways.  It typifies the church
and it typifies the world depending on the context.  After 70 years, he is
killed and who took over?  Cyrus took over.  Cyrus is also known as Darius, the
Mede and the Persian.  He takes the kingdom.  </p>

<p>Someone asked me a good question about Ezekiel 32.  In
Ezekiel 32, we read about the fowls and how God was talking about the dragon
being pulled out of the waters and left in the open field for the fowls to feed
upon him.  Then we saw in the context of verses 7 and 8 that this is related to
the darkening of the sun and the moon and the stars.  </p>

<p>So someone looked at this context and then brought up verse
11.  We read in Ezekiel 32:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; The sword of the king of Babylon
shall come upon thee.  By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude
to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the
pomp of Egypt&hellip;  </p>

<p>Since we have been seeing that the end of the 70 years is
when Satan falls, and here we are reading of Egypt and Pharaoh being likened to
a dragon, typifying Satan, then how can the &ldquo;king of Babylon&rdquo; come against
him?  Would this not relate to Satan and mean that the 70-year period had not
ended?  </p>

<p>The answer is that the &ldquo;king of Babylon&rdquo; is a title for the
one who rules Babylon.  This is a parabolic chapter.  Pharaoh is not a whale in
the sea or a dragon, and the &ldquo;king of Babylon&rdquo; is not who we think either.  In
this case, this is Christ.  He is the &ldquo;king of Babylon.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Take a look at Ezra 5:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon <i>the same </i>king
Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.  </p>

<p>This is Cyrus the shepherd, Cyrus the anointed one, Cyrus
who took the kingdom of Babylon.  So, of course, he becomes the king of Babylon. 
He is the ruler over Babylon.  </p>

<p>What this is spiritually teaching is that Christ rules over
the world right now.  He rules over the world.  He rules over the church.  He
rules over everything.  Satan is put down.  </p>

<p>How then can we explain evil and the bad things that are happening
to God&rsquo;s people?  Keep in mind the book of Daniel.  The first five chapters are
an historical narrative.  That historical narrative ends with the king of Babylon
being killed.  Chapter 6 actually continues this historical narrative, but now
it is different because Cyrus or Darius has taken the kingdom.  </p>

<p>Cyrus was very favorable to Daniel.  Daniel had a friend on
the throne.  Did it help Daniel?  Yes; of course it did.  But by the end of
that chapter, Daniel ends up in the lions&rsquo; den.  </p>

<p>This happened to Daniel because there were still wicked
men.  Even though the king was favorable to Daniel, he still let things play
out.  He thought the best of Daniel and he thought the best for Daniel and he
told him that his God would deliver him, and He did.  </p>

<p>So, too, at the time, at the end 70 years, Christ is
ruling.  We may go through some trials and we probably will.  There may be some
afflictions and persecutions, but it is guaranteed that the lions&rsquo; mouths are
shut.  </p>

<p>Speaking of this, there is one other verse I would like to
point out.  I never knew why God put this verse here in 2 Timothy.  We referred
to this verse a few times leading up to May 21<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p>The Apostle Paul was someone whom God used as a pattern of
the believers.  In the earlier verses of 2 Timothy 4, he said that the time of
his departure was at hand.  He said that he had finished his course, so he is
talking about the end.  </p>

<p>This was the end of Paul&rsquo;s ministry, which typified the end of
the believer&rsquo;s duty.  How did the book of Acts end?  It ends proclaiming the
acts of the sent ones.  We are the sent ones.  It ends with Paul in Rome; and
so, too, it ended with us as we brought the Gospel to the world.  </p>

<p>So he has finished his course and then it says in this
context in 2 Timothy 4:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember that the two witnesses stood on their feet during
the time of the latter rain.  This is when we brought the Gospel to the world. 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and strengthened me; that by me&hellip;  </p>

<p>Not Paul, but the believers.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that </i>all the
Gentiles&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can translate this as &ldquo;nations.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;all the Gentiles [<i>nations</i>] might hear&hellip;   </p>

<p>When did this happen?  This Gospel of the Kingdom was to go
into all the world and be preached unto all nations and then the end would
come.  We just witnessed this.  </p>

<p>This was one thing that God let us witness and this was a
big thing.  This was a big thing that had never happened before.  We know that
He saved a great multitude, but we did not witness this.  </p>

<p>I think all of the time that I would like to see buses come
filled with this great multitude; but if we go by our natural sight, we will
not see this.  I have not seen this at all.  God saved all of His elect prior
to May 21, but we did not witness that.  Even so, we are waiting and praying,
&ldquo;O Lord, maybe Your light will arise and shine in this individual&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; but
we are not seeing this outwardly.  </p>

<p>The one thing that we saw that God permitted was an
incredible event that took place all across the earth.  The preaching was fully
known.  This also relates to God opening the Scriptures so that His Word could
be fully known for the first time.  </p>

<p>Then it continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and <i>that </i>all the Gentiles [<i>nations</i>] might hear&hellip;   </p>

<p>But then notice the next phrase:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  </p>

<p>This is what happened to Daniel, and so God is relating
Daniel&rsquo;s experience to Paul who typifies the believers.  We cannot miss where
He is putting this.  </p>

<p>Paul is sharing the Gospel, but Paul never did this
historically.  He never taught all the nations, but the believers did at the
end.  </p>

<p>So I think that God is assuring is that the next stage is
when Cyrus takes the kingdom.  Then things might get dark and scary.  </p>

<p>I remember May being a little scary.  I thought that people
were looking at me.  I was on television a couple of times.  I would think,
&ldquo;That person is recognizing me!&rdquo;  I thought about when the stones might start
flying.  </p>

<p>But what happened?  Nothing!  Did anybody get hurt that we
know of?  I do not know anybody who got hurt physically.  </p>

<p>God has protected us all the way.  We do have four weeks
left; but even if we were to die physically, this would not mean that God had
not protected us, because He has already safely delivered us.  But here, I
think that He is giving us a little assurance that after this declaration, we
will be greatly protected.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>16<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you go over Psalm
11:6 and explain our understanding now after May 21 of this word &ldquo;snares&rdquo;?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Psalm 11:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
horrible tempest: <i>this shall be </i>the portion of their cup.  </p>

<p>If you look at this verse and compare this to Revelation
14:10-11 where God speaks about fire and brimstone and the cup of His wrath,
this is very similar.  </p>

<p>This is upon the wicked and this, without question, is
speaking of His judgment upon unsaved people; but God threw a word here in this
verse in Psalm 11 that has to make us stop and think.  It is the word
&ldquo;snares.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Psalm 11:6 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone&hellip;    </p>

<p>People love to pick and choose.  They have their mind set in
a certain way.  They have a picture of an angry and wrathful God who is going
to just rain literal fire and brimstone or eternal damnation down to burn up
the sinner and to burn up the wicked people.  But they have a problem because
this says &ldquo;snares.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This words means exactly as it sounds.  It is referring to a
trap.  It is like a gin that is set for an animal. </p>

<p>This other language fits Judgment Day; and so God is
indicating that on Judgment Day, it will be a trap.  If God had literally
destroyed the world, where would the trap have been in that?  Nobody would be
trapped, but they would be experiencing the judgment of God.  </p>

<p>Luke 21 is a chapter dealing with the great tribulation and
the time after, which we are in.  It says in Luke 21:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;unawares&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; in 1
Thessalonians 5:3 where it speaks of Christ coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night&rdquo;
and then sudden destruction takes people.  This is the same word, and so we are
already put on notice.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 21:35:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of a trap for all unsaved people.  </p>

<p>What was the trap?  How about God bringing Judgment Day and
people not even knowing this and that they can continue with their lives like
this is any other period of history?  This is like it is just any other day or
any other time.  They are just going along.  They heard about May 21.  They were
expecting the worse.  They were expecting a great earthquake and maybe perhaps
literal fire and brimstone falling, but nothing happened.  </p>

<p>This is the trap.  This is the snare that has taken the
world.  They have relaxed.  They have gone back to their normal everyday lives,
mostly.  And what is that normal everyday life?  It is a life of sin.  It is
life of sin against God.  </p>

<p>So people have gone back to their sins, and yet God did
bring judgment.  It was Judgment Day and we are continuing on in this period of
time.  Then finally on the very last day, it will all be over and this world
will be over.  This is the snare that Psalm 11 is talking about.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>17<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Did the thief on the cross
have a chance to show or manifest that he was a saved person?  Will there be
individuals today who have the same situation such as this case of the thief?  </p>

<p><b>Chris:  </b>It is not necessary.  It will happen in the
lives of some people, but this is not necessary.  </p>

<p>Think of a baby.  If God saved a baby or a little child, can
that child give any evidence that they are a child of God?  Maybe the child
would be somehow strangely truthful.  This is possible.  But still, this is not
absolute proof that they are saved.  </p>

<p>We cannot look at a child and know this and I think that this
is true of other people, too.  I have been thinking about this also.  </p>

<p>How far can someone go into this five-month period where God
saved them already, and yet they do not as yet give any evidence?  Well, I do
not know.  I guess that they can go all the way to the very last day.  This is
in God&rsquo;s hands and under His control.  We do not know who they are.  </p>

<p>But it is nice to think about this if you see someone who is
maybe doing something differently.  Maybe they had no willpower or no control
over themselves; and now, all of a sudden, they are exercising some willpower
in their life.  They still have not said anything to you about Christ or
anything, but at least there is that hope.  </p>

<p>I think that God has also done this to maybe give us a
little encouragement for people we know for us to keep praying.  Let us keep
praying for them.  Maybe this individual could have been one of those whom God
saved.  </p>
