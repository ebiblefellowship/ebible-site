<p><b><i>Question #1 is a question that came from the EBF
website:</i>  </b>What happens to the unsaved after October 21, 2011?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>This is a good
question.  May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  This begins the process of five
months.  Even though God calls it &ldquo;the day of judgment,&rdquo; this extends for five
months.  God is privileged to do this if He wants to and He does do this in
other places.  He speaks of Israel&rsquo;s time in the wilderness, even though it was
forty years, as a much shorter period of time.  </p>

<p>We read in Hebrews 3:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
temptation in the wilderness: When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw
my works forty years.  </p>

<p>Here it was called &ldquo;the day of temptation,&rdquo; and yet it was a
forty-year period.  </p>

<p>So it is God&rsquo;s good pleasure if He wants to refer to this as
&ldquo;the day of judgment&rdquo; and then cause it to last five months.  He has set
precedent in the Bible showing us that He does this.  </p>

<p>The end of the five months will be October 21, 2011.  God tells us that this is the day that He will destroy the earth, as we read in 2
Peter 3:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
shall be burned up.  </p>

<p>What are these &ldquo;works&rdquo; that God is talking about?  Is He
talking about the skyscrapers or the works of art?  Is He talking about all of
these things that man has been building in this world?  Of course, these are
going to be burned up, but He has something else in mind when He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the works that are therein shall be burned up.  </p>

<p>If we go to 1 Corinthians 3, it says in 1 Corinthians
3:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no
man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon
this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every man&rsquo;s
work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be
revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man&rsquo;s work of what sort it is.  </p>

<p>The works here are not referring to material things; it is
referring to people.  The &ldquo;gold, silver, precious stones&rdquo; are the elect.  The &ldquo;wood,
hay, stubble&rdquo; are the unsaved who have heard the Gospel.  Maybe they were
professed Christians, but they never truly became saved.  &ldquo;The day [<i>of</i>]&hellip;fire&rdquo;
will &ldquo;try every man&rsquo;s work&rdquo; to see what sort it was.  If you turn out to be &ldquo;wood,
hay, stubble,&rdquo; this means that you will be left behind and that you will be
burned up.  </p>

<p>So when 2 Peter 3:10 tells us that these works shall burn,
one thing that God has in view are those who were called.  They heard the
Gospel, but they never became born again.  </p>

<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:1, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?  </p>

<p>Paul was speaking to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Are you not my work
since I shared the Gospel with you?&rdquo;  Either they were built upon that
foundation, if they were truly saved, or they turned out to be &ldquo;wood, hay,
stubble.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is one thing that God has in view here in 2 Peter
3:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be
burned up.  </p>

<p>Look also at Isaiah 51:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax
old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner&hellip;  </p>

<p>So when God destroys the earth and the universe and burns
and melts it, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they that dwell therein shall die in like manner&hellip;  </p>

<p>When the universe is destroyed, it is gone forever.  That
will be it.  There will be nothing else.  So, too, with all of the unsaved who
will be left behind.  They are the works that God is referring to.  They will
be burned up and they will cease to exist forevermore.  </p>

<p>This is what we have learned.  Annihilation is the judgment
of God for mankind.  The Bible tells us, &ldquo;For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death.&rdquo; 
When a man died, all throughout history, on the day of his death, his soul
died.  His body died and he ceased to be.  He ceased to exist.  The only thing
left of him was the physical body that was put into the ground, or however it
was disposed of.  </p>

<p>This is the body that God will raise, but not back to a
conscious existence.  The unsaved dead will not be raised back to life, because
they are dead.  He will just raise up the dead body to expose it.  &ldquo;The earth
also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain&rdquo; is language
that God uses of this coming day to demonstrate the great shame that sin brings
upon a person who was made in the image of God but who dies like a beast.  </p>

<p>So on October 21, 2011, this is what is going to happen. 
The unsaved will be completely destroyed.  Some people are fine with this, so
they say.  They are fine with this.  They are okay with this.  Since there is not
a threat of eternal damnation over their heads, what is it to be eternally
destroyed and to experience God&rsquo;s wrath for just a few days?  </p>

<p>This is what people say.  From the perspective of not
actually being there, from being on this side of Judgment Day when this has not
yet occurred, people can bravely use this kind of language.  They can say, &ldquo;So? 
What do I care?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But when they will be there, when this day will have come
and God will have taken His people out of this world and they are someone who heard
these things repeatedly, again and again and again and again, they are not
going to be so fine with this.  If they are left behind, they will know what is
going on because everything else happened on May 21<sup>st</sup> exactly as God
said that it would.  There was an earthquake.  There was the rapture.  They
witnessed the day of the resurrection.  They will then know that they only have
five months left, if they can make it.  Then on that last day, that will be
it.  But this will be a miserable, miserable time of great sorrow, tremendous
sorrow.  </p>

<p>Have you ever thought that you should have done something
that you did not do?  This upsets you to the point where you could just kick
yourself.  You ask yourself, &ldquo;Why did I miss this opportunity?&rdquo;  Well, you will
be able to think of this times a million, because now is the day of salvation;
but at that time, no more.  </p>

<p>There are many like &ldquo;the rich man&rdquo; who are now enjoying the
things of this life.  It will not be until they will be in the torment, like
the rich man was, when the one overwhelming desire will come to them for a drop
of water.  They will also desire Lazarus, that poor beggar.  The last time that
the rich man saw him, he was a diseased beggar with sores and the dogs were
licking his wounds.  Yet, like the rich man, their cry will be, &ldquo;Let Lazarus
dip that diseased and filthy finger of his in a drop of water and come and
apply it to my tongue, because I am tormented in this flame.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is a good and vivid illustration of someone who is now
in their right mind.  Now they have sense.  Now they know that everything that they
had heard was true.  Now they believe God.  Now they believe the Bible.  Now
they want the Gospel.  Now they want that opportunity for salvation.  </p>

<p>What will be the answer?  It will not be possible.  The
Bible says, &ldquo;There is a great gulf fixed.&rdquo;  God is the One who set this gulf,
and the door will be closed.  But the rich man can see Lazarus in &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is pointing to all of those who are here on earth. 
They will not literally or physically be able to see the people of God, but
they will have seen them go up and they will know where they went.  They went
to Heaven.  All of God&rsquo;s people went to be with the Lord and they are in Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom, and so there is no possibility after this for any salvation.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #2:</i>  </b>How does Romans 1:18-21 fit in
with the doctrine of election?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>Romans 1:18-21 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because
that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed <i>it </i>unto
them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even </i>his eternal
power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they
knew God, they glorified <i>him </i>not as God, neither were thankful; but
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  </p>

<p>How this fits in with election is that God can change a
person.  Man, naturally, is in the situation that we read about in Romans
1:18:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who <span class="underline">hold</span> the truth in
unrighteousness;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;hold&rdquo; is like &ldquo;suppress.&rdquo;  The truth, for
instance, is being declared by the heavens, as God writes in Psalm 19, &ldquo;The heavens
declare the glory of God&hellip;day unto day uttereth speech.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So even though it is obvious that there had to be a Creator
who created the universe and that the very existence of the heavens and the
universe testifies to everyone in the world that there is a God, people developed
the doctrine or the teaching of evolution, which goes contrary to what the
Bible teaches.  The Bible teaches that God spoke and created the world, and the
Bible is very detailed about how God did this.  In spite of this, the doctrine
or teaching of evolution is produced.  </p>

<p>We can expect that in a world of this many, there would be a
few foolish people who would present an idea like this.  But the amazing thing
is that so many people from around the world, intelligent people, brilliant people
in some cases, put forth this idea of evolution and then this becomes fact,
even though, at best, this is a very poor theory.  </p>

<p>So the theory of evolution becomes a fact.  Colleges wind up
teaching it, schools teach it, and so on.  It has become an accepted fact to
the world that we began millions or billions of years ago and that everything
has been evolving ever since, even though, if you really look at it, this is
just stupid.  </p>

<p>It is idiotic to think, first of all, that when you ask the
question to people who hold to evolution, &ldquo;Where did that initial and beginning
substance come from?&rdquo; they have no answer.  They have no answer, whether they
call it the Big Bang or the ooze or whatever it was that was in the beginning. 
Where did it come from?  </p>

<p>They do not have an answer because, finally, they would have
to say, &ldquo;It was something eternal.&rdquo;  This is the only solution to the question,
&ldquo;Where did the stuff originally come from that exploded,&rdquo; or whatever the
latest add-on to the theory is, &ldquo;and became this world and this universe? 
Where did that come from?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So they just try to push this further and further back. 
They used to say that the age of the earth was millions of years old, and then
it was hundreds of millions, now it is billions.  This is because their
solution to this dilemma is to push it as far back as possible.  They could
even go back trillions of years if they wanted to; but at some point, when they
get to that beginning, what was there?  </p>

<p>The answer would have to be that there was eternal matter. 
This is the only answer that they could come to, but they avoid this by saying,
&ldquo;We do not know.  We have not figured that out yet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, should they not figure this part out before they do
the rest of the theory?  Should they not know the very beginning point of the
theory and how it could have happened, and then build from there?  </p>

<p>This is like someone who calls themselves a Christian
without having Christ as their foundation.  This is an extremely shaky belief. 
</p>

<p>We look around us, we look at ourselves, we look at our
fellowman, and we see very complex creatures.  If only one creature developed
in the way that they say that it did, like an insect, the tiniest of creatures,
if just one of these creatures could have evolved, this would be astronomical
as far as a possibility.  But to take millions of creatures and then to
consider mankind on top of all of this, and then to say that all of this
happened by chance, this goes beyond the realm of possibility.  </p>

<p>There was a secular scientist whom I found on the web who
was not a creationist or a believer, but he said that he did not believe in
evolution.  He gave the analogy that this would be like a tornado ripping
through a junkyard and in its aftermath leaving behind a perfectly formed
airplane or a car or a train&mdash;whatever you would want to put there.  He used a Boeing
747 airplane as an example.  Plus, everything would be working&mdash;the seatbelts
would work, the lights would come on, there would be a &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo; sign;
everything would work.  </p>

<p>Who believes this?  Who believes that a tornado could rip
through a junkyard and produce anything worthwhile?  Let the example even be an
aeronautical junkyard with a lot of plane parts.  Who really believes that a
tornado or any kind of cataclysmic event could go through a junkyard and form
an airplane?  </p>

<p>What is more complicated, a human being or an airplane?  How
about something even simpler, like a little boxcar that is used in a Soap Box
Derby?  Can anything be formed by a tornado into something constructive,
something that we would look at and see that it was something that required
intelligence to have its pieces put together?  </p>

<p>The truth is that we could have a tornado go through a
junkyard a billion times and never once would it form a working car or airplane
or anything like this.  Never once; this is not possible. </p>

<p>This is why evolution is so ridiculous, and so the only
answer as to why so many smart people hold to this is because they have a
prejudice.  They have within themselves a desire that there be no God, a desire
that there especially be no God of the Bible.  </p>

<p>This is what God is talking about when He says that people &ldquo;[<i>suppress</i>]
the truth in unrighteousness.&rdquo;  They just do not get into many of these
questions.  They do not bother asking very important questions about a teaching
that they are receiving, like the teaching of evolution.  God, who knows man,
knows that this is the case deep-down within.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Romans 1:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for
God hath showed <i>it </i>unto them. For the invisible things of him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made, <i>even </i>his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without
excuse:  </p>

<p>It is no excuse when someone says that they are agnostic or
an atheist and that they therefore do not believe that May 21<sup>st</sup> is
Judgment Day.  This is no excuse, because they should believe.  They should
believe and know that there is a God.  If they do not, they are not being
honest; because, deep-down, they know it.  This is what the Bible tells us.  </p>

<p>We know.  Man knows due to the testimony of the creation
itself and the witness of God as He has written the Law on their hearts and
given man a conscience.  People know.  They know and yet they have a preference
to remain in the darkness rather than to be in the light.  </p>

<p>If there is no God, then there is no Bible.  If there is no
Bible, then there is no Law.  If there is no Law, then there is no breaking of
the Law.  If there is no breaking of the Law, then they can live a life without
concern.  If they are not a lawbreaker, then there is no penalty, there is no
punishment, there is no wrath of God.  People desire to live this way and a
teaching like evolution supports this kind of life.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #3:</i>  </b>What is the significance of the
children in 2 Kings 2:23-24?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We read in 2 Kings
2:23-24:    </p>

<p class="verse">And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him,
and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned
back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of JEHOVAH. And there
came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of
them.  </p>

<p>There is significance with there being forty-two little
children.  These are representative of those who would identify with God but who
are not saved.  In other words, this identifies with those in the church.  </p>

<p>Here, Elisha, a prophet of God, is traveling to Bethel, the
house of God.  These children come out of the city and start mocking him.  This
is God&rsquo;s doing, and so God moves Elisha to pronounce this upon them.  Then two
she bears come out of the woods and tear the children apart.  The number two
would be representing the church under the rule of Satan at this time.  </p>

<p>What is Satan doing with those in the churches and
congregations?  He is certainly not helping them.  He is not delivering them at
all.  He is destroying them.  This is why this points to our day of great
tribulation.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #4:</i>  </b>Who are the locusts a picture of
in Revelation 9:3-5?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We read in Revelation 9:3-5: 
</p>

<p class="verse">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was
commanded them [<i>or it has been said</i>] that they should not hurt the grass
of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men
which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given
that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months:
and their torment <i>was </i>as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a
man.  </p>

<p>These locusts are a picture of the true believers.  On that
day, on May 21<sup>st</sup> when He takes His people up and out of this world
and brings them into Heaven, God will deal a deadly blow to those left behind. 
This will result in five months of torment and incredible sorrow for everyone
who was not taken up and who is still here in this world.  </p>

<p>As far as &ldquo;they should not hurt the grass of the earth,
neither any green thing,&rdquo; this action of God in bringing His people to Heaven is
not designed in any way to hurt a child of God, not in any way.  No matter how
you look at this, this is not designed to harm the true believer.  This has
been designed by God as the beginning of Judgment Day, which is the battle of
Armageddon.  God will use this as a sword towards the enemy, all of those who
are unsaved.  This is why they are able to be tormented for the five months.  </p>

<p>This is one of those verses that helped us to understand the
period of time from May 21<sup>st</sup> through October 21<sup>st</sup>.  This
was a perfect fit.  We came to the knowledge of the end of the great
tribulation and that the full 23 years would end on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p>This is going back years, but we knew that the Feast of
Tabernacles/Ingathering had to play a part in the end of the world.  However,
there was a gap.  You might also remember that for awhile we thought that the
Feast of Tabernacles would end on October 20<sup>th</sup>.  It was after being
corrected and the end of the Feast of Tabernacles was nudged over by one day to
October 21<sup>st</sup> that the five months could be clearly seen.  Then it
all came together.  </p>

<p>Once we understood time perfectly, then judgment fell into
place.  This is when we realized that God begins judgment on May 21<sup>st</sup>
while people are still on this earth.  Then we began to understand that God&rsquo;s
wrath would be on those remaining on this earth, not in hell.  His wrath would
not be upon man in a place called &ldquo;hell.&rdquo;  It would be upon mankind who are
left behind.  This is where there will be &ldquo;weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo; 
This is where there will be torment or this incredible sorrow.  </p>

<p>This verse then fit and then we saw the other verses that
had references to five months.  All of these other verses were teaching a
certain aspect and perspective of these five months, and so this is where we
are now.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #5 is a question that came from the EBF
website:</i>  </b>I heard about May 21<sup>st</sup> from a friend.  I am
worried.  Before I heard this, I had a dream not two weeks ago that the world
would end soon.  I did not take this seriously, but it felt so real that I woke
up really scared and quickly said to myself that it was just a dream.  Thank
you.  I will tell people about this.     </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We have to be careful,
because dreams cannot give us true insight.  We cannot trust dreams nor can we
trust our feelings.  </p>

<p>I remember seeing one of the news reports on a Family Radio
billboard that was up in an American city.  They went out right to the
billboard and asked people what they thought about the billboard since it said
that the Lord was coming on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  This one young man said, &ldquo;I
have a bad feeling about this.  I have a really bad feeling that this might
happen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Lord can work with people however He wants to work with
people, but one thing we can know is that Judgment Day is not going to happen
because of how someone feels.  We know that this is not going to happen because
someone had a bad dream.  This is going to happen because the Bible says that
this is going to happen, and the Bible is much more absolute and trustworthy.  </p>

<p>If we are going to worry about something, worry because it
is something that the Word of God is telling us.  If we are going to be
concerned, be concerned for this reason; because God&rsquo;s Word is true and
faithful and trustworthy in every way.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #6 is a question that came from the EBF
website:</i>  </b>(This question is from Roanoke, Virginia.)  If you really
believe that the end of the world will happen on May 21, 2011, why do the vehicles that you use here in Roanoke have state tags that expire the end of June
2011?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>I tell you, people are
watching.  People are watching and they are looking for the slightest thing to
point out.  </p>

<p>When you get your car license tags renewed, and in this case
this would have been done in June of 2010, the tags are renewed for one year. 
This means that they would have been renewed to June of 2011.  This is how most
state governments operate when they assign licenses and tags.  </p>

<p>This reminds me of people who have been complaining about
Family Radio renewing their broadcast license.  Maybe their new license went a
couple of years beyond 2011; but do you know how something like this works?  I
do not know how this particularly works.  It could be that you renew and you
get a period of three, four, or five years upon each renewal.  </p>

<p>These things should not be the focus.  The focus should be
that we are running out of time.  We are running out of time, so you can get
out a magnifying glass and look at license plates, or you can use your time
wisely and get hold of a book like <i>We Are Almost There!</i> and get out your
Bible and read it and pray to God for mercy.  These other things are of no
importance.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #7:</i>  </b>On Judgment Day, there will be
no mercy and no grace.  When I read a passage in relation to God&rsquo;s judgment,
for example like Genesis 7:18-24, I try to get an idea of God&rsquo;s relationship to
mankind during this time.  Also, what will the relationship be during this time,
for example, between a mother and her children?  I have been trying to do a
study on this.  I am trying to just find more information on Judgment Day
itself.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>Let us start in Genesis
7:16.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and JEHOVAH shut him in.  </p>

<p>This is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of Noah&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  This is after seven days when the Lord shut the door of the Ark.  Noah
did not shut the door.  God shut the door and we know that this was a picture
of salvation.  </p>

<p>Christ is the door.  He is the entryway into Heaven.  As
long as the door is open, potentially, from our perspective, anyone could enter
in through God&rsquo;s mercy and become saved.  But after the door shuts, no one will
be able to get in.  They might try going up some other way, but they will not
be able to get into Heaven.  They must go through the door.  There is none
other way.  </p>

<p>So after telling Noah, &ldquo;For yet seven days, and I will cause
it to rain upon the earth,&rdquo; historically, seven days later the flood came, the
eight souls were in the ark with the animals and God shut the door.  This was a
picture of May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>It is not a small thing that May 21, 2011 is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of the Hebrew calendar.  Just think about
this sometimes.  Meditate on this.  May 21<sup>st</sup> is the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day, a full 23 years from when the great tribulation began that ushered in the
end of the church age in 1988, and these things were worked out completely
apart from the 7,000 years in relation to Noah&rsquo;s flood.  These things were
worked out years ago.  </p>

<p>So there had been the question of these five months in
between May 21<sup>st</sup> and October 21<sup>st</sup> when we got to the last
day of the Feast of Tabernacles.  When God nudged over that day from October 20<sup>th</sup>
to October 21<sup>st</sup>, then the five months or the 153 days of our
calendar could be clearly seen.  </p>

<p>At this point, God was locking this in and confirming this
with an infallible proof that everything that had been developed with the
timeline was correct.  It could not fit any other way.  May 21<sup>st</sup>,
which is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of the Hebrew
calendar, fits perfectly with what follows here in Genesis 7 when the flood
began.  </p>

<p>It says in Genesis 7:17-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. And the
waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went
upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
earth; and all the high hills, that <i>were </i>under the whole heaven, were
covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,
and every man: All in whose nostrils <i>was </i>the breath of life, of all that
<i>was </i>in the dry <i>land, </i>died. And every living substance was
destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the
creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the
earth: and Noah only remained <i>alive, </i>and they that <i>were </i>with him
in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
</p>

<p>What is 150 days if we were to relate this to months?  This
would be five thirty-day months.  This is exactly true.  </p>

<p>Look at Genesis 8:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. And the ark
rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the
mountains of Ararat.  </p>

<p>The door was shut on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  One hundred and fifty days later was the 17<sup>th</sup> day of 7<sup>th</sup>
month, which is just as we see in the time span from May 21<sup>st</sup> to
October 21<sup>st</sup>.  It is very easy to see this five-month period of Noah&rsquo;s
calendar from the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month to the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month.  </p>

<p>So, amazingly, God has five months in view in Genesis 7
after He shut the door.  Then the waters were triumphant; &ldquo;the waters
prevailed.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We read in Genesis 7:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed&hellip;  </p>

<p>Did you hear this several times?  It says this also in
Genesis 7:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed exceedingly&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 7:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.</p>

<p>Revelation 9 speaks of five months of torment.  So what does
it mean that the waters prevailed for five months?  What are the waters
referring to?  They are referring to the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Go to 1 Peter 3.  1 Peter 3:18-19 says:   </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
prison;  </p>

<p>This is strange language, but we might have some &ldquo;spirits in
prison&rdquo; right here.  There might be some here who are in the dungeon of sin and
wrapped about by the chords of their own iniquity.  Satan is the one who is
actually operating in them because they are &ldquo;children of disobedience,&rdquo; as
Ephesians says.  This is what this verse is referring to.  Christ or the Spirit
preached to sinners still in their sins, to &ldquo;spirits in prison.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When did this happen?  We read in 1 Peter 3:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which <span class="underline">sometime</span> were disobedient&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;sometime&rdquo; is better understood as &ldquo;aforetime&rdquo; or &ldquo;in
times past.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which [<i>aforetime</i>] were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  </p>

<p>The flood water saved eight souls.  What saves people?  What
saves people is the Word of God and God likens the Word to water.  This is what
saves.  </p>

<p>God has been telling and telling people something that we
have known for some time but are actually seeing come to pass, which is that
His intention is to warn the whole world.  He is going to do this, but I do not
know how.  We are seeing a lot of progress in this area, but there is still the
nation of China where we do not have much advertising.  Of course, Family Radio
reaches China.  We know that God is going to do this.  We just do not know, in
every case, how He is going to do this.  </p>

<p>So people are being forewarned that this day is coming. 
Everyone is being forewarned, which is a great blessing.  It is a great
blessing to know of this in advance, whether you are saved or unsaved.  Even if
you remain unsaved, this is a great blessing.  It says in Hebrews 11 that Isaac
blessed both Jacob and Esau &ldquo;concerning things to come.&rdquo;  It is a blessing to
have this information.  </p>

<p>God is telling the world that Judgment Day is May 21, 2011.  The response of the people in the world who have been living their lives
paying no attention except to mock at the churches&mdash;and today the churches have
become a mockery because they are under the wrath of God&mdash;is to live their lives
completely apart from the Bible and the Gospel.  Judgment Day is a message that
comes right from the Bible.  They spent their lives blowing off the church,
which is a good thing in our day, but they also blew off God and the Bible,
which is not a good thing.  They went about their lives to have as much fun as
they could and to obtain as many things as they could.  </p>

<p>Well, now, these people are being confronted with the
Gospel.  The people of the world are seeing these billboards.  They cannot be
missed.  There are also other forms of advertising, like signs on park benches
or on buses or on cars.  People are wearing T-shirts.  </p>

<p>With everything that God&rsquo;s people are doing, the people of
the world, people who have managed quite well without ever having anything to
do with the Bible, are being confronted with this knowledge.  They are hearing
this message and a lot of people are angry that this kind of message is
reaching their eyes and their ears.  They do not like this at all.  </p>

<p>So we are getting all kinds of notes from people in the
churches as well as from people in the world.  They are reading the tracts. 
They are hearing about this and they are mocking, mocking, mocking, as they say
things like, &ldquo;See you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Do you want to make a bet?&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>If I brought in a list, you would be amazed at some of the
things that people say.  They say these things because they just do not believe
this.  Naturally, they do not believe it.  Man does not believe the truth of
the Bible, and it is not because things have not been plainly stated.  The
Bible plainly states that God created the world.  Does man believe this?  No. 
So if there was a verse that plainly said that May 21, 2011 would be Judgment Day, man would not believe this either.  </p>

<p>This is not a matter of not being able to prove this; this
is just a matter of unbelief.  The church is probably the greatest offender,
because they should know better.  They should be willing to check these things
out in the Bible to see if they are so.  Instead, they casually and
superficially go to a verse like, &ldquo;But of that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth
no man,&rdquo; and they stop there.  This is as far as their study into this matter
goes.  They are not going to dig any deeper.  </p>

<p>All of this behavior is a rejection, but it is not a
rejection of you or of me or of Family Radio.  This is a rejection of God.  God
is graciously, kindly, and compassionately warning people.  Everyone will be
warned, and yet many people are blowing this off.  They are dismissing this and
ignoring this.  They are paying this no mind.  </p>

<p>Okay; they can laugh now, but God says in the Bible that
there will come a day when &ldquo;the day of their calamity&rdquo; will be upon them.  Then
He will laugh.  This is what He says in His Word.  On that day, He will laugh
at their calamity.  This day is May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>So God in Genesis 7 is making a point of emphasizing that &ldquo;the
waters prevailed&rdquo; for five months.  It says, &ldquo;The waters prevailed exceedingly,&rdquo;
and this is speaking of His Word.  The Bible will be glorified in the eyes of
all the world at that time.  This is what He is saying.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.   </p>
