<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>Some of the responses that we are
getting are not very good.  There can be some reviling and things of this sort;
but we can look at it this way, at least they are responding to the Gospel, maybe
for the first time.  A lot of people are being confronted with the Gospel, with
the information about Judgment Day; and so I think that any kind of a response
is good.  Anything that they would contact us with means that this is on their
minds and that they are troubled by this.  We have seen notes that people have
written that are the size of a short story, just to tell us how ridiculous and
foolish they think this is, and yet they spent a lot of time in typing it out
and sending it to us.  This is because it is on their minds.  This is on a lot
of people&rsquo;s minds increasingly as we get closer to May 21<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #1 is from </i></b><b><i>Italy</i></b><b><i>
from someone who visited the website:</i>  </b>The end cannot arrive on May
21.  The Bible says that the end of the world will not occur until the
conversion of the Jews.  I refer you to Romans 11:25-26.  I look forward to
your comments.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>Let us go to Romans 11.  We read in
Romans 11:25:    </p>

<p class="verse">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here is another mystery that God is talking about.  This is
the nature of the Bible.  The Bible itself is a mystery.  What is a mystery?  A
mystery is something that is hidden, is it not?  It is something that is
unknown.  It is something that we have to figure out.  It is like a puzzle, and
this is the nature of the Bible.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Corinthians 4.  It says in 1 Corinthians 4:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
stewards of the mysteries of God.  </p>

<p>We are &ldquo;stewards of the mysteries,&rdquo; because this is
referring to the Bible itself.  </p>

<p>Then 1 Corinthians 4:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
faithful.  </p>

<p>So we have to be a faithful steward of the mystery, which is
the Bible.  This is why it is very important that we do understand these things
that God is opening up at this time, things that He had sealed up until our
day, things that He had &ldquo;sealed till the time of the end.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Part of this mystery was revealed in the first century when
it was made known to Paul that the Gentiles would come in.  This was part of
the mystery.  In this case, God made this known.  There are many things that He
did not make known, things that He stored up until our day.  </p>

<p>So it says in Romans 11:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is
happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles [<i>or nations</i>] be
come in. And so all Israel shall be saved&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can understand this word &ldquo;so&rdquo; to be translated as &ldquo;in
this manner&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">And [<i>this is the way</i>] all Israel shall be saved&hellip;  </p>

<p>Many churches think because of this verse and a few others
that God has a great plan for Israel, that nothing is going to happen in
relation to God destroying this world until He saves all Israel.  Because of
this, many have a keen watch or a watchful eye on Israel over in the Middle
 East.  They are just waiting for the Jewish nation to turn to Christ in what
they think is the fulfillment of this Scripture, as well as some other
Scriptures.  </p>

<p>This is not going to happen.  Israel has been a nation since
1948 and they have never given the slightest indication that they are turning
towards Christ in any way.  They are not going to, because this is not
referring to them.  This is referring to the &ldquo;Israel of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Earlier in Romans, in Romans 2, it says in Romans 2:28-29:  </p>

<p class="verse">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <i>is that </i>circumcision,
which is outward in the flesh: But he <i>is </i>a Jew, which is one inwardly;
and circumcision <i>is that </i>of the heart, in the spirit, <i>and </i>not in
the letter; whose praise <i>is </i>not of men, but of God.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s definition of a true Jew.  It is not someone
who is circumcised and who is a descendant of Abraham.  Yes; they are a Jew
physically.  Yes; they are a descendant of Israel.  But God also has a
spiritual Israel who is made up of all of the people of the world.  As soon as
someone becomes saved, they become a Jew, because God circumcises their heart. 
He cuts off their sin, and so they are of spiritual Israel.  </p>

<p>It says in Galatians 6:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing&hellip;  </p>

<p>If you are a Jew, this does not mean anything, as far as
salvation is concerned.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision&hellip;  </p>

<p>If you are a Gentile, this does not mean anything.  Nobody
has preference.  Everyone stands in the same position before God.  We stand
before Him as a sinner in need of salvation.  </p>

<p>Here is what means something, as it continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but a new creature.  </p>

<p>This is what we become when God saves us.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Galatians 6:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <i>be </i>on
them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.  </p>

<p>This is the Israel that is in focus in Romans 11.  </p>

<p>Let us read this now with this understanding.  We read in
Romans 11:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;blindness in part is happened to Israel&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can understand this to be referring to the Jewish
nation.  They do not see Christ.  They do not see their need of Him as their
Saviour.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;until the fulness of the Gentiles [<i>nations</i>] be come in. And
so [<i>in this manner</i>] all Israel shall be saved&hellip;  </p>

<p>When God saves the last of His elect, whether it is a Jew,
which it could be, or whether it is a person in India or China, a Gentile,
since it does not matter what nation they are from, upon their salvation, they
become part of the &ldquo;Israel of God.&rdquo;  It is in this manner that &ldquo;all Israel,&rdquo; all
of the spiritual Jews whom God saves from around the world, will come in.  </p>

<p>So this is not a hindrance at all; but if you are looking at
this in relation to the nation of Israel in the Middle East, then, yes, you are
thinking that May 21<sup>st</sup> cannot be Judgment Day, because they are not
all saved.  They are not all saved, and yet this is a wrong understanding of
what the Bible is teaching.  The Bible is not teaching that they will all be
saved.  </p>

<p>So there is no problem with God ending the world on May 21<sup>st</sup>
in relation to the &ldquo;Israel of God,&rdquo; because we know that He is going to save
each and every one of His elect people.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #2 came from the EBF website:</i>  </b>May 21
has been weighing heavily on my heart.  I am struggling with this.  Was Mr.
Camping not sure about 1994, and yet it did not happen?  Also, I know that we
are to warn the unsaved of the impending disaster forthcoming, but what is the
importance of knowing the exact day?  I just do not feel comfortable with
this.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>Yes; there was a book
called <i>1994?</i> that Mr. Camping wrote.  I think that this was published in
1992 and it had a question mark on it.  </p>

<p>A lot of people like to bring up failed predictions from the
past.  They say that we were not right in 1994 and then they say that there have
been hundreds of failed predictions.  They give varying amounts of the number
of failed predictions and I do not know what the exact number is, but they
indicate that a lot of dates were given and that they were all wrong.  They
then therefore conclude that the date of May 21<sup>st</sup> has to be wrong.  </p>

<p>Is this correct?  Is this right reasoning?  Is there a
problem with this?  Yes; there is.  There are a lot of problems with this type
of reasoning.  </p>

<p>We cannot base reasoning on those who have been wrong in the
past.  What about those who tried to fly for centuries?  They were all wrong
and many of them ended up in a gully with broken wings and with some of them
even dying.  </p>

<p>Were others therefore not to try to fly?  What about the
Wright Brothers?  Were they never to try to attempt flight?  If they had
listened to the people who use this kind of logic, we would not be able to fly
all over the world like we are able to do today since this was an impossibility
for centuries.  </p>

<p>We have the same situation with vaccines.  There were
diseases, like Polio, which no one had a cure for.  Many tried and failed.  Jonas
Salk is best known for his discovery and development of the first polio
vaccine.  Louis Pasteur came up with the first vaccine for other illnesses.  </p>

<p>A lot of people attempted to cure many diseases and, of
course, there were many previous failures; but if we follow this faulty
reasoning, they should have just stopped.  Should they have not continued with
cancer research in our day?  Should they have just put an end to this?  Maybe
they should have just stopped trying to discover a cure for cancer since they
had never been able to do this before.  </p>

<p>When the reasoning is that people have been wrong before
and, therefore, people are always going to get it wrong, we see the problem
when we apply this kind of thinking to just about any other field of endeavor. 
This reasoning does not work in the field of science, it does not work in the
medical field, and it does not work with inventions.  They all realize that
past mistakes or failures put them on the road to the solution.  Every solution
normally has a history of failure, and then there comes a breakthrough.  </p>

<p>I am just using this example, because this has nothing to do
with how we understand Biblical doctrine.  It is not like we examined all of
the past failures and finally came up with a solution.  We did not do this.  We
are just simply at the time of the end when God is opening up these things.  What
we understand is correct.  This information is correct, it is faithful, and it
is going to happen.   </p>

<p>So what happened in the past has no bearing on the
information that God has opened up at this time.  We have no relationship to
any of those people, except for Mr. Camping&rsquo;s 1994 prediction.  There are still
some people around who did hear of this and believe it.  But there is a big
difference when a question mark is put on a topic like before and what we understand
today.  I can surely see the difference.  Can you?  </p>

<p>Do you know what bothers and angers people so much and
disturbs them a great deal?  It is because of the definitiveness of this
warning.  It is the absoluteness of what we are saying.  We say, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 - Judgment Day!&rdquo; and then we put an exclamation point at the end of it.  This
is a big difference from a book called <i>1994?</i> with a question mark at the
end of it.  The two just cannot be compared.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #3 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Could you
compare Matthew 12:39 with Matthew 16:1-12?  I was listening to a recent &ldquo;Open
Forum&rdquo; program on Family Radio when someone asked whether or not there was
going to be another banquet.  Mr. Camping said that there would not be anymore
banquets because he was continuing to study about particular &ldquo;signs&rdquo; that might
be at the end.  What is the difference between &ldquo;a wicked and adulterous
generation&rdquo; seeking after a sign and looking in the Bible and seeing the
signs?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>It says in Matthew 12:39:     </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but
the sign of the prophet Jonas:  </p>

<p>And we read in Matthew 16:1-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
him that he would show them a sign from heaven. He answered and said unto them,
When it is evening, ye say, <i>It will be </i>fair weather: for the sky is red.
And in the morning, <i>It will be </i>foul weather to day: for the sky is red
and lowering. O <i>ye </i>hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but
can ye not <i>discern </i>the signs of the times? A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of
the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. And when his disciples were
come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</p>

<p>As far as signs, Jesus says here in Matthew 16:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas [<i>Jonah</i>]&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Today we do say that there are indicators or signs, such as Israel
becoming a nation again, the falling away of the churches and the apostasy, the
homosexual activity in the world, and there are others.  </p>

<p>Actually, I think another sign is what we read in Matthew
24:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.  </p>

<p>This is what we are seeing.  We are seeing a multiplication
of the information about May 21, 2011 being Judgment Day going around the world
in a way that the world has never witnessed before.  It was never possible
before and, obviously, it never happened before because the end never came in
the past.  This is what is going on now with the worldwide network of Family
Radio, with all of the advertising, and with all of the believers who are out
there bringing the Gospel.  Just about every nation is receiving this witness. 
Before the end, every nation will; &ldquo;and then shall the end come.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So there are signs, but they are all in the Bible, as you
made reference.  This is where God wants us to look.  We are not to look for
outward miracles, which is what the Jews wanted Christ to do.  They wanted Him
to prove Himself with something that they could see physically and visibly. 
This is the difference.  </p>

<p>God is the One who is giving these indicators today through
His Word.  He is the One who is opening up the understanding of His people to
see them, not physically but with spiritual eyes.  </p>

<p>For instance, if you look at Matthew 24:15-16, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken
of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him
understand:) Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;see&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;know.&rdquo;  When we
know this, when God shows this to us through His Word, the Bible, then we see that
Satan is in the churches and that it is time to get out and to &ldquo;flee&rdquo;; but this
is all spiritual understanding.  It is understanding that we get from the
Bible.  It is not like we can look at a church and actually see with our eyes
an &ldquo;abomination of desolation.&rdquo;  We cannot do this, but spiritually we can.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #4 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Maybe you
could go into a little more detail about 1994.  There are people here who might
like to understand the meaning of the number 23 in relation to the 2300 days
and the 23 years.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>The book <i>1994? </i>was
a study that Mr. Camping did that was published in 1992.  I had the book and I
read it.  I think that I still have a copy.  You can find in this book the year
2011 mentioned several times.  In one case, Mr. Camping said that we would
normally expect the Great Tribulation to be 23 years, from 1998 to 2011, but
God had said that the days would be shortened, as it says in Matthew 24:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
be saved: but for the elect&rsquo;s sake those days shall be shortened.  </p>

<p>The way that Mr. Camping understood this was that at the
beginning of the Great Tribulation, the Gospel light in the churches was going
out.  It was getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.  He thought that by the time
of the end of the first 2300 evening/morning period, which was 1988 to 1994,
the Gospel would be completely out.  If this were to extend for the full 23
years, &ldquo;no flesh,&rdquo; or God&rsquo;s people, the elect, would not be saved.  </p>

<p>So the mistake that was made was applying this verse to the
23 years and saying that even though we normally expected the Great Tribulation
period to last this long, it would be shortened to 2300 evening/mornings, which
fell in September of 1994.  Of course, once we passed this date, it was obvious
that this was not what God had in mind by the shortening of the days.  </p>

<p>We now understand that the days were shortened &ldquo;for the
elect&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; who were out there in the world, because God began the latter
rain in September of 1994.  Yet the character of those 2300 days, if it would
have continued in the world, would have virtually allowed no one to become
saved.  The elect would not have been saved, so God shortened this for the
world, the nations, but He kept this going in the church.  </p>

<p>There has really been no difference for the churches from
1988 until the present and there will be no difference in the churches until May 21, 2011.  They are still under a famine of hearing.  No one is being saved in the
churches; but &ldquo;for the elect&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; out in the world, God did shorten the
days, and then He poured out His Spirit &ldquo;the second time to recover the remnant
of his people,&rdquo; to save His elect.  This is how we understand this.  </p>

<p>So it was this verse in Matthew 24 that led Mr. Camping to
assume that the Great Tribulation would last six years and about 4 months to
get to the 2300 evening/mornings, but we have learned a lot more since then. 
Again, there is no question mark on May 21<sup>st</sup>, because God has
confirmed this in many ways.  </p>

<p>Some people hear about the book <i>1994?</i> and then they
dismiss everything after that point.  They say that since he was wrong about
that, then he must also be wrong about this.  No; not necessarily.  We were
just talking about how failures can lead to the solution.  </p>

<p>What people need to recognize is that back in 1992 when this
book was published, there was a lot of information about the falling away of
the churches, as well as the 23-year Great Tribulation period, that was yet to
be understood.  Even so, we understand now that the dates that had been listed were
very correct.  For example, 23 years added to the day before Pentecost in 1988
leads us to May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>So in bringing up this subject of 1994, we realize that all
of this has been in place since 1992, which is how many years ago?  That was 19
years ago, and we now find that 7,000 years from the flood falls on 2011 and
that the 8400<sup>th</sup> day, that full 23<sup>rd</sup> year, falls on May 21,
which also happens to be the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of
the Hebrew calendar.  </p>

<p>This was not prearranged.  This was not tampered with in any
way.  This has been in place since 1992.  Think about the fact that God has
shown us that May 21<sup>st</sup> is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  Then from that day, the Bible speaks of five months of torment.  </p>

<p>Actually, all of this just confirms that these dates are
correct.  No one could have thrown all of these dates together and tried to
make them come out this way.  We did not know what to do with them for awhile,
but now God as put His seal on this.  </p>

<p>So we can say with complete confidence that the Bible
guarantees that May 21, 2011 will be Judgment Day.  This is coming from God,
not Family Radio, not any individual.  This is coming from the Word of God, God&rsquo;s
voice.  He is the One who has confirmed this.  </p>

<p>This is something that God is matching the world against
finally.  The world is certain, absolutely certain, to the point that they can
guarantee that May 22<sup>nd</sup> will come without event.  </p>

<p>I do not know how many people have written to us and
guaranteed this in one way or another, or how many people whom we have met who
say, &ldquo;I will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.&rdquo;  They have a great confidence and
a great faith in the continuance of this world.  </p>

<p>So God in His wisdom has matched the confidence of the
world.  They are guaranteeing the 22<sup>nd</sup> and He is guaranteeing the 21<sup>st</sup>. 
Now it is a matter of whom we are going to trust and believe.  Are we going to
believe the world?  Can they tell us what is going to happen tomorrow?  Do they
know the end from the beginning like God does?  Are we going to believe the
church of our day, not the church of our fathers, a church which had some
truths and whom God was still with and blessing to some degree?  </p>

<p>The church of today bears no resemblance to the church of
the Reformation in the time of Luther and Knox and Calvin and Zwingli.  It
bears no resemblance.  As a matter of fact, the church of our day is wrong on
just about every point of doctrine imaginable.  They do not even know how God
saves people.  They do not know the judgment of God.  They do not know many,
many things; and yet they are standing in unison and saying that no man knows
the day or hour.  </p>

<p>This would not give me any comfort.  It should not give
anyone any comfort that they believe this so intensely.  Just look at the
source.  It is churches that have added to the Word of God and subtracted from
the Word of God.  Just about all of these churches have a works gospel for
salvation.  These are churches that teach contrary to the Bible on divorce, they
teach contrary to the Bible on women teaching, and on and on and on and on.  </p>

<p>So these churches are now going to guarantee their members
and anyone who will listen to them that May 22<sup>nd</sup> will come.  This is
not a very reliable source.  They are about as reliable as the world is,
because the world is in the church today; and so this should not give anybody
any comfort at all.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #5 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Could you
look at 1 Timothy 6:14-15?  In verse 15, it says that &ldquo;in his times he shall
show.&rdquo;  Is this referring to our day when He has shown us these things from the
Bible?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We read in 1 Timothy
6:14-16:    </p>

<p class="verse">That thou keep <i>this </i>commandment without spot,
unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: Which in his times
he shall show, <i>who is </i>the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings,
and Lord of lords; Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no
man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom <i>be </i>honour
and power everlasting. Amen.  </p>

<p>It is the Bible&rsquo;s plan to show us things at the end, and I
think that this could agree with this.  </p>

<p>Look at John, the Fourth Gospel, 16:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.  </p>

<p>This is Christ speaking to Christians.  Why could they not &ldquo;bear
them now&rdquo;?  What were the &ldquo;many things&rdquo; that He had to say?  </p>

<p>This had to do with the things that were &ldquo;sealed till the
time of the end.&rdquo;  He could not tell them these things in the first century. 
It would have been a burden for them, as well as for Christians throughout the
centuries, to have carried information about the exact day of judgment and
other things that God wanted sealed up for His own purposes, like the faith of
Christ and annihilation and these other teachings.  Mainly, He did not want to
burden the church with the end of the church age information and information
about Judgment Day when it would have been centuries later before these came to
be.  These things did not open up until the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and so He
says here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but ye cannot bear them now.  </p>

<p>He had many things to say, but they could not bear them.  At
the proper time, we would be able to bear them.  When this time came, He would
open up His Word and He would do this at the time of the end, which is where we
are.  </p>

<p>Then He says in verse 13, John 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
hear, <i>that </i>shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.  </p>

<p>Have we been shown &ldquo;things to come&rdquo;?  Yes; definitely.  </p>

<p>A lot of people read John 16 and they think that it is
referring to Acts 2 in relation to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but this
cannot be.  This is because He says that &ldquo;he will guide you into&rdquo; not just &ldquo;truth,&rdquo;
but &ldquo;into all truth.&rdquo;  The Holy Spirit who has come now will guide us into &ldquo;all
truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The church that we read about in Acts 2 was not guided &ldquo;into
all truth&rdquo; in any way.  Just look at the differing doctrines of the churches in
relation to baptism and how people are to be saved, and so forth.  Much of
their doctrines and teachings were wrong.  They had not been guided &ldquo;into all
truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God refers to a second outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the &ldquo;latter
rain.&rdquo;  What do we know of the character of the time in which we live?  We live
at the time when the Bible is being opened.  We are being guided &ldquo;into all
truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do we know everything?  No, but we will know everything that
God has measured out, everything that He wanted His people to know in its
fullness.  Even now we are learning about the possibility of a rolling
earthquake, which is answering a lot of questions.  This still needs to be
verified, but this looks like this is true.  </p>

<p>So He will guide us &ldquo;into all truth,&rdquo; and part of that truth
is that &ldquo;he will show us things to come.&rdquo;  We have definitely been shown this. 
We have been shown the future.  We have been given a glimpse into the future, a
future that the world is so interested in knowing about.  They engage in horoscopes
and in crystal balls and in Ouija boards, or whatever.  They are involved in
all of these types of things.  Psychic hotlines are an enormous business,
because people want to know what is going to happen to them tomorrow and in the
future.  We can know that all of these things are fake, because they are
certainly not seeing May 21<sup>st</sup> in any of these things.  God is the
only One and the only true source who does know the future and who can reveal
the future to us, and this is what He is doing.  </p>

<p>The way some people act, you would think that we are talking
about someone other than God.  They act as if it is an impossibility for Him to
hide information in His Word and to seal it up so that it could not be
understood until we got to the time of the end.  </p>

<p>Is this too hard for the Lord?  Is this beyond His ability? 
No; this is a simple thing.  Jesus told His disciples directly that He would go
to the cross and the events that would transpire in relation to this, and yet
they did not understand Him.  </p>

<p>People do not understand because it takes God to open the
Scriptures to their understanding.  This is what He is doing today.  This is
what He has done and is continuing to do.  The Holy Spirit - who has now come -
will guide us into all truth, and 1 Timothy 6:15 could relate to this.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #6 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>I have a
question concerning the words &ldquo;from&rdquo; and &ldquo;before.&rdquo;  When we went out on the
caravan last week in Pennsylvania, we had a little discussion about these two
words.  Did God pay for the sins of His elect before He created time, or did He
make this payment at the same time that the heavens and the earth were being
created?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>In relation to &ldquo;from&rdquo;
and &ldquo;before,&rdquo; we can look at Ephesians 1:4:    </p>

<p class="verse">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is what God is saying about choosing His elect.  Jesus
said, &ldquo;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So there is a decision being made in salvation.  There is a
matter of choosing, but it is not people who do the choosing.  It is not people
who choose Christ; it is Christ who chooses people.  This is the only free will
that the Bible knows about.  The only decision that can lead to salvation is
Christ&rsquo;s decision to save whom He will, and it was from before the foundation
of the world that He chose people.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Psalm 103:17.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the mercy of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>from everlasting to
everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children&rsquo;s
children;  </p>

<p>So the mercy of the Lord goes how far back?  It goes &ldquo;from
everlasting to everlasting.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We understand the future aspect of this, because the future
aspect is in relation to eternal life.  God&rsquo;s mercy is upon the sinner
eternally into the future.  But at what point did He grant this mercy?  At what
point did God die for sinners?  </p>

<p>Are we to say that He did this &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;?  Are we going
to get into this trouble again?  We used to say, &ldquo;In principle, Christ was
slain from before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  Or is God making a statement
of what He did &ldquo;from everlasting&rdquo;?  Is He saying, &ldquo;From everlasting, I have had
mercy upon you&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>The everlasting love that the Bible speaks of is an eternal
love, and so I do not think that there is any question about it being before
the foundation of the world when Jesus saved His people.  This is when He died
for them and paid the penalty for their sin.  Then He rose before the
foundation of the world, which is another issue.  </p>

<p>When He rose from the dead, He was &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the
Son of God.&rdquo;  It was the Son of God who created the world.  This means that all
of this had to have taken place prior to the creation of this world.  This
could not have been from the foundation.  If this had been simultaneous with
the creation of the world, He would not have been &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the
Son&rdquo; at that point; therefore, He had already risen from the dead.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #7 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Was the
6,000<sup>th</sup> year after creation a Jubilee year?  If this was the case,
would the 23 years leading up to the flood have been ample time to reach the
world with news of the coming flood?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>God did not institute
the Jubilee until the time that He gave the Law, and so I do not think that we
should try to put the Jubilee into focus at that time in any way.  This is a
good question, though.  Did Noah warn the whole world?  How did he warn the
whole world?  </p>

<p>First of all, the world at that time was probably only a
handful of a million people.  It was not like Noah had the task of warning
seven billion people.  God can even warn this many with relatively few people,
as He said that He would; and this is what He is doing in our day.  </p>

<p>In Noah&rsquo;s day, we know that God had Noah build an ark.  This
was a condemnation to the world.  This is one reason why the world does not want
to see a believer with &ldquo;Judgment Day&rdquo; written all over him &ndash; on his hat, on his
T-shirt, on his jacket.  We would wear socks with this warning on them if this
would get someone&rsquo;s attention.  It is just that the world is so hardened and
blind that it is almost like we have to walk around with neon lights on us for
them to notice this.  </p>

<p>This really is not a testimony that we are crazy.  This is a
testimony that the world is blind and that we are trying anything that is good
and right that we can in order to get their attention so that they will take
notice of this warning.  </p>

<p>In Hebrews 11:7, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is just exactly like us.  The Holy Spirit is telling us
of things to come, but we have not seen them yet.  God worked the same way with
Noah.  God says that Noah:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house&hellip;  </p>

<p>So we can see the grace of God in this, as well as the &ldquo;twoedged
sword,&rdquo; because we know that the Gospel is &ldquo;the savour of death unto death; and
to the other the savour of life unto life.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by the which&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the construction, preparation, and
completion of the ark.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by the which he condemned the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>The billboards that have been put up along I-95 are
condemning the world.  It is not just the church world that is aware of this
information.  The whole world is now being faced with the Gospel: Judgment Day
&ndash; May 21!   </p>

<p>How ever long it took Noah to build that ark, it was a witness
against the people of the world.  It was a witness that the flood was going to
happen.  It was a witness against them and against their sins.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that there was only a handful of a million who
all spoke the same language and who all lived on the same continent.  The
continents had not been divided as they would be in the days of Peleg.  This is
what made this task a lot easier.  People naturally congregate; they group
together.  </p>

<p>We know how people talk and how they can gossip.  What
better thing to laugh about than Noah?  They did not have the entertainment
that we have in our day.  They just had this crazy guy who was building an ark,
probably in his own backyard.  </p>

<p>Do you not think that this word got around?  Word got
around.  We are talking about a world that was maybe the size of Philadelphia. 
Has word gotten around in Philadelphia with the caravan going around just a few
times, with people handing out tracts, with a few billboards?  Now think of a
persistent witness by Noah for years and years and years and years.  Of course they
heard.  He was a preacher of righteousness and the ark did a lot of preaching. 
The construction of that boat did a lot of preaching to the people of that
day.  They all knew.  </p>

<p>Matthew 24:37-39 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe [<i>Noah</i>] <i>were, </i>so shall also
the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
that Noe [<i>Noah</i>] entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came,
and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.    </p>

<p>Some think that this is saying that the people of Noah&rsquo;s day
did not know anything about the flood, but this is not saying that.  They
dismissed it, they ignored it, they wrote it off, and so they did not know.  It
was a joke to them.  After all, how could anyone believe that the world was
going to end by a flood!  </p>

<p>Look at the reaction of the people today.  People do not
think that this is a real possibility.  They trust this world, they love this
world, and the ground is quite solid right now.  They think that it is
definitely going to be solid tomorrow and the day after and on May 22<sup>nd</sup>. 
</p>

<p>Well, God in His mercy just gave us another glimpse in Japan
of how foolish this trust is, even in normal times; but He is about to show
this to the whole world.  When this happens, then they will know.  Just like
when the waters started to fall in Noah&rsquo;s day, it was then that they knew. 
They put two and two together and realized that this was what Noah was warning
them about all along.  This is why it says that they &ldquo;knew not&rdquo; until the flood
came.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
