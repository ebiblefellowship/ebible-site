<p><b><i>Question #1 came from the EBF website:</i>  </b>So
what happens when you wake up on the 22<sup>nd</sup> and the 23<sup>rd</sup>?   </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>This same question has been stated in
many ways.  Many people want to know what we are going to do on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. 
What they are asking is, &ldquo;What are we going to do if nothing happens?  If this
day passes without event, then what?&rdquo;  They do not realize that there is no
possibility of this.  There is no possibility at all.  </p>

<p>Someone was saying to me, &ldquo;You know, you are doing a risky
thing in setting a date,&rdquo; and I just thought about this and said back to them, &ldquo;No;
there is no risk in doing this.  If this information was coming from me or if
this was coming from you or anyone else, then this would be a big risk.  More
than likely, we would have the wrong date, and this has been the case
throughout history; but since God knows the end from the beginning and since He
puts this information in the Bible and is now opening up the Bible to reveal
this to His people, where is the risk?  Is it risky to think that Christ is the
Saviour?  Is it risky to think that God is one but three?  Is it risky to know
that we are saved by the faith of Christ?  You see, there is no risk when the
Bible clearly teaches something.  There is no risk at all.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>So many people have these kinds of questions for the child
of God, &ldquo;What are you going to do when May 22<sup>nd</sup> comes?&rdquo;  But what
are they going to do when May 21<sup>st</sup> comes as God has declared?  What
are they going to do on that day?  Is this not the real question?  Is this not
the most important thing?  When the ground under their feet starts to shake and
when it starts to open up all across the world as the earthquake comes to each
land and God begins to raise the dead and the living are raptured while they
are left behind, what are they going to do?  </p>

<p>I will tell you one thing that they are going to do.  They
are going to regret that they spent so many days leading up to that day wondering
about the 22<sup>nd</sup>.  They are really going to regret that they knew that
the 22<sup>nd</sup> of May would come, because it did come for them.  It did,
because they will still be here; but God&rsquo;s people will not be here.  They will
be in Heaven for those five months.  Then they will be eternally with God
forevermore, while the unsaved will be left here.  They will be here and they will
be in big trouble.  </p>

<p>It will be at that point that the individual who has been
laughing at us all along and saying that they are really going to be laughing
at us on the 22<sup>nd</sup> will realize that they had wasted all of this
time.  They wasted their opportunity.  They just wasted the possibility of
salvation.  They neglected &ldquo;so great salvation.&rdquo;  They will then be left here
on this earth and that will be it for them.  That will be it.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #2 is from </i></b><b><i>Franklin</i></b><b><i>,
 </i></b><b><i>NC</i></b><b><i> from someone who visited the website:</i>  </b>I
have some verses for you, such as Matthew 24:36, Revelation 22:18-19, and there
are more.  If you honor the Bible, why have you blatantly cast these verses
aside?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We know that Matthew
24:36 says &ldquo;of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>.&rdquo;  Revelation 22:18-19
has to do with adding or subtracting from the Word of God and being subject to &ldquo;the
plagues that are written in this book.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What is the answer to this person&rsquo;s question?  Are we
ignoring even one verse?  No.  Are many people ignoring the rest of the Bible
and just landing on one or two or three verses?  Yes, definitely; most
definitely they are.  They are ignoring everything that God has said
elsewhere.  They are ignoring the Biblical pattern of history that we see with
Noah and with Lot and with Jonah.  They are ignoring that all throughout the
Bible God forewarned before He did something.  He actually says in Amos 3:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely the Lord JEHOVAH will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants the prophets.  </p>

<p>I heard this analogy that I think originated with Mr.
Camping.  Someone else told this to me and I really think that this is a good
analogy.  The Bible is like a crime scene that really needs to be investigated,
but people go to the Bible and just flip through it.  They are being led to do
things this way by their pastor.  The pastor tells them to look at Matthew
24:36, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man, </i>no, not the
angels of heaven, <span class="underline">but my Father only</span>.  </p>

<p>They close the Bible.  Their pastor told them to read this
one verse and they did this.  They read it.  From there, they conclude that
this one verse proves that we cannot know the day or hour, that we cannot know
that Judgment Day will be May 21<sup>st</sup>; but the Bible is a rather thick
Book.  How many verses did they look at?  </p>

<p>The analogy we have is one of a crime scene.  Since murder
is so common in our day, let us say that there has been a murder.  The
detective comes to the scene.  It is a messy crime scene.  There is evidence
everywhere, but he walks over and picks up just one piece of evidence and then claims
that he has solved the case.  </p>

<p>Maybe this works with Columbo on television, but this is not
the way that this works in real life.  Since he did not look at everything
else, he is more than likely going to arrest an innocent man.  This is because
he has done lousy detective work.  He needed to look at the whole scene.  He
needed to look at the body, how the intruder came into the house, and all of
the stuff that was overthrown in the room.  All of these things need to be
checked out thoroughly or they will not come to a correct verdict or conclusion
when they do finally arrest someone.  </p>

<p>Many people examine the Bible in this way in our day; and,
actually, is the church not the ones who are teaching this kind of
methodology?  They simply go to the Bible and pick and choose a couple of
verses; but when someone picks and chooses just a couple of verses, they can
make the Bible say whatever they want.  </p>

<p>In 1 Timothy 4:10, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that
believe.  </p>

<p>Okay.  Now we have gone to the Bible and we can prove that
Christ is the Saviour of all men.  This is the conclusion that we can come to
when we go to this verse and then find a couple of supporting verses.  He
evidently saves everybody.  Right?  </p>

<p>This is what some churches teach, because this is exactly
what they do.  They all follow the same method of Bible study in regard to
salvation that they are following with the whole idea of no man knows the
timing of the end.  </p>

<p>The problem is that in coming to this conclusion, we would
be absolutely wrong.  Christ did not die for everyone.  He is not the Saviour
of every human being.  He is the Saviour of His elect.  </p>

<p>To understand this, we need to go elsewhere in the Bible. 
We need to turn to other verses and look at all of the evidence.  It is then we
can say that we know that this is what God is saying.  He is the Saviour of &ldquo;all&rdquo;
men when &ldquo;all&rdquo; represents His elect people, but He is not the Saviour of every
human being.  This is an error and this is a false gospel that the churches
declare, because they do not know how to come to truth.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Isaiah 28.  We looked at this a little bit
last week.  In Isaiah 28:9, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine? <i>them that are </i>weaned from the milk, <i>and </i>drawn
from the breasts.  </p>

<p>At this time, God is taking us off &ldquo;milk&rdquo; and giving us the &ldquo;strong
meat&rdquo; of all of the truths that were sealed up and hidden; and so this really
does have a lot to do with our day.  </p>

<p>God is basically saying that this is how He teaches and that
this is how we can understand doctrine, which is the teaching of the Bible. 
Then He gives us a methodology in the next verse, Isaiah 28:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">For precept <i>must be </i>upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and </i>there a little:  </p>

<p>What is another way of saying this?  What is a quicker way
of saying this same thing?  We are to compare Scripture with Scripture or as
the Bible puts it: &ldquo;comparing spiritual things with spiritual.&rdquo;  1 Corinthians
2 says that if we do this, &ldquo;the Holy Ghost teacheth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we do not do this, who is teaching?  It is not the Holy
Ghost.  It is not God who is teaching then.  </p>

<p>So here God is saying that this is the way that He will
teach us knowledge, that this is the way that we will understand doctrine.  It
is when we follow His prescription.  It is when we follow His method: &ldquo;here a
little, <i>and </i>there a little.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to say in Isaiah 28:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
this people. To whom he said, This <i>is </i>the rest <i>wherewith </i>ye may
cause the weary to rest; and this <i>is </i>the refreshing: yet they would not
hear. But the word of JEHOVAH was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon
precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and </i>there a
little&hellip;  </p>

<p>This must be very important because God said this twice.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and
snared, and taken.  </p>

<p>In other words, God wrote the Bible this way and it has to
be understood as we compare Scripture with Scripture.  If we do not follow this
way, guess what?  We are going to &ldquo;fall backward,&rdquo; &ldquo;be broken,&rdquo; &ldquo;snared,&rdquo; and &ldquo;taken,&rdquo;
because we are not coming to the Bible in the way that God says that we have to
come to the Bible.  </p>

<p>In relation to being snared and taken, there is a passage in
Isaiah 8 that relates to this.  We read in Isaiah 8:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a
snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and
fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.  </p>

<p>Then it says in the next verse, Isaiah 8:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.  </p>

<p>This sounds like what we read elsewhere: &ldquo;seal the book [<i>the
Word</i>], <i>even </i>to the time of the end.&rdquo;  This is because it is God&rsquo;s
plan to lay a snare at this time.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that Isaiah 28:7 speaks of drunkenness, which
relates to spiritually drinking other kinds of gospels and then being so
deceived by them that it is like you are in a stupor, like you are so drunk
that you stagger down the steps and do not even feel a thorn if it goes into
your hand.  You think that all is well between you and God because you drank
the &ldquo;strong drink&rdquo; of another gospel.  Spiritually, you are drunk.  Then go to
Luke 21, which is a parallel chapter to Matthew 24, where God says in Luke
21:34-35:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them
that dwell on the face of the whole earth.  </p>

<p>What is the snare?  Their snare is Isaiah 28:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">For precept <i>must be </i>upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and </i>there a little:    </p>

<p>Because the churches do not have the right way of studying
the Bible since they do not know how to do this, they come up with a
fancy-sounding hermeneutic.  They say that we have to take the plain and
literal meaning of the Bible and then try to determine what it meant to the
people of that day.  Then they claim that things are taken out of context when
we compare Scripture with Scripture.  They say all of these kinds of things,
but this limits them.  They say, &ldquo;You cannot jump all around!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Have you ever had somebody say this to you when you are
sharing information from the Bible?  They say, &ldquo;Hold it!  Hold it!  What are
you doing jumping over there?  I want to stick with this verse here in this
passage.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, if they are limiting themselves in this way, what
chance do they have for coming to truth?  They do not have a very big chance. 
We have to go &ldquo;here a little, <i>and </i>there a little.&rdquo;  This is the only
way.  </p>

<p>Since the churches do not have this methodology and actually
mock this way of studying the Bible, of course they are going to be blinded and
of course they are not going to understand the end of the church age.  They do
not understand these things because they cannot use the Bible in a right way.  </p>

<p>We actually read in Romans 11:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:  </p>

<p>This is exactly what God is saying.  What is their &ldquo;table&rdquo;? 
We read in Psalm 23, &ldquo;Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
enemies.&rdquo;  In the Old Testament, the showbread would be set upon a table.  This
is also where we eat.  We eat on a table.  </p>

<p>In Isaiah 28, after speaking of drunkenness, it says in
Isaiah 28:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">For all tables are full of vomit <i>and </i>filthiness, <i>so
that there is </i>no place <i>clean.</i>  </p>

<p>This is picturing their gospel.  The true Gospel should be
laid out as a wonderful banquet, the Word of God, the Bread of Life, the water
of the Gospel, and yet the tables are unclean because of drunkenness.  What
physically follows after one becomes extremely drunk?  They vomit.  It all
comes up.  </p>

<p>So God is indicating that their table is made a snare.  This
is a trap that God has set for all of the inhabitants of the earth.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #3 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>I just
wanted to mention that in Luke 21:34, the word for &ldquo;unawares&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;sudden&rdquo;
as in &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo; that is spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 5.   It says
again in Luke 21:34:    </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you <span class="underline">unawares</span>.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>If we go to 1
Thessalonians 5:2-3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then <span class="underline">sudden</span>
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
shall not escape.  </p>

<p>So it comes &ldquo;unawares.&rdquo;  It is &ldquo;sudden destruction.&rdquo;  No
matter how this is going to hit them on that day - wherever they are going to be,
whatever they will be doing - this is going to be a shock and a surprise.  </p>

<p>Does this mean that people will not be forewarned?  No; it
does not mean this.  This is the same situation that we find with Noah and the
flood in Matthew 24.  It says there that they &ldquo;knew not until the flood came,&rdquo;
but this does not mean that the people of Noah&rsquo;s day did not hear.  They did
hear.  The Bible says that Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of righteousness.&rdquo;  In Noah&rsquo;s
day, it was a world of just a handful of million, which would have been like
the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding area.  </p>

<p>So here was this man who had been working for years on an
ark.  This would be like how the people of Philadelphia all know that there is
a clothespin sculpture outside of City Hall.  Do we not all know this?  This is
just an unusual bit of art, but most of the inhabitants of the city are aware
of this sculpture.  Why are we aware of this?  We are aware of this because we grew
up in this area and word got around, so we went to look at it.  </p>

<p>Are we to think that knowledge of a man building a ship the
size of a cruise liner in his yard was not going to get around?  Of course this
got around.  The people of Noah&rsquo;s day knew.  Then why does it say that the
flood came and they &ldquo;knew not&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>We read about this in Matthew 24:38-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Noe [<i>Noah</i>] entered into the ark, And [<i>they</i>] knew
not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>They heard, but they did not believe this.  They dismissed
this.  They wrote him off as someone who was crazy, &ldquo;In building this ark, this
is an amazing thing that this man is doing, but he is crazy!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There is also a mindset that people get into that is
referred to in the Bible as &ldquo;the will of the Gentiles&rdquo; or &ldquo;the will of man.&rdquo; 
People follow along because of what is referred to as peer pressure.  This is
when people just follow along with what everybody else is doing and with what
everybody else believes; and so the crowds were mostly likely mocking Noah and
making a joke of this.  I am sure that many felt, &ldquo;I am not going to take a
step out and say that I believe this, because I will also be mocked.  I will be
the joke.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But look at the options that these people had.  They could
have either suffered a little reproach for the sake of Christ or die by
drowning and perish forever.  Who knows how an unsaved person is going to die
when the five months begin.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Proverbs 29 and we will see that God realizes
that people hear His Word and do not listen.  They do not listen.  It says in
Proverbs 29:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.   </p>

<p>There will be &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo; and they will be &ldquo;unawares,&rdquo;
but did they hear?  Yes; they heard.  They heard &ldquo;often.&rdquo;  They had been &ldquo;often
reproved.&rdquo;  The Bible tells us that &ldquo;all scripture <i>is </i>given by
inspiration of God, and <i>is </i>profitable for doctrine, <span class="underline">for reproof</span>,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As they keep hearing the Bible proclaim that Judgment Day is
coming on May 21<sup>st</sup>, as they keep hearing this and hearing this and
hearing this, they are being &ldquo;often reproved.&rdquo;  They hear it or they see it on
a billboard or they walk away from a person trying to hand them a tract or they
leave the fellowship where they hear this proclaimed, and then they just move
on with their lives and continue to live as though they did not hear this.  </p>

<p>There are two ways in which people can respond.  One way is
to respond like all of the world before the flood, except for Noah and his
family, and eat and drink and marry and give in marriage.  It also says of Sodom
that &ldquo;they planted, they builded.&rdquo;  This just means that people were going
about their everyday lives.  </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with eating and drinking.  We have to
eat and drink.  There is nothing wrong with marrying and giving in marriage. 
God instituted this.  He is the One who gave marriage.  The problem is that
these activities are for normal times, and we are in a very unusual time
because we are at the time of the end.  </p>

<p>This fact has never come upon another generation before us;
and so people can respond like the people prior to the flood or the second
option is that they can respond like the Ninevites.  How did the Ninevites
respond?  The Ninevites sat in sackcloth and ashes and fasted.  When people
fast, do they eat and drink?  No; not normally.  </p>

<p>We know that the Ninevites also cried mightily unto God, and
God leaves the information about the Ninevites there.  He does not tell us how
long the Ninevites did this.  All that He tells us is that they did fast.  In
other words, the message of &ldquo;yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown&rdquo;
interrupted their lives.  They did not go on with business as usual.  They
allowed this to interrupt their lives.  </p>

<p>It is like when people hear a hurricane warning.  Has anyone
ever experienced this?  I never have.  I know that they do in Florida.  Has
anyone ever been in a place where there was a hurricane warning and the
weatherman was telling you when it was coming?  They can almost predict the time
that a hurricane can hit now.  </p>

<p>So they give the warning out that a hurricane is coming
within a couple of days.  The individual who hears this also has an option. 
They can ignore this warning and just continue on with their daily routine of
cleaning the house and going into the kitchen to make lunch and doing the
laundry and getting the kids ready for school.  They can treat this day like
any other day.  </p>

<p>But wait a minute!  Did they not hear what the weatherman
said?  A hurricane is coming and it will bear down right on their city.  It is
going to come their way.  It is going to hit their house, so what good does it
do to do the dishes or to do the laundry when all of their dishes are probably
going to be destroyed?  What good is taking care of the clothes when all of the
clothes that are in their house are going to be destroyed?  This hurricane is
going to rip their house to shreds.    </p>

<p>So ignoring this is one option and this is the option that
most people take, &ldquo;I will just ignore this and dismiss this.  I am not going to
respond to this.&rdquo;  The other option is the option made by the Ninevites, and we
know that only God can bring about this type of reaction.  </p>

<p>Someone who takes this option when they hear that a
hurricane is coming does not just sit back and wait for it.  They take action. 
They board up their windows.  They grab their valuables.  They grab their
family and they get in their vehicle and flee for safety.  </p>

<p>This is what should happen physically in the world when
people have enough sense to respond to danger in this way.  Spiritually, we
flee to God.  We go to Him.  We beseech Him for mercy.  We cry out that He would
save us.  </p>

<p>In this nation, at least we are blessed that we are being &ldquo;often
reproved.&rdquo;  Things do not have to continue on the way in which we have been
going.  This does not have to continue.  Now is a good time to take this
warning seriously.  </p>

<p>Jonah warned, &ldquo;Yet forty days.&rdquo;  How long have we been
talking about Jonah and Nineveh?  In three weeks, it will be forty days until
Judgment Day.  We just have around sixty days left.  In ten more days, we will
be in the month of April and we will be able to say, &ldquo;Next month will be
Judgment Day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Maybe you are someone who is thinking, &ldquo;I am a little
nervous about this, so I am going to go to God tomorrow.&rdquo;  How long have you
been thinking this?  How long have you been saying this to yourself?  It is
always tomorrow, but you are running out of tomorrows.  By God&rsquo;s mercy, there
is a tomorrow, but there are very few of them left.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #4 is from Paltalk:</i>  </b>Can you give all
of the verses that you know pertaining to Judgment Day coming in a rolling
fashion from &ldquo;nation to nation&rdquo;?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>We know that Jeremiah 25
speaks of &ldquo;nation to nation.&rdquo;  Joel 2 is another good place to go.  Many of us
have been hearing Mr. Camping&rsquo;s study on the book of Joel.  Notice what it says
in Joel 2:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of JEHOVAH
cometh, for <i>it is </i>nigh at hand; A day of darkness and of gloominess, a
day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains:
a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall
be any more after it, <i>even </i>to the years of many generations. A fire
devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land <i>is </i>as
the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and
nothing shall escape them.  </p>

<p>We can see this progression.  This is actually referring to
the people of God.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 9, it identifies God&rsquo;s people as &ldquo;locusts.&rdquo; 
What do locusts do when they swarm?  They come upon a land.  They devour
everything and leave behind them a desolate wilderness; and then they move on. 
</p>

<p>It would appear that the idea of a rolling earthquake - beginning,
we could say, in New Zealand and then progressing to Japan and the Philippines
and beyond, until it reaches us in America - solves a lot of problems.  This is
because then everyone is on May 21<sup>st</sup> when the earthquake hits.  </p>

<p>Also, if we go to Revelation 9, there was a troubling verse
about &ldquo;any green thing.&rdquo;  We read about locusts also in this passage.  It says
in Revelation 9:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was
commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any
green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of
God in their foreheads.  </p>

<p>This means that the &ldquo;green thing,&rdquo; the &ldquo;grass&rdquo; and the &ldquo;trees,&rdquo;
are representing those who do have &ldquo;the seal of God in their foreheads.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>People have been asking about this verse for quite awhile in
relation to what this meant.  Many thought that this was referring to the
possibility of believers being here during the five months.  However, we know
that this is not possible.  Now we can see that the locusts are coming like a
progression across the earth as judgment comes to each nation.  </p>

<p>Those of us who are in nations where this will happen later
on, as well as the true believers in these nations who will not be affected by
this judgment, might even be able to view what is going on in these other parts
of the world; and so here God is telling the true believers not to worry
because this judgment is not coming to hurt them.  This is not coming to
destroy the child of God.  They will not be harmed.  This judgment is only for
the unsaved.  </p>

<p>When it gets to us here in America on May 21<sup>st</sup>,
this is what will happen.  The earthquake will open the ground and God will
take His people up.  There will be no harm done to them by the locusts, because
these locusts are the believers as they are going up into Heaven.  God is going
to use them to bring awful torment to the people of the world, especially to the
professed Christians of the world.  </p>

<p>There is another verse that I think ties in.  We read in Psalm
46:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<i> Though </i>the waters
thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof. Selah.  </p>

<p>So God&rsquo;s people will not fear as this approaches.  They will
be able to see this coming, but God will give comfort.  He will give
encouragement to His people at that time.  We can even recite this to ourselves. 
We will not fear even though we will be seeing the earth practically ripped
apart and these things coming on the world.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #5 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Does
Lamentations 4:10-15 apply to this?  </p>

<p class="verse">The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. JEHOVAH
hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath
kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. The kings
of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed
that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
For the sins of her prophets, <i>and </i>the iniquities of her priests, that
have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, They have wandered <i>as </i>blind
<i>men </i>in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that
men could not touch their garments. They cried unto them, Depart ye; <i>it is </i>unclean;
depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among
the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <i>there.</i>  </p>

<p>I think we can again see God&rsquo;s judgment on His people, the
professed Christians in the churches and congregations, which ties into our
day.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
