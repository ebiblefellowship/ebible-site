  <li><span class="time">00:00</span> <b>A visitor from Taiwan to the EBF website:</b> Hello Family Radio.  I represent a small group of believers in Taiwan.  We have seen your signs all over Kao Shing and are curious to learn more.  We were wondering if there are any public gatherings scheduled for the days leading up to the rapture.  Can we attend?</li>
  <li><span class="time">01:05</span> <b>From the EBF website:</b> God bless you dear brothers and sisters.  I heard Family Radio on a local radio station in Cali, Columbia last year while I was in prison.  I have been listening since and I thank God for you and the message.  Jesus is definitely coming on May 21, 2011.  I have been released recently and I want to do something to spread the news.  Are there any other believers in this area?  Please let me know.  May God have mercy on us.</li>
  <li><span class="time">01:37</span> <b>A visitor from Sacramento, CA to the EBF website:</b> Oh my!  I am so excited that I was able to show the YouTube video &ldquo;Today is the Day of Salvation.&rdquo;  My 21-year-old son cried.  I hope this is because God is working on him.  He has many questions, but this really opened the door.  Thank you so much YouTube 1SwordSearcher channel.  I could not have orchestrated this.</li>
  <li><span class="time">02:11</span> <b>A visitor from Dubai to the EBF website:</b> How many belong to your group and where are they?  I found you through a Google search.  I would like to know more about your group.  I prefer in my mother tongue, Arabic.</li>
  <li><span class="time">02:30</span> <b>A visitor from Denver, CO to the EBF website:</b> Two days ago, I listened to a video on this topic.  This was the first time that I had heard of this specific date being the day of rapture.  The first Scripture quoted was Ezekiel 33:3.  I noted this down on a piece of notepaper along with several other verses cited.  I finished listening to the video, went to my living room, and stuck the notepaper in my Bible.  A few minutes later, I took it outside to read the Scriptures that I had noted for myself.  When I opened my Bible, my notepaper was already placed on the exact page of the beginning of Ezekiel 33.  When I read Ezekiel 33, it became clear to me that God was sending me a loud message to sound the trumpet.  I have been praying and need some more guidance on what to do from here.  Do you have any suggestions?  Are there any local chapters for this movement in the Denver area?</li>
  <li><span class="time">03:48</span> <b>A visitor from Fayetteville, NC to the EBF website:</b> I want to go to Heaven.  We were taking a vacation to New York a week ago.  On the way, I saw a sign saying, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 &ndash; Judgment Day!&rdquo;  Then while in New York, I saw an Asian man holding a sign that was saying the same thing.  In my life, I was not given very much intelligence.  I feel that I have not made a good life.  I am fifty years old.  My mother died when I was eight.  My father died when I was 18.  I always felt that my brothers and sisters were cheated in life.  I wished I could have lived a better life for God.  I just hope that He will forgive me for all of my sins.  I hope that all mankind can rise up to the Heavens.  I love life.  Even though I am not that worthy, I hope you can help me and everybody else in this world. </li>
  <li><span class="time">04:43</span> <b>A visitor from Pittsburgh, PA to the EBF website:</b> I heard about all of this when I was at McDonald&rsquo;s.  I saw a van that said, &ldquo;End of the world &ndash; 2011!&rdquo;  Of course, I was interested.  It is shocking.  It is so soon.  I am only 20 years old.  I am a Christian Baptist.  I just sin a lot and it is hard to get myself straight.  I pray to God that He can change me, not by my will but through His.  What I worry about is if I am still being changed and if it will be enough change when Judgment Day comes around. </li>
  <li><span class="time">05:19</span> <b>A visitor from Romania to the EBF website:</b> Hi!  I read with interest the main part of your website.  Your calculations seem right.  Indeed, in that final time, the people of the Lord will know; but I do have some questions for you.  It would be great if you could reply to me in email.  Are you sure 100%?  What should I do in the final days?  I never drank.  I have never smoked or took drugs.  I am 23 years old and I feel that I have helped a lot of people in my life and have prayed to God from time to time.  I do believe in God: however, for the past year or two, I have not gone to church and I have never read the full Bible.  What is to be done in the last three weeks we might have? </li>
  <li><span class="time">06:35</span> <b>A visitor from Belton, SC to the EBF website:</b> Help!  I believe you, but I do not know where to go or what to do.  I feel like I am all alone out here.</li>
  <li><span class="time">06:46</span> <b>A visitor from La Paz, Bolivia to the EBF website:</b> May our God give us wisdom and, above all, His Holy Spirit.  I am very interested in this topic.  There are many rumors that something big will happen, but I have questions.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">07:04</span> <b>A visitor from United Kingdom to the EBF website:</b> What to do?  I am curious.  You say that churches became pointless in 1988 as God left them and was replaced by Satan.  I was born in 1989.  I have lived what I believe to be a pretty decent life.  I have committed few acts that I believe to be immoral, I have helped others whenever I could, and I have stood up against what I see as evil.  I am, however, not at all religious.  In your view, when May 21st rolls along, am I going to be alright?   </li>
  <li><span class="time">08:20</span> <b>A visitor from Gambrills, MD to the EBF website:</b> Hello.  Great job!  This made it a lot easier to tell people about this.  I just tell them to Google &ldquo;Judgment Day &ndash; May 21,&rdquo; unless they want to sit down and go over some numbers and dates.  Do you know of any May 21st chat rooms?</li>
  <li><span class="time">09:07</span> Could you look at James 1:5-7?  If someone is doubting as they pray, does this mean that God will not save them? </li>
  <li><span class="time">16:18</span> Could you look at Genesis 3:5?  How did Satan know that Christ had taken on evil?</li>
  <li><span class="time">19:13</span> Could you look at John 20:19 and 26?  Is this related to May 21st?  Also, what is the meaning of &ldquo;receive ye the Holy Ghost&rdquo; in John 20:22?  Is this when they became saved?  What relationship does this have to Thomas who was not with them at the time?  Was Thomas a true believer?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">28:06</span> A true believer fears the Lord.  What is the definition of fearing the Lord? </li>
  <li><span class="time">30:53</span> If the locusts that we read about in Revelation 9 are the true believers, why does it say that they will not hurt the true believers during that time?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">35:15</span> I recently talked to a pastor who said there are no verses in the Bible that say to &ldquo;wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.&rdquo;  I discovered that there are 30 of them, including the famous Isaiah 40:31, &ldquo;But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&rdquo;  </li>
  <li><span class="time">35:52</span> In Matthew 26:55, the multitude comes out against Jesus with swords and staves as against a thief.  In Revelation 16:15 Jesus says, &ldquo;Behold, I come as a thief.&rdquo;  I thought that it was interesting what happened in Matthew 26 and that then, on that day, Jesus will come with a sword as a thief to the unsaved.  </li>
