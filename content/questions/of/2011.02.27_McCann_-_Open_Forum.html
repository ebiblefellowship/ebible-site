<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>I am going to begin by reading a
couple of statements that people have made after reading the &ldquo;May 21, 2011 Judgment Day!&rdquo; tract.  We get a lot of responses from this tract, which is
good.  Whether it is positive or negative, I tend to think that a response is
good; at least they are responding.  This is kind of like what happens when we
go out with the Gospel.  Sometimes when people come up, it is a good
conversation.  Other times, they maybe just want to say something negative. 
Either way, it is impacting them and they are responding.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #1 is from </i></b><b><i>Philadelphia</i></b><b><i>,
 </i></b><b><i>PA</i></b><b><i> from someone who visited the website and made a
statement in response to reading the &ldquo;</i></b><b><i>May 21, 2011</i></b><b><i> Judgment Day!&rdquo; tract:</i> </b>I was wondering if you could sign over your
property holdings to me beginning on November 1, 2011.  I am sure that you will
not be needing the properties anymore.  Since I certainly will not be joining
you in the Rapture, I would not want your buildings to deteriorate, so I
promise to thank care of them.  Thanks.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>I do not think that this person
understands completely what is coming.  They have a wrong idea of what is going
to happen on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  This is possible with some people because
the churches teach that the Rapture comes and the world continues on, minus
those people, for a period of time; but this is not how things are going to
be.  </p>

<p>When God comes for His people, it will be the Rapture.  It will
be the resurrection and it will be Judgment Day.  It will be the day when God will
be judging the sins of man.  To begin this process, He will bring about a
worldwide earthquake.  This will certainly bring destruction to all property.  </p>

<p>It is just of no use to get into these kinds of discussions
with people.  There was one person who wrote a while back and said, &ldquo;If you
sell your house and liquidate all of your possessions - your funds, your
stocks, your bonds, your retirement account &ndash; if you do this and if you then
use this money in order to better man in the time that is left, then I will
believe that you believe that May 21<sup>st</sup> will be Judgment Day.&rdquo;  He
was not thinking in terms of using the money to get the Gospel out, because the
world does not have this kind of a mindset.  </p>

<p>Okay; so I have to go through all of this.  I have to sell
everything that I have in order for someone to believe that I believe it.  What
good is it for someone to believe that I believe this?  Is this going to help
them?  No; I think this would be a huge waste of time.  I do not care whether
or not others believe that I believe this.  This is not the issue.  </p>

<p>Of course, what others tend to do is to make this a bit more
significant by saying, &ldquo;If you sign over your home, then I will believe this. 
I will then think that you are really serious about this, and then I will take
this seriously and believe that this is going to happen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What is the problem with this?  If all of us did this, if
all of us sold everything that we possess and we used it for the Gospel and
someone was so impressed by this that they said that they believed, would this
have helped them in any way spiritually?  Would they have believed unto
salvation?  Would this have made them finally accept the truth of the Word of
God?  </p>

<p>No.  This is based on the wrong understanding and doctrine
that the churches teach, which is that man can believe unto salvation on their
own.  They could see this and much, much more but they will never believe unto
salvation.  The Israelites saw the mighty hand of God destroy Egypt and they
did not believe unto salvation.  They crossed the Red Sea with waters as a wall
on either side and they did not believe unto salvation.  They drank water from
a rock and ate bread that fell from Heaven, but none of these things convinced
them.  None of these things convinced the unbelievers in the past and nothing
that a true believer could do today could convince the people of our day.  </p>

<p>It is actually a big fault of others and a big problem for
them when they start watching Mr. Camping, which many do.  They are watching
him because they do not understand that this information is from the Bible, that
it is the Bible that we have to go to, finally, if God will give them mercy to
believe.  They are watching him or they are watching others to see if they are
serious and really believe this, but this is never going to help them.  A lot
of them are even watching just to try to find fault or error within someone so
that they can finally say, &ldquo;Aha!  That person did this or that person said
that; therefore, it is all a hoax.  It is all make believe.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Yes; they can find fault in man.  They can find sin in any
individual if they look hard and close enough, but this is not where anyone
should be looking.  We have to look to the Bible and to what the Bible says.  </p>

<p>The next question is from London.  By the way, Family Radio
had a campaign in London.  I am not sure how many posters they had put up in
their subway systems, but I think it was into the dozens.  Billboards went up
in Ireland and I think that posters went up in Scotland, London, and Wales.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #2 is from </i></b><b><i>London</i></b><b><i>,
 </i></b><b><i>England</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>Hello.  I have a question about
how you believe Judgment Day will be on 21 May 2011.  From Mark 13, no one
knows the time or hour.  Please explain and I will be in touch with you on 22 May 2011 to confirm to you that He will come as a thief in the night.  No one knows, so
watch and pray and do not mislead God&rsquo;s people and those who do not know Him. 
Let Him not catch you sleeping.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>Yes; the Bible has a
couple of statements that say &ldquo;of that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth no man.&rdquo; 
In one statement in Mark 13, it also says &ldquo;neither the Son.&rdquo;  Because of this
verse, many people are convinced that Jesus does not know the time of the end. 
</p>

<p>This is about as false as anything can be, because Jesus is
eternal God.  He is the Almighty.  He is The Everlasting Father, and the Father
knows, right?  The Bible says, &ldquo;But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man, </i>no,
not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.&rdquo;  Well, Jesus said, &ldquo;I and <i>my </i>Father
are one.&rdquo;  He is the Father.  I do not know how this is possible, but He is. 
Therefore, He knows, and there are many other ways that we can prove that He
knows.  Some of His names are: &ldquo;Omega,&rdquo; &ldquo;the end,&rdquo; &ldquo;the last.&rdquo;  These are names
of Christ.  </p>

<p>So He takes upon Himself these names, and then are we to
believe that He does not know when the end will be?  Are we to believe that He
does not know when the last day will be, when one of His names is &ldquo;the last&rdquo;? 
He knows as much about when the end will be as He knows about when the
beginning was.  He was the Creator, and so He is the &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; and He is &ldquo;the
first&rdquo; and He is &ldquo;the beginning.&rdquo;  If He is this, then, of course, He is the
opposite.  </p>

<p>In so many ways, it is dishonoring and displeasing to God
that people who profess to be Christians would think that the Lord Jesus
Christ, God Almighty in the flesh, did not know.  Does He know when He is going
to save the last of His elect?  Does He know this?  You see, if He does not
know one thing, then this will impact a whole bunch of other things.  If He is
in the dark about this very day, well, this day comes after the last of the
elect are saved; then the harvest is gathered immediately, &ldquo;When the fruit is
brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle.&rdquo;  Are we to believe that
He does not know this either?  </p>

<p>How does Jesus answer the disciples&rsquo; question in Matthew 24,
&ldquo;What <i>shall be </i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world&rdquo;? 
Should He not have said, &ldquo;I do not know; I have no idea, because I am in the
flesh&rdquo;?  The Bible says that He &ldquo;knoweth the thoughts of man.&rdquo;  He knew that He
would set down at the table with the Pharisees and He knew their thoughts,
which is not something that men in the flesh can know.  He performed mighty
miracles in the flesh.  He turned water into wine while in the flesh.  He did
all of these acts of eternal God in the flesh, and yet people say that, because
He was in the flesh, He did not know the day or hour.  </p>

<p>No; this cannot be used, and Jesus in Matthew 24 did not
say, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;  When the disciples asked the question, &ldquo;What <i>shall be
</i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&rdquo; He goes on to give
signs: the falling away, the abomination of desolation in the holy place, Israel
being the fig tree in leaf, and so on.  He answers the question because He has
full knowledge.  </p>

<p>I say this just to indicate that if anyone thinks that
Christ does not know, especially those in the churches, and they are flat-out
wrong about this, then what about the idea that the churches have that no man
can ever possibly know?  This should, at least, cause someone to dig a little
deeper and to not be so superficial in the approach to the Bible and just skim
the surface of the Scriptures to come to their own conclusions.  They read, &ldquo;of
that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth no man,&rdquo; and their attitude is, &ldquo;Okay; I
have my answer.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We cannot do this with any doctrine of the Bible.  If we do
this, we are guaranteed to get into trouble and end up going the wrong way with
any teaching.  For example, we read that God is &ldquo;not willing that any should
perish.&rdquo;  We can then close the Bible and assume that we understand this,
right?  We can now say that God wants every individual in the world to be
saved.  </p>

<p>If this is anyone&rsquo;s conclusion, then they have just stumbled
upon a wrong gospel and a wrong doctrine.  If anyone takes a superficial
reading of the Scriptures and they run with it, then they are going to be
wrong; and they can do this with many, many things.  </p>

<p>So this person has great confidence that the 22<sup>nd</sup>
of May will come, as he says, &ldquo;I will be in touch with you on 22 May 2011 to confirm to you that He will come as a thief in the night.&rdquo;  This is
tremendous confidence and faith in a date far off, as he is looking past May 21<sup>st</sup>
to the 22<sup>nd</sup> of May.  </p>

<p>People have written to us and guaranteed this.  They are
guaranteeing this.  We thank God that He is guaranteeing 21 May 2011.  He is matching the prophecy of man.  He is matching the prophecy of the world, of man&rsquo;s
great belief and confidence and faith that this world will continue
indefinitely; basically, it will continue eternally.  </p>

<p>This is why there is so much opposition to the fact that May
21<sup>st</sup> is going to be Judgment Day, because people do not believe that
this world will ever end.  They think that it will just go on and on and on.  </p>

<p>So, of course, May 22<sup>nd</sup> will come, but this is a
prophecy.  This is a prophecy just like God is prophesying a date.  This is why
His people are carrying the message that May 21<sup>st</sup> will be Judgment
Day.  </p>

<p>I do not know if you have noticed something.  There is a phrase
that is not only on the caravans, but it is also going up on the billboards
now, &ldquo;The Bible guarantees it!&rdquo;  This is very important to this message.  God
is guaranteeing this.  It has His seal.  </p>

<p>This is like when you buy something and it has that golden
seal on it that guarantees a certain date for the product, like a ninety-day or
a one-year guarantee.  God is now saying that He guarantees this.  This
guarantee comes through His Word, the Bible, and now it is just a matter of
seeing who is right.  </p>

<p>I hope that no one is planning on sitting back and waiting
to find this out.  I hope that no one is thinking this, &ldquo;I will wait until May
21<sup>st</sup>.  Once the ground starts shaking, then I will start crying to
God.&rdquo;  I realize that many people are going to do this.  Great multitudes of
people in the world are going to do this.  It is then that they will believe. 
They will believe when the earth that they trust in, that solid piece of ground
under their feet, when this starts to move like the waves of the sea, they will
stop trusting in that and start trusting in what God has said; but then it will
be too late.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #3 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Matthew
24:51 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall cut him asunder, and appoint <i>him </i>his portion
with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  </p>

<p>This sounds like judgment and a person being under the wrath
of God, right?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i>  </b>Let us back up to verse 50.  We read
in Matthew 24:50-51:    </p>

<p class="verse">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not
for <i>him, </i>and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall cut him
asunder, and appoint <i>him </i>his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.  </p>

<p>I used to think that this was referring to a place called &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; 
This is what many used to think.  I thought this as well; but once we
understood the timeline and God put that last piece of the five months in, then
we saw that from May 21<sup>st</sup> to October 21<sup>st</sup> would be five
months of torment.  Almost immediately after this, there was an understanding
that developed about judgment; that is, the judgment process and how God will
work this out.  </p>

<p>In Luke 13, we find a reference to the door being shut.  It
says in Luke 13:24-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. When once the master of the house
is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to
knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and
say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:  </p>

<p>We thought that this was referring to Judgment Day.  We
thought that God would be on His throne, that He would have destroyed the
world, that all of the unsaved masses of people would be standing before Him. 
He would judge them and then throw them into a place called &ldquo;hell&rdquo;
forevermore.  This is what we thought.  We thought that it was at that point
that unsaved man would be crying out, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo;  But when we realized that
the door shuts on May 21<sup>st</sup>, this locked in the time period that this
is talking about.  </p>

<p>This is talking about May 21<sup>st</sup>.  On May 21<sup>st</sup>,
the door shuts.  At that point, many will begin to say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo; because
they have seen the Rapture, they have seen God take His people into Heaven, and
they realize that they are left behind.  Therefore, they are pleading with God
and telling Him the good works that they have done in their Christian life. 
They are basically telling God that they should not be left here and that they
should have gone to Heaven.  </p>

<p>In this context, it says in Luke 13:27-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the
prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you <i>yourselves </i>thrust out.  </p>

<p>This is when the weeping and gnashing begins on May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
This is going on on the earth, because we have learned that there will still be
five months of time; and so the people are here crying, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo;  It is
here on this earth that they will be weeping.  </p>

<p>We can just imagine the sorrow that will be going on.  The
word &ldquo;torment&rdquo; that is associated with this is a word that actually points to
intense sorrow that people have because they missed the greatest opportunity
ever and did not go into the Kingdom of Heaven; they are left here.  </p>

<p>There is also anger, and this is what the gnashing of teeth
has to do with.  In Acts 7, it also speaks of this.  This is after Stephen was
witnessing to a Jewish council and was basically being charged with heresy. 
Let us look at why it uses this phrase, because this is important.  God is
moving Stephen to say these words that are very direct.  We read in Acts
7:51-54:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <i>did, </i>so <i>do </i>ye. Which of
the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which
showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the
betrayers and murderers: Who have received the law by the disposition of
angels, and have not kept <i>it.</i> When they heard these things&hellip;   </p>

<p>God convicts and admonishes the church from His Word, and He
is speaking to the church today.  He is very directly finding the errors and
the falsehoods of the church and their hypocrisy.  This is what God&rsquo;s Word
does.  It does this.  God&rsquo;s Word judges, not us.  His Word points the finger at
the churches and congregations and at their failure to be obedient to His Word,
and this brings about anger.  </p>

<p>So in Acts 7:54, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
they gnashed on him with <i>their </i>teeth.  </p>

<p>Then finally, we read in Acts 7:57:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
and ran upon him with one accord,  </p>

<p>They did not want to hear it anymore.  They did not want to
hear the truth of the Word of God.  They &ldquo;stopped their ears.&rdquo;  They put their
hands over their ears so that they would not hear; then they just blindly and
madly ran towards Stephen and killed him.  </p>

<p>The gnashing of teeth is a fury.  It is a great anger that
people will have.  They may start out trying to plead with God, like Esau who
cried, &ldquo;Hast thou but one blessing, my father?&rdquo;  This is what will happen after
the blessing has been given to all of the &ldquo;Jacobs,&rdquo; to God&rsquo;s elect, and they have
been raptured out of here.  It will be as Esau cried, &ldquo;Hast thou but one
blessing?  Bless me, <i>even </i>me also.&rdquo;  But there will be no more
blessings, not even the temporal blessings, because the world at that point
will be one gigantic graveyard.  They realize that there is no blessing, and
this soon turns into anger.  It will turn into mankind being furious with God
that He would dare do this to them.  </p>

<p>This also plays in with them crying, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo;  In
essence, they will be saying to God, &ldquo;Look at what I did for You!  Look at the
time I spent and the money I gave.  I got the Gospel out!&rdquo;  This is what will lead
to the gnashing of teeth, and this is what happens beginning on May 21<sup>st</sup>
and throughout the five months to the people who are left behind.  On October
21<sup>st</sup>, that will be it.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #4 is from the fellowship:</i>  </b>Mr.
Camping was talking about when the men who were trying to tear down Lot&rsquo;s door
to get to the men inside, Lot offered to them his daughters.  The men are then
blinded.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>I heard a good
commentary on this from a caller to Family Radio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open Forum&rdquo; program.  Mr.
Camping also thought about it and agreed with it.  </p>

<p>We draw back at the idea that Lot was willing to give up his
daughters, but we need to understand that these men were God.  This is related
to the idea that God goes first in our lives.  He comes before marriage.  He
comes before children.  He comes before all family.  We put Him first, and so I
think that this is one point that we can take from this.  </p>

<p>Let us read this in Genesis 19:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they said, Stand back. And they said <i>again, </i>This one <i>fellow
</i>came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse
with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, <i>even </i>Lot,
and came near to break the door. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot
into the house to them, and shut to the door. And they smote the men that <i>were
</i>at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they
wearied themselves to find the door.  </p>

<p>Jesus is the door.  Christ says in John 10, &ldquo;I am the door.&rdquo; 
The spiritual meaning of this is that He is the door.  There is great blindness
today in the churches and congregations.  There is &ldquo;strong delusion&rdquo; that God has
sent them.  Just as He struck these men with blindness, He has struck the
churches of our day with spiritual blindness.  Their watchmen are blind; this is
for sure because they do not see anything coming.  </p>

<p>It this was not so tragic, it could almost be funny.  They
send the watchmen up into the tower.  Following Christ&rsquo;s instructions, they
say, &ldquo;Watch therefore.&rdquo;  They are told to be in the tower watching; and so the
watchman goes into the watchtower and they give him his trumpet, and yet they
also give the following instructions, &ldquo;Go ahead up into the watchtower, but
remember that you can never see anything.  You can never find the enemy
approaching.  Keep this in mind, but go ahead and keep watch.  The second thing
is here is your trumpet; but whatever you do, never blow it.  If you do blow
it, make sure that it makes an uncertain sound.  Make sure that the sound is
something that people cannot identify and that no one would respond to.&rdquo;  But
God says in 1 Corinthians 14:8:   </p>

<p class="verse">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle?  </p>

<p>This is referring to the battle of Armageddon; of course God
is going to blow the trumpet very clearly and definitely so that people can
prepare for the battle.  This is why God tells His people this information in
advance from the Bible so that we can then share this with everyone else.  This
is blowing the trumpet.  </p>

<p>The churches say that Christ could come today.  He could
come tomorrow.  He could come next year.  He could come in one hundred years.  </p>

<p>Is there is anything more uncertain than this?  What kind of
trumpet blast is this?  What type of warning call is this?  </p>

<p>Some people really believe this, but I do not think that
they know what they are talking about.  They say, &ldquo;I live each day as if Christ
could come today.  If He comes tomorrow, I will be ready.  I live this way
every day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, they live this way just like all of us live knowing we
could die today or tomorrow, or within the next two and a half months.  They
say that they live this way, but what is the real truth?  If one of us holds to
the idea that we could die today, we could be hit by a car or something, or if,
instead, we were to go to the doctor and the doctor told us that we only had so
long to live, this would be way different than thinking that I &ldquo;might&rdquo; die
today or tomorrow.  This knowledge of the certainty of the end impacts our
lives in a way that the knowledge of it just happening at &ldquo;any time&rdquo; or &ldquo;any
day&rdquo; could ever do.  </p>

<p>It is the same thing with the church as they say that they
live like Christ is coming today, and so forth.  But we can attest that when we
know that there is a set time, an appointed Day of Judgment, which God, in His
mercy, has given us knowledge of, we then realize that this is it; this then impacts
our lives in a big way.  </p>

<p>Is anyone making plans for summer vacation?  How about how
we live with the money we have?  This impacts everything.  Someone who does not
hear this certain, clear, definitive sound of the trumpet can never know what
it is like to live with this expectation of Christ coming.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question #4 continued:</i>  </b>The reason that I
raised this is because this passage deals with Family Radio&rsquo;s latest booklet, &ldquo;Gay
Pride.&rdquo;  These men wanted to have homosexual relationships with these men in Sodom. 
</p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:</i>  </b>The big clue here is
that this is at a time of judgment, because Jesus likens His coming to the days
before the flood and to the destruction of Sodom, and so God is indicating that
homosexuality will be prevalent at the time of judgment.  Romans 1 teaches
this, too, and this is what we are seeing out in the world.  This is another
sign, another indicator of the end.    </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
