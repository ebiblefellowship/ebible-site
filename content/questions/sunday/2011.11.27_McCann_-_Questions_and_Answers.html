<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>I think that it is in the
book of Leviticus where it clearly states that if a man divorces his wife, he
cannot get remarried for as long as his former wife is living.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>God had a law in the Old Testament
that allowed Him to divorce Israel.  It is in Deuteronomy 24:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness
in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give <i>it </i>in her
hand, and send her out of his house.  </p>

<p>So God had this law on the books in order that He could put
away Israel, but then when Jesus was asked by the Pharisees concerning Moses having
said that you could give a writing of divorcement, then He rescinded the law
and said, &ldquo;But from the beginning it was not so&rdquo; and &ldquo;What therefore God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>From that point, never again was there to be divorce.  Israel
was a corporate entity.  Many of them were not even saved.  God married them
for His own purposes.  But when the Gospel went out all through history, all those
who truly become saved became part of the Bride of Christ.  </p>

<p>This is great assurance to each one of us that we could
never be put away.  If we really became saved and if God granted us a new heart
and a new spirit, no sin, not Vashti&rsquo;s sin of disobedience, not any sin can
ever be a reason for God to put us away.  He has given us great assurance.  </p>

<p>This is why it says in Romans 8:38-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;separate&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;put asunder&rdquo; that is
in Matthew 19 where it says, &ldquo;What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So nothing can ever cause God to look on any one of His
people or His whole people collectively and say like Vashti or like Israel, &ldquo;I
am going to put you away.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #1</i>): 
</b>My question is not that.  I know that God allowed divorce there, but the
king divorced Vashti and then he married Esther.  I thought that even in the
Old Testament you could divorce but even if you divorced you were not allowed
to remarry.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I see what you are saying.  Like
today, if someone divorces, they are actually still married; but that was not
the case.  A man could put away his wife and she would not be his wife any
longer I think under that law.  But we also have to remember that he had a
harem.  Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.  These are types and figures
of God because, spiritually, God marries a multitude of people, a huge host of
people; and yet He views it as one marriage.  That is why He allowed Solomon to
multiply wives in order to paint this picture.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Do you believe that
Mordecai penned the book of Esther?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not know who penned Esther.  We
know that God wrote it.  We do find in Esther 9:32, which is the last entry
into the Old Testament:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
it was written in the book.  </p>

<p>That would be the Bible, but it does not say who wrote it in
the book.  They could have had a scribe of the palace write it and doing the
actual physical writing.  We say that Paul wrote Romans, but he did not write
Romans.  Tertius is the scribe who wrote Romans.  </p>

<p>But it does not matter who took a pen in hand.  Even if
Mordecai dictated it, it was God dictating to him and we always come back to
that.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I asked a few people during
the break about that last thing that you mentioned as far as the 23 days
followed by the five months.  You totally lost me on that.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Okay.  Let us go over this.  Ezra
joined Haggai and Zechariah together.  They were contemporaries.  They lived at
the same time.  They were under the rule of Darius who was the king of the
Medes and the Persians.  </p>

<p>They were building the temple at an earlier time than
Esther.  Esther is coming much later, say around 400 B.C.  They are rebuilding
the temple just a couple of decades after coming out of Jerusalem, but I do not
know if we can accurately say the date that the temple was completed.  Let us
say that it was around 515 B.C.  </p>

<p>So what is taking place in Haggai and Zechariah is over one
hundred years earlier.  But the important thing is that in Haggai very exact dates
are given.  Look at Haggai 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
the first day of the month&hellip;    </p>

<p>So this is 6/1 in Darius&rsquo; second year.  </p>

<p>We will not read all of this, but look at verse 10.  We read
in Haggai 1:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth
is stayed <i>from </i>her fruit. And I called for a drought upon the land&hellip;  </p>

<p>But then a change is going to take place because Haggai is
going to prophesy and this stirs up Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest. 
Then it says in Haggai 1:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the
high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and
did work in the house of JEHOVAH of hosts, their God,  </p>

<p>To work in the house of God, we have looked at this before. 
The house of God is a physical illustration.  It was a physical parable,
because the Bible speaks of a spiritual house.  It says in 1 Peter 2:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is all believers.  We are all living stones.  Whenever
God saves someone, it is like He adds a stone to the house that He is
building.  When the house is complete, then the salvation program is over.  </p>

<p>So God is building a house and here in Haggai they are
rebuilding the temple.  They are building the house of God.  God begins to
communicate with Haggai at a very terrible time when there is a famine.  This
reminds us of the beginning of the great tribulation during those 2300
evening/mornings.  </p>

<p>Actually, the famine continued in the church throughout the
whole 23 years.  But then the Lord stirs up Zerubbabel and Joshua and they
begin to work in all the remnant.  That is done in Haggai 1:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second
year of Darius the king.  </p>

<p>It began on 6/1, where God began communicating to Haggai,
which was not a pleasant time.  On 6/24, the second year of Darius, they are
stirred up.  They are working on the temple, the house of God.  </p>

<p>Now look at the 23-year great tribulation where virtually no
one is saved for 2300 evening/mornings.  The latter rain begins to be poured
out.  Another way of looking at it is that the two witnesses stand on their
feet.  Their spirit was stirred and God&rsquo;s people began to evangelize the
world.  </p>

<p>The ingredients for the great tribulation are found in
Haggai 1 between the space of 23 days.  How do we know that it was 23 days? 
6/24 minus 6/1 and we get 23 days.  At the end of 23 days, what day is that
on?  That would be 6/24.  </p>

<p>By the way, this is just something that is interesting, but
what day was the wall finished in the days of Nehemiah?  It was finished in 52
days, but on what date was it finished?  </p>

<p>In Nehemiah 6:15, it tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day </i>of <i>the
month </i>Elul, in fifty and two days.  </p>

<p>Elul is the sixth month.  It was finished in the 25<sup>th</sup>
day of the sixth month.  </p>

<p>Back in Haggai, we have 24 days.  We have day one where it
is describing an awful period.  Then God stirs up the spirit of His people. 
They begin to work, and then we are left at the end of chapter one on the 24<sup>th</sup>
day of the 6<sup>th</sup> month.  It so happens that in the book of Nehemiah
the wall was completed on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of the 6<sup>th</sup> month. 
</p>

<p>In other words, if we would go to the next day, that would
be the end of 23 days and we would be on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of the 6<sup>th</sup>
month in Haggai.  And what happened after 23 years?  The wall of salvation, we
understood, was finished.  It was completed.  This is just an additional thing
to confuse us at this time.  </p>

<p>But in Haggai 1, we have 6/1 when he begins to prophesy.  On
6/24, 23 days later, turn to Zechariah and look at Zechariah 1:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the four and twentieth day [<i>or the 24<sup>th</sup> day</i>]
of the eleventh month, which <i>is </i>the month Sebat, in the second year of
Darius&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is the same year and the same king, and Ezra joins Haggai
and Zechariah together.  They both prophesied at the same time.  </p>

<p>So 6/24 to 11/24 is how long?  It is five months.  It is
like saying May 21 to October 21.  We can easily see this because it ends on
the same day of the month five months later.  We know that May is our fifth
month and October is our tenth month and it just goes five months.  </p>

<p>Well, the 6<sup>th</sup> month and 24<sup>th</sup> day to
the 11<sup>th</sup> month and 24<sup>th</sup> day of the Hebrew calendar is
five months.  This is the significance.  We have 23 days in Haggai 1 ending on
a date that is picked up in Zechariah, his contemporary, five months later, and
then we read of Hadassah or <i>hadac</i> (had-as), Esther&rsquo;s name or the myrtle
tree.  Then we get that strange vision.  </p>

<p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can you explain more about
October 21 as far as what you think happened spiritually and how it links into
the five months and where we are now?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not know if I am fully ready to
do this, but let us look at a verse.  I think this might help, but I do not
really understand it.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 9, we read of five months.  It says in
Revelation 9:12:    </p>

<p class="verse">One woe is past; <i>and, </i>behold, there come two woes more
hereafter.  </p>

<p>I taught this and Mr. Camping taught this.  We believed that
all three woes were simultaneous.  It could be that the five months is one woe
past.  The word &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; means &ldquo;from now&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;there come two woes more [<i>from now</i>].</p>

<p>The interesting thing is what we read in Revelation 9:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is before God,  </p>

<p>And then it goes on to speak of those four messengers who
were bound in the great river Euphrates and then their loosing.  But after it
mentions one woe is past, we read of four horns, and in Zechariah 1 we read of
four horns after the 24<sup>th</sup> day of the 11<sup>th</sup> month, if you
read through the whole chapter.  Then there are four carpenters and it mentions
four horns.  </p>

<p>So this would seem to indicate that it is pointing to a
period of time after five months that we missed.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank You for all of Your
blessings.  We thank You for food, for spiritual food and for physical food. 
Father, we thank You that both are abundant for us today.  Father, we ask for
Your blessing of this food on our bodies that You may strengthen us physically
and of Your Word on our hearts.  May we be strengthened spiritually by Your
Word and by Your Spirit in our inner man.  We pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s
Name.  Amen.  </i></p>
