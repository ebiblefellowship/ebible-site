  <li><span class="time">30:00</span> I am still a little puzzled about the five months.  You touched all around this today in regards to the scorpions and the fire and brimstone.  Their &ldquo;power is in their mouth.&rdquo;  You just talked about &ldquo;the dragon&rdquo; and how all of the fish were thrown on the land.  Could this be during the five months?  I know that a lot of stuff happened before the five months, but these five months are very, very important.  The scorpions come out and they do not kill anybody; they just torment them.  The torment would not be before May 21st.  There is supposed to be torment going on and it is from the mouth.  Is the Lord going to let them see something that we have said?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">32:37</span> (continued from Question 8) What I found is that nothing in Revelation points out the sorrow.  It points out pain and suffering, and I went over all of the verses.  Nothing in these five months is like the sorrow that we thought of or like Mr. Camping was pointing out.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">33:28</span> (continued from Question 9) As I saw it when I went over it all in Strong&rsquo;s, I was surprised that it coming up with the same exact number.  But how do the many lashes come in, as well as the fewer lashes?  This cannot be before May 21st, and yet this stuff is supposed to be coming out of their mouths.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">36:50</span> Is it possible that young Christians might realize in the middle of this that righteousness has come to their lives?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">37:45</span> Could you explain Daniel 7:11-12? </li>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>You might already know this
question, because I got this from your Facebook wall.  Is the earthquake in
Revelation 16 spiritual or are we still expecting an earthquake in October?      </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Let us look at Revelation 16.  It says
in Revelation 16:17-21:    </p>

<p class="verse">And the seventh angel [<i>messenger</i>] poured out his vial
into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from
the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and
lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were
upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and </i>so great. And the great
city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and
great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the
wine of the fierceness of his wrath. And every island fled away, and the
mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i>every
stone </i>about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the
plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.  </p>

<p>So we see that this earthquake is mentioned as &ldquo;so mighty an
earthquake, <i>and</i> so great,&rdquo; and then it does not sound like things ended
there.  The city is &ldquo;divided into three parts,&rdquo; and we saw what happened to the
third part.  This leaves the other two parts.  The great earthquake has to do
with May 21 in opening the prison spiritually and also in bringing Judgment Day
upon man.  </p>

<p>What is going to happen on October 21 and how is God going
to open the ground?  He may use an earthquake.  As far as what hour in which He
is going to do this, I do not really want to get into this.  We just know that
October 21 is it, but we do not have to know all of the details about that
day.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>In relation to the 200
million, is this number only from the great tribulation until today?  Are we
saying that there are more than 200 million or that there are just these 200
million?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>There are 200 million.  This is the
great multitude that came out of great tribulation.  They were bound in Babylon
in the river Euphrates and they are loosed, and the great day of loosing was
May 21.  Everything points to this day.  As far as the end of the 70 years, the
captives go free out of Babylon.  When Israel left Egypt ties into May 21.  The
second Jubilee period ended when Judgment Day came on May 21, and the Jubilee
is the proclamation to let the captives go free.  We see all of this, and so
the 200 million are identified with May 21.  </p>

<p>Mr. Camping had been thinking that this was the sum total of
all of God&rsquo;s elect all throughout history.  This was because on May 21 we had
thought that those in the ground would come up to join those alive at that time. 
Then all would be raptured.  </p>

<p>As a result of this, those left behind would experience the
plagues and the judgment and everything that we were talking about.  It did not
happen this way, but judgment did begin; and so we have to modify this a little
bit.  </p>

<p>Those who were in the ground did not receive resurrection,
and so the 200 million now more identify with all of those saved during the
6100 days of the &ldquo;latter rain,&rdquo; especially on that last day.  </p>

<p>Some people are having a hard time because they were
thinking that they were saved maybe even before 1988.  So am I saying that they
were bound and that they were one of the locusts who came out of the bottomless
pit, which was a holding place, or that they were bound in the great river Euphrates? 
</p>

<p>Well, this is pointing to those who were loosed from
spiritual bondage, but this is also pointing to the loosing of the judgment;
and God is using His people because the saints would judge the world and would bring
this judgment to the 200 million; and so we are all identified as being loosed
in that sense.  </p>

<p>Also, remember that Paul and Silas went into the prison and
were prisoners themselves.  Their door was opened, just like all of the other
prison doors were opened, and so God could be looking at true believes.  </p>

<p>This is like what we read in Hebrews 13:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them&hellip;   </p>

<p>Paul and Silas were thrown into prison and they had no
choice about this; but when we brought the Gospel, the act of doing that, was
pictured by what God is saying here.  When believers bring the Gospel, we do it
humbly and we acknowledge that we sill have bodies that sin, that we are
sinners.  In this sense, we minister as though we are bound; and so it fits
this way, too, in that we are all loosed at the same time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at
Revelation 15:7-8?  In relation to the &ldquo;seven angels&rdquo; who are pouring out the
vials in Revelation 16, is it possible that we could not yet go to Heaven
because we are the ones pouring out these vials for God if we are these
messengers?  This means that we could not leave yet, because we are the ones
who are to be doing the tormenting.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Revelation 15:7:    </p>

<p class="verse">And one of the four beasts [<i>or living creatures</i>]&hellip; </p>

<p>This is God.  We want to make this distinction because the
devil is called &ldquo;the beast.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Revelation 15:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels [<i>messengers</i>]
seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. And
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and
no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven
angels [<i>messengers</i>] were fulfilled [<i>finished</i>].</p>

<p>God is using us, and this is a good point.  In 1 Corinthians
6, we read that &ldquo;the saints shall judge the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How is God using these 200 million?  For instance, we do not
know who these 200 million are.  We may know acquaintances or brethren whom we
have met over the last few years.  Maybe we know of hundreds or maybe even
thousands, but God speaks of the 200 million like an army that march in
unison.  If we look at Joel 2, it says that &ldquo;they shall not break their ranks&rdquo;;
and so we wonder how God is going to use us as one huge army to judge with Him
as He is judging the world.  </p>

<p>I think the answer is what we read in John 1 in relation to
Nathanael.  Jesus is saying this to him, because Nathanael believed in Christ after
Jesus had done a really simple thing, as He said, &ldquo;When thou wast under the fig
tree, I saw thee.&rdquo;  Then Nathanael said, &ldquo;Thou art the Son of God; thou art the
King of Israel.&rdquo;  Nathanael knew that He was the Messiah as a result of this.
Then Jesus told him, &ldquo;Thou shalt see greater things than these.&rdquo;  Then it says
in John 1:51:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, <span class="underline">Hereafter</span>
ye shall see heaven open, and the angels [<i>messengers</i>] of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of man.  </p>

<p>First of all, this word &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; is found in Matthew
26:64.  Jesus is speaking to the high priest of Israel:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
you, <span class="underline">Hereafter</span> shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  </p>

<p>Did the high priest see this with his eyes?  The high priest
of Israel at that time was Caiaphas and he never physically or literally saw
this, but this is indicating that they were going to know that Christ was the
Messiah.  They were going to know from that point on that, yes, God was in
their presence.  </p>

<p>So when we see this word &ldquo;see,&rdquo; this does not mean that we
physically see.  Jesus is saying here in John 1:51:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels [<i>messengers</i>]
of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.  </p>

<p>Again, this word &ldquo;angels&rdquo; is better translated &ldquo;messengers.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>So Christ is basically saying that He is going to save
people.  Immediately, they will be lifted up and seated &ldquo;in heavenly <i>places </i>in
Christ Jesus.&rdquo;  We have known this because Ephesians tells us this.  </p>

<p>Whenever anyone becomes saved, they are still here on earth;
and so God dispatches them and they descend.  They never really went to Heaven,
but God is looking at them in Christ, who is seated at the right hand of the
Father, who sends them for a purpose back to earth, even though they never
left, to carry the Gospel.  As they heard the Gospel from someone, it is now
their responsibility to carry the same message of the Bible to others.  </p>

<p>What happened on May 21 is that 200 million &ndash; we will just
use this number &ndash; 200 million ascended into the heavenlies to be seated at the
right hand of God; and so they ascended &ldquo;upon the Son of man.&rdquo;  Yet when they
came back to earth, in this figure of speech, they were not sent out with the
Gospel, because Christ has cut this off.  </p>

<p>All throughout history, the saved would ascend and descend
and were commanded to go forth.  But Judgment Day came and no more are being
saved.  What would be the point of sending out messengers of the Gospel?  And so
Jesus stopped it there.  </p>

<p>But can you imagine what a tremendous blessing it would be
if He moved in all of these people &ldquo;to will and to do of <i>his </i>good
pleasure&rdquo; to bring that message to the world?  And yet He stopped it.  </p>

<p>Does any true believer feel that they should now be out
there and that they should be getting the Gospel out?  No; and we almost knew
this right away.  Mr. Camping had the same feeling.  We are not going to be
warning about October 21, Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Family Radio, the most evangelistic tool that I think the
world has ever seen has sent forth how many millions of tracts?  How many
people in this room used to receive boxes of tracts from Family Radio?  Over
the course of many years, anyone in the world could have asked and they would
have received about 5,000 tracts.  They sent tract teams to so many countries. 
They advertised and were broadcasting all over the world that time was short.  </p>

<p>This has all stopped and it is not because we are afraid. 
It is also not because Satan has stopped us.  This is because Christ, who
dispatches those who descend upon Him, is not doing this.  </p>

<p>So all 200 million now are in unison.  Typically, they
should be marching forth; but now Christ has stopped this.  This is because He
is viewing the whole earth as though fire and brimstone is falling, and we do
not sow seed in ground that has had fire and brimstone fall upon it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at
Revelation 16:12-14?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Revelation 16:12:    </p>

<p class="verse">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates;
and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might
be prepared.</p>

<p>The river Euphrates is Babylon&rsquo;s river.  It is the boundary
of the kingdom of Israel or the Kingdom of God, but the river itself identifies
with Babylon; and this river dries up.  </p>

<p>What does this make us think of?  It makes us think of the
crossing of the Red Sea and the crossing of the river Jordan.  </p>

<p>Here, the river of Babylon dries and prepares the way for
the kings of the east.  The gospel water of Babylon is identified with the
churches and congregations, and this is completely dried up.  This is what has
actually happened all over the earth, as Babylon is also the world.  As far as
sending this forth unto salvation, the Gospel water is dried up.  This prepares
the way for God&rsquo;s people to make that final crossing; but this is not literal. 
This is talking about going into the Promised Land of Heaven.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Revelation 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i>come </i>out of
the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
mouth of the false prophet.  </p>

<p>The number 3 is in view, which is God&rsquo;s purpose that this
happen.  </p>

<p>I do not fully understand this verse, but we do find in
Revelation 19 that the Bride &ldquo;hath made herself ready.&rdquo;  This is all of the
elect who are &ldquo;arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know that there is this good tradition that people have
of being married in white, because this is a picture of the body of believers. 
Christ is the Husband and the believers are the Bride; and so the Bride is
ready, but there is still a war.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 19, it speaks of Christ on a white horse. 
Then look at verse 14, Revelation 19:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the armies <i>which were </i>in heaven followed him upon
white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.  </p>

<p>This is referring to an army of horsemen and the 200 million
are also called horsemen.  It is said of the locusts in Revelation 9 that they
are &ldquo;like unto horses.&rdquo;  Joel 2 also speaks of horsemen, as they are destroying
the Garden of Eden behind them and leaving a &ldquo;desolate wilderness.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So here comes Christ with an army of horsemen clothed in
fine linen, which is the righteousness of the saints.  They are all saved and
these are going to the battle.  Then we read in Revelation 19:17-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather
yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; That ye may eat the flesh
of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh
of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all <i>men, both </i>free
and bond, both small and great. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the
earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on
the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the
false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them
that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.  </p>

<p>We have already learned that Satan was taken and that God
looks at him as though he were killed even though he still exists.  We also
know now that the church, the third part, was killed at the same time.  Satan,
the beast, was killed and the church was killed.  </p>

<p>We know that this all happened at that transition.  On May
20<sup>th</sup> or 21<sup>st</sup>, Satan lost all official power and the
churches lost all hope.  </p>

<p>We know Satan&rsquo;s role as &ldquo;the beast.&rdquo;  &ldquo;False prophet&rdquo; is a
name of Satan that identifies particularly with the church, because the false
prophet &ldquo;wrought miracles before him&rdquo;; and so it looks like these two &ldquo;were
cast alive into a lake of fire.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We have to get away from a literal understanding.  The 200
million are bringing fire and brimstone, and we read here of a &ldquo;lake of fire&rdquo;
that is &ldquo;burning with brimstone.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is looking at the official rule of Satan or &ldquo;the
beast&rdquo; as being over.  He is killed and the church is slain.  This means that
they are already in the &ldquo;lake of fire.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This explains Revelation 20:10:   </p>

<p class="verse">And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet <i>are</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is either &ldquo;are&rdquo; or &ldquo;were.&rdquo;  I am not sure which tense
to use here; but either way, this is strange.  Is this not strange that &ldquo;the
beast&rdquo; and &ldquo;the false prophet&rdquo; are already there?  They are either there
presently or they have been there.  Then here God is speaking of &ldquo;the devil&rdquo;
and He is going to cast the &ldquo;small and great&rdquo; into the &ldquo;lake of fire,&rdquo; which is
&ldquo;the second death.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we go back to Revelation 19:20 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;These both were cast alive&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word means &ldquo;alive.&rdquo;  God is &ldquo;the living God&rdquo; and this
is the same word.  Actually, if you look this word up, this is dealing with the
Gospel, with salvation, with life, with existence.  </p>

<p>So they are consciously aware.  They are living because they
are still walking around.  One-third of the world has been killed, but they are
not physically dead.  They are alive when this takes place.  Satan is not
ultimately destroyed or annihilated.  He is still out there; it is just that he
has lost all power.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 19:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the remnant [<i>loipoy:G3062</i>] were slain with the sword
of him that sat upon the horse, which <i>sword </i>proceeded out of his mouth:
and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.  </p>

<p>Again, God is separating out Satan and the church, and the
church identifies with &ldquo;the false prophet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Is it not ironic that it is the church that is pointing the
finger at Mr. Camping and all of God&rsquo;s people and claiming that he is a false
prophet, when God actually identifies them completely with &ldquo;<span class="underline">the</span> false
prophet&rdquo;?    </p>

<p>They are the ones, because they were not bringing the truth,
who came under the wrath of God and the judgment of God immediately.  Then
there is the remnant, the rest of mankind who will be slain, also.  They are
going to die, but there is that small hope that perhaps they might be saved as
they live through this five-month period.  At the end, this remnant is also
killed and they are also cast into &ldquo;the lake of fire,&rdquo; which is complete
annihilation.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>It is amazing to realize
these things that are happening.  We cannot see this, but there are these
tremendous things happening.  So it looks like there are two-thirds that have
been annihilated or vanquished.  It looks like the one-third is being gathered
to the great day.  I know that this is very difficult spiritual language.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The third part is dead.  The third
part represents those in the churches.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>The beast and the false
prophet, which were cast into the &ldquo;lake of fire,&rdquo; has this happened yet?  Where
is Satan right now?  What is happening with the devil?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>He is out there and he is still roaming
the earth, but we have to remember that he was bound at the cross.  Then in
1988, he was loosed, and he was loosed in a major way, because look at the
world and the church since then.  We can definitely see a comparison between an
evil world when Satan was bound and an evil world when Satan was loosed.  It is
just far more evil, and yet he was loosed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, which he
did, bringing judgment on the churches and the congregations officially.  This
is why God says of Nebuchadrezzar, who was a type of Satan, that he was &ldquo;my
servant.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So, officially, he had this.  He was given power to continue
42 months, the length of the great tribulation.  Now, though, his power has
been stripped.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Ezekiel 32, which talks about Egypt and
Pharaoh.  Just like Nebuchadrezzar, Pharaoh typifies Satan.  But let us first
go back to Ezekiel 29:2-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
prophesy against him, and against all Egypt: Speak, and say, Thus saith the
Lord JEHOVAH; Behold, I <i>am </i>against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the
great <span class="underline">dragon</span> that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My
river <i>is </i>mine own, and I have made <i>it </i>for myself. But I will put
hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy
scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the
fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales. And I will leave thee <i>thrown
</i>into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall
upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have
given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 
</p>

<p>Here is Satan, typified by Pharaoh, as a &ldquo;the great dragon&rdquo;
or a sea monster or a serpent.  God brings him out of the river, and it is his
river because it is not God&rsquo;s Gospel water.  He brings him out onto the land
and all of the fish of the river are clinging to him.  This would be Satan and
those in the churches and the congregations.  Notice that this is similar
language to Revelation 19 because the fowls are feasting.  </p>

<p>Now go to Ezekiel 32.  This is still speaking of Pharaoh. 
We read in Ezekiel 32:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou <i>art </i>as
a <span class="underline">whale</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Whale&rdquo; is the same word for &ldquo;dragon&rdquo; that we read in Ezekiel
29.  Ezekiel 32:2 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou <i>art </i>as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth
with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their
rivers.  </p>

<p>What this is really saying is that the Gospel is &ldquo;trodden
under foot.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezekiel 32:3-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; I will therefore spread out my net
over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my
net. Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open
field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I
will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. And I will lay thy flesh
upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. I will also water
with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, <i>even </i>to the mountains;
and the rivers shall be full of thee. And when I shall put thee out, I will
cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a
cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.  </p>

<p>This ties in with May 21; because immediately after the
tribulation of those days, the sun is darkened, the moon does not give its
light, and the stars fall.  </p>

<p>So here God is telling us what He is going to do to &ldquo;the
dragon.&rdquo;  He is going to take him out of his rivers, and remember that the Euphrates
dries up.  He is going to take him out and put him on the land with the fish;
and the fish are men.  These are all those in the churches and congregations
who worship &ldquo;the beast.&rdquo;  These are clinging to him and they are all exposed to
the fouls for them to come and feed on them.  And so God identifies this with
May 21.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezekiel 32:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not
known. Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be
horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they
shall tremble at <i>every </i>moment, every man for his own life, in the day of
thy fall.  </p>

<p>Again and again, God keeps emphasizing this.  The king of Babylon
fell.  The king of Egypt also has a fall, and Satan, too.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you explain Hosea 1?

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not know if I could explain the
whole chapter.  We know that Hosea was a prophet.  God commanded him to marry
Gomer, who was a harlot.  God does this in order to paint a picture between
Himself and Israel or the church and the spiritual harlotry that they were
involved with.  Then Gomer has children.  Through the names of these children,
like Loruhamah, God is indicating that He will not have mercy.  </p>

<p>Maybe this is why you are interested in this because God is
saying that He will not have mercy, and we know that He does not have mercy in
judgment.  There was no mercy on the churches for anyone being saved within the
churches, and there is no mercy on the world now.  </p>

<p>But I do not know how to relate this to what is going on
today.  Maybe we could look at this later.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I am still a little puzzled
about the five months.  You touched all around this today in regards to the
scorpions and the fire and brimstone.  Their &ldquo;power is in their mouth.&rdquo;  You
just talked about &ldquo;the dragon&rdquo; and how all of the fish were thrown on the
land.  Could this be during the five months?  I know that a lot of stuff
happened before the five months, but these five months are very, very
important.  The scorpions come out and they do not kill anybody; they just
torment them.  The torment would not be before May 21<sup>st</sup>.  There is
supposed to be torment going on and it is from the mouth.  Is the Lord going to
let them see something that we have said?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not think that we have to look
for this.  We have to look at this from God&rsquo;s perspective.  </p>

<p>The judgment on the church helps us, because that was a real
judgment.  Actually, God is reinforcing that it was a far greater and more
awful judgment than we had ever thought by the judgment that He is bringing
now.  We are seeing how awful it is when this expands.  </p>

<p>God brought the judgment on the churches.  Did the churches
know?  They heard, but did they know?  Did they think that as they were
gathering together that they were worshipping Satan?  No; they denied this and
they continued on.  To them, this judgment was not even a judgment.  They did
not acknowledge this or recognize this, and it could be the same today, which
it is.  </p>

<p>Did God give the churches a terrible judgment?  Yes.  There
was no salvation.  Is it an awful judgment now?  Yes.  From God&rsquo;s perspective,
torment means mostly sorrow, a troubling of mind.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question (continued from Question 8):  </b>What
I found is that nothing in Revelation points out the sorrow.  It points out
pain and suffering, and I went over all of the verses.  Nothing in these five
months is like the sorrow that we thought of or like Mr. Camping was pointing
out.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We do not limit this word just to the
book of Revelation.  We see how this word is used wherever.   Where they were &ldquo;toiling
in rowing,&rdquo; it is the same word.  In toiling, they are not being tortured.  It
is just that it was laborious.  They toiled in rowing.  </p>

<p>This word is used in a way that is very surprising in the
New Testament.  When we look at it, we see that this word does not carry the
awful weight that we thought it did.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question (continued from Question 9):  </b>As
I saw it when I went over it all in Strong&rsquo;s, I was surprised that it coming up
with the same exact number.  But how do the many lashes come in, as well as the
fewer lashes?  This cannot be before May 21<sup>st</sup>, and yet this stuff is
supposed to be coming out of their mouths.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Let me try to explain this again
quickly.  God shut the door on the whole world.  As a result of this action
that only God could take, this brings torment to two-thirds of the population
who are unsaved, whether they know this or not.  From God&rsquo;s perspective, this
is what God is doing.  </p>

<p>These two-thirds, though, have the slightest bit of hope
that if they were to hear about this from believers or from Family Radio that
maybe, even though they might have mocked about this, maybe though, God could
still have saved them.  </p>

<p>So they are not killed immediately from this movement into
Judgment Day, but the third part, which typifies the third-part of the world in
the churches, are killed immediately from this transition of judgment on the
church to judgment on the world with no one being saved.  This is more stripes
because they have no hope.  They knew the Master&rsquo;s will, but they did not
hearken.  </p>

<p>Maybe you could just consider this idea.  As a friend said
to me, &ldquo;Going from no hope to the tiniest bit of hope is a huge difference.&rdquo;  Their
punishment is that the door of Heaven is shut.  They could not be saved before
May 21 because they were in the church.  They cannot be saved now anywhere in
the world.  </p>

<p>This is far greater than for an individual, let us say, like
a Buddhist.  Maybe a Buddhist saw a billboard, but he rejected it and did not
pay any attention to it.  He also transitions to this period; but perhaps, for
himself or for others who might know him, they could continue to pray, &ldquo;O Lord,
could You have mercy, having had mercy?  Could it be that You had done a work
in his heart before Judgment Day came?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There is actually a huge difference.  This is why the rest
of the men are not slain and this is why the third part are slain.  This is all
from God&rsquo;s perspective.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Is it possible that young
Christians might realize in the middle of this that righteousness has come to
their lives?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We do not know how God works in every
case.  If we all were to get together and ask how God entered into our lives,
there are going to be a lot of differences.  We do not even know when God saved
us.  We may start getting into our minds that we want to serve God, but He
could have saved us three months earlier.</p>

<p>This is the little bit of hope that anyone outside of the
church could have.  Possibly, potentially, God did a work of salvation.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you explain Daniel
7:11-12?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I will begin reading in verse 9.  We
read in Daniel 7:9-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
days did sit, whose garment <i>was </i>white as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne <i>was like </i>the fiery flame, <i>and </i>his
wheels <i>as </i>burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before
him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. I
beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I
beheld <i>even </i>till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given
to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their
dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.  </p>

<p>I do not know.  I have not looked at this.  This sounds
interesting and it seems to relate.  </p>

<p>We do know that this has to do with Judgment Day.  Verses 9
and 10 fit with Revelation 20 very well when God is opening the books there to
judge mankind.  </p>

<p>But as far as the reference to &ldquo;the beast,&rdquo; &ldquo;the beast was
slain&rdquo; and &ldquo;the rest of the beasts,&rdquo; I do not know.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here and we will close with a word of prayer.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Father, thank You once again for the Bible.  We pray
that You would bless our reading of it.  It is always a blessing to read the
Bible, even if someone is not saved, as Isaac blessed his sons concerning
things to come.  We pray that we would realize that the reading or that the
listening of the Bible is a great blessing.  Father, we pray for our families
and we ask that perhaps You might have done a work in them.  We do pray for
each one of them that they might come forth as Lazarus to life, even though
they have grave clothes bound about them.  Over this period, may those grave
clothes be taken off and may they realize that they have been given the gift of
eternal life.  Father, we thank You once again and we pray these things in
Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </i></p>
