<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Could you explain &ldquo;and
their enemies beheld them&rdquo; in Revelation 11:12?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Revelation 11:12:    </p>

<p class="verse">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld
them.  </p>

<p>This is looking towards the last day, but I do not know
exactly how this is going to work out.  We do know that the day of the rapture
is on the last day.  God is indicating that He will take His people up at the
end of this 153-day period, and I am content with leaving how the last day is
going to work out with God.  </p>

<p>We really got into trying to know every little detail of the
time and everything regarding May 21 and we were incorrect.  If someone knew
absolutely and without question what is going to happen on October 21, I would
like to discuss it; but I am not interested in speculation.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at 1
Corinthians 16:9-12?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in 1 Corinthians 16:9-12:    </p>

<p class="verse">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i>there
are </i>many adversaries. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you
without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <i>do.</i> Let no
man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come
unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. As touching <i>our </i>brother
Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will
was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
convenient time.  </p>

<p>Verse 9 is referring to what we just witnessed during the
latter rain in that a &ldquo;great door and effectual&rdquo; was opened.  Actually, this
has application to any period where God is sending forth the Gospel and saving
people.  It is a door that is opened to Heaven.  But notice what goes
hand-in-hand with this: &ldquo;<i>there are </i>many adversaries.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you are teaching false, then no door to Heaven is open. 
In all probability, not too many people are going to contest what you say. 
There would be some critics.  There are always critics of everything; but for
the most part, people would not be interested.  </p>

<p>There is a whole world of falsehood out there.  If you are
just teaching another false gospel, this fits right in.  Even though some
people might not like it when they see a minister on television selling a
prayer hankie for a couple of hundred dollars, because most people know that
this is ridiculous; but even there, they are not too critical.  No one makes it
a point to campaign against it and to spend most of their waking time
campaigning against it.  </p>

<p>But on the other hand, if you have the truth, if there is
actually a great door &ndash; Christ is the door to Heaven &ndash; and a great multitude
was being saved, like we just witnessed and as God told us, then all of the
stops are pulled out.  Satan realizes that his kingdom is being ransacked, and
so he gathers his forces and they come against the Gospel or the source of the
Gospel to assault and attack.  This is what we saw with the message of Judgment
Day.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>According to Habakkuk 2:3,
I am getting worried that October 21 might not happen. </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I understand what you are saying.  Let
us read this in Habakkuk 2:2-3:    </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it
</i>plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.  </p>

<p>It says in Psalm 119, &ldquo;I will run the way of thy
commandments.&rdquo;  It is the same as walking in His commandments.  It means to
obey them.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the vision&hellip;  </p>

<p>The whole Bible is likened to a vision.  </p>

<p class="verse">For the vision <i>is </i>yet for an appointed time, but at the
end it shall speak&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is actually a mistranslation.  This should say, &ldquo;He
shall speak.&rdquo;  This is a pronoun and it can be he, she, or it, depending on the
context.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 10:37 is a quote from Habakkuk.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.  </p>

<p>Notice that this is the masculine pronoun.  It is &ldquo;he that
shall come.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So it says in Habakkuk 2:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the vision <i>is </i>yet for an appointed time, but at the
end it [<i>he</i>] shall speak, and not lie: though it [<i>he</i>] tarry, wait
for it [<i>him</i>]; because it [<i>he</i>] will surely come, it [<i>he</i>] will
not tarry.  </p>

<p>From our perspective, it is as though God tarried, because
we were looking for Him on May 21; but He is telling us that this was all
according to the plan, to His scheduled timeline.  He is not tarrying at all.  </p>

<p>Look at Exodus 14 at what God has Moses say to the people. 
This is for all of us, as the people were fearful.  It says in Exodus 14:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
see the salvation of JEHOVAH, which he will show to you to day: for the
Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  </p>

<p>This is our admonition.  This is for all of us.  God tells
us to be anxious for nothing and this includes the end of the world.  This
includes waiting on Him patiently.  </p>

<p>We can pray about this.  We can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, what if this
does not happen?&rdquo;  But He tells us to cast our cares on Him.  </p>

<p>So this would be the response, &ldquo;Be still; stand still.&rdquo;  We
will find out in less than two weeks.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please compare Acts 2:34-35
with Matthew 22:42-45 and Hebrews 1:13.  In comparing these verses, who are the
angels in Hebrews 1:13?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Acts 2:34-35:    </p>

<p class="verse">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Until I make
thy foes thy footstool.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 22:42-45:  </p>

<p class="verse">Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
him, <i>The son </i>of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit
call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
till I make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he
his son?  </p>

<p>Hebrews 1:13 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?    </p>

<p>This is speaking of angelic beings, because Hebrews 1:14 tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">Are they not all ministering spirits&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is true that God&rsquo;s people are messengers or angels,
because that is the same word; but we are not &ldquo;ministering spirits.&rdquo;  We have
flesh and blood.  We have a body.  </p>

<p>Matthew 22 is quoting from Psalm 110.  It says in Matthew
22:43-44:  </p>

<p class="verse">He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make
thine enemies thy footstool?  </p>

<p>This is a verse that is showing that the Messiah, who would
be a son of David, would be God.  This is the point of what is being said here
and why this is quoted from Psalm 110, but it has nothing to do with angels.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Ezekiel
12:18-19?  Could this be compared to Philippians 2:12-13 and could Ezekiel 12
have something to do with the five months?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Ezekiel 12:18-19:    </p>

<p class="verse">Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with
trembling and with carefulness; And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith
the Lord JEHOVAH of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <i>and </i>of the land of
Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with
astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because
of the violence of all them that dwell therein.  </p>

<p>This would be Scripture that is looking at God&rsquo;s judgment on
the churches and congregations.  God did historically make Judah desolate and,
spiritually, He made the churches desolate.  </p>

<p>We read in Philippians 2:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling.  </p>

<p>This is what I was thinking about as I was reading Ezekiel,
as he was to eat bread and drink water with quaking and trembling.  I think
that it does relate to this, but I do not know how to relate this to the five
months.  Ezekiel seems to be connected to the judgment on the churches.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you compare Matthew
5:14-15,18 with Proverbs 3:27?  Even though we are in the 153 days, since we
are the &ldquo;light of the world,&rdquo; this is puzzling me.  I have had some discussions
with someone and he is still thinking that salvation is available because we
are not supposed to be a candle that is hid; but then Isaiah 26 comes into view
and says that we are to be hid for a moment.  Could you please explain?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Matthew 5:14-15:    </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on
a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 5:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Proverbs 3:27 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>Someone is trying to say that it is in the power of our hand
to do good because we have the Bible; however, it is not in the power of our
hand if God has indicated that there is no more salvation, which He has.  </p>

<p>So we do not have the power to go contrary to what God has
said.  Therefore, we cannot bring a Gospel of salvation to people when there is
no salvation.  </p>

<p>As far as the light of a candle, look at Revelation 18:23. 
As you mentioned in Matthew 5, the candle light is not to be hid; but He tells
us in Revelation 18:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is not referring to October 21.  This is referring to
when Babylon fell, which was May 21.  This is after the seventy years that
typify the length of the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>On that day, Babylon fell.  This is the context of
Revelation 18.  On that day, God put out the light.  The sun was darkened, the
moon would no longer give its light, and the stars fell.  Even the light of a
candle is not found.  He put out the great lights and He put out the small
lights.  There is spiritual darkness over all the earth.  </p>

<p>So it is not a matter of having our light shine for people
to see, but the believers still have the Holy Spirit within them.  Any child of
God can still be an example of a believer, and this example could still be
noticed by others.  </p>

<p>As far as the sense of it shining, this is just like the
voice of the Bride and Bridegroom that will not be heard.  We are still reading
from the Bible and we are still teaching.  The problem is not that.  The
problem is that God has sent a famine of hearing.  They cannot hear.  He has
also sent a famine of seeing.  Even though there is still the Bible, which is
the light, they cannot see it and they are going to stay in darkness.  </p>

<p><b>Question continued:</b>  So how does this relate to
Matthew 5:18?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b>:  We read in Matthew 5:18 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>What did the Law say?  The Law of the Bible said that
Judgment Day was May 21.  It said that the door shut on May 21.  This is what
the Law said and this is not going to pass, no matter how much people fight
against this.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Would the ferry boat
crossing in 2 Samuel 19:18 be a spiritual picture of the elect crossing on dry
land?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in 2 Samuel 19:18:    </p>

<p class="verse">And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down
before the king, as he was come over Jordan;  </p>

<p>To cross on a ferry boat is not the same as crossing on dry
land.  This is a different picture.  I do not know what this spiritual picture
is, but this would not be related to God drying up the sea.  This is a
completely different thing.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Comment from Chris concerning the parable of Luke 11:5-8:
</b></p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>There are a lot of children and parents
here and we all have family, and so I would like to talk about something at
this time.  </p>

<p>In Luke 11, we have read this and thought that possibly God
would still save after the shutting of the door.  I will read these verses and
then go over this quickly.  It says in Luke 11:5-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; For
a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before
him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now
shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.</p>

<p>There are three things here that relate to our day.  The
first is midnight.  It was midnight in Acts 16 when the great earthquake opened
the prison doors.  It was midnight in the book of Exodus when the firstborn
were slain.  </p>

<p>The second thing is that the door is shut.  This happened on
May 21, as that was the equivalent date to the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month of Noah&rsquo;s calendar, the day that God shut Noah and his family into the
ark.  7,000 years later on May 21 on the equivalent date, He shut the door to
Heaven.  </p>

<p>The third thing is the friend.  God is the believer&rsquo;s Friend
and Abraham was God&rsquo;s friend.  All of God&rsquo;s people are the friends of God. 
This friend says, &ldquo;My children are with me in bed,&quot; and God likens His
salvation plan to adopting sons and daughters, His children.  </p>

<p>Everything fits May 21.  It is midnight, the door is shut,
and the children are within with the father; and yet here comes this individual
who is coming at midnight.  </p>

<p>So it says in verse 6, &ldquo;I have nothing to set before him.&rdquo;  Then
we read in Luke 11:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give
thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he
needeth.  </p>

<p>I remember looking at this not too long after May 21 and
thinking that maybe, even though the door is shut, God might possibly save
someone.  But, no; there is no chance.  There is no possibility of this and
this is not teaching that.  </p>

<p>When the friend is coming, he is asking for bread; but so do
believers.  We go to the Lord every day, &ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is </i>in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread&rdquo;
is not necessarily a petition for salvation.  In this case, we are going to a
friend for bread to give to another.  </p>

<p>Just think of it this way.  We all know family and friends
and neighbors and maybe people whom we witnessed to, maybe someone at the gas
station.  They heard the message and we know that God could have saved any of
them as long as they were not in a church, any one of them.  </p>

<p>Here we are.  It is Judgment Day and the day of salvation is
over.  Are we going to God in prayer at this time?  Is this what we are
supposed to do at this point in history?  This is the importunity.  </p>

<p>It is not that this man kept knocking.  We do not read that
he knocked and knocked and knocked.  This is not like Luke 18 where the woman
&ldquo;by her continual coming&rdquo; wearies the judge.  It does not say that here.  The
importunity is that he came at all.  He came after the door was shut and after
the children were gathered, and he is still asking for bread for his son or for
his daughter or for his wife or for his neighbor.  </p>

<p>Do you see what God is indicating?  Look at it this way. 
How many people are going to God correctly at this time as they pray for other
people?  There are a lot of people who are praying, &ldquo;O God, save my uncle, save
this one, save that one,&rdquo; and they are not recognizing that it is Judgment
Day.  They are not recognizing that the door is shut.  </p>

<p>But this is not how God wants people to come at this time. 
He wanted us to come that way all the way through history until the door shut,
but they are coming thinking that all of God&rsquo;s children are not with Him and
that the door is open.  Here, that is not the case.  His children are with
Him.  The door is shut.  It is midnight.  It is judgment.  </p>

<p>So here come God&rsquo;s people, and only God&rsquo;s people will pray
this way, and they are going in recognition of all of the truths that they have
learned from the Bible, &ldquo;Lord, I know where we are.  I know that You are not
saving anymore, but I pray for my daughter and I pray for my son, not that You
will have mercy, but having had mercy, may You have mercy.&rdquo;  We are going back
in recognition that God would have had to have saved them prior to the door
shutting.  </p>

<p>Notice what we read in Luke 11:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he
is his friend&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is not because of this relationship between God and His
people.  This is not why He is going to grant his request.  It is not because
of friendship.  What is the reason?  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as
he needeth.  </p>

<p>This is great encouragement.  This is great encouragement. 
How bold and how brash to come in the Day of Judgment, to come beseeching God
still at this time!  </p>

<p>Here we are just a couple a weeks from the end of all
things, and yet God is encouraging us, &ldquo;Okay; it is for your importunity.  It
is not that you keep knocking and knocking and knocking, but it is the fact
that you are coming at all and in a proper way in understanding the day we are
in.&rdquo;  Well, I think that this is great encouragement for us that we should
continue to pray.  </p>

<p>God just saved a great multitude and He is in complete
control of the outworking of this in each individual&rsquo;s life.  He has done this
in our lives.  In other words, God could have saved someone, they are saved,
and He could allow them to remain pretty much as they were so no one, not even
themselves, would know anything had happened.  This is within His ability to
do, is it not?  Why would He do this?  </p>

<p>One reason is because He would want His people to pray.  He
would want them to pray.  We can go to Him and we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I am not
the judge, I am not the discerner, and I know that from all outward appearances
that there has been no change in these people whom I have been praying for even
throughout these five months.  But I do know that You could have saved them,
and so I am going to come to You in an importunistic way and continue to pray.&rdquo; 
This is just something in which I think God is encouraging all of us to keep
praying as we continue on.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you compare Daniel
7:11-12 and Revelation 19:20-21 in relation to Satan at this time?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Daniel 7:11-12:    </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake: I beheld <i>even </i>till the beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the
beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for
a season and time.  </p>

<p><b>Question continued</b>:  I know that you have spoken
about this in the past and I believe that this is referring to May 21<sup>st</sup>
when Satan was decommissioned from the church and from the world, and yet we
still have his other personalities that continue during these five months.  Am
I correct on this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>He still exists.  The beast that rose
up out of the sea had seven heads and ten horns.  If one beast is slain, there
are still other beasts.  </p>

<p>When it says that he was slain, that is referring to May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
His dominion was taken away but Satan himself still exists, so this is why it
says that &ldquo;their lives were prolonged for a season and time,&rdquo; which is these
five months.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 19:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the
mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast
alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain
with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which <i>sword </i>proceeded out
of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.  </p>

<p><b>Question continued</b>:  Would this be referring to
10/21?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It is both.  We read in verse 20 that
the beast is taken and thrown into the lake of fire.  That is May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
Then in verse 21 where it speaks of &ldquo;the remnant,&rdquo; this is a word that is used
in other places, like we read in Revelation 9 where it speaks of &ldquo;the rest of
the men.&rdquo;  This is looking at the unsaved people of the world.  </p>

<p>The beast and the false prophet would be Satan and the
church.  Then &ldquo;the rest of the men&rdquo; are all of the unsaved who are under God&rsquo;s
wrath, but they wait until October 21.  That is when they will be destroyed.  </p>

<p><b>Question continued</b>:  The first aspect of judgment
began on 5/21.  In Daniel, it refers to more than one beast.  In Revelation 19,
one beast is thrown into the lake of fire.  This would be the destruction of
Satan because he was a defeated foe on 5/21.  Is there any possibility that in
between 5/21 and now, that what we read in Revelation 19 is not going to happen
on 10/21?  Is there still a time period between the death of these other beasts
and the first beast?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Revelation 19:21 is also speaking of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom.  Remember that in Revelation 13, two beasts were in view. 
One beast came out of the sea and showed itself from the earth.  We read in
Revelation 13:11:    </p>

<p class="verse">And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.  </p>

<p>It was actually the second beast who took his seat in the
temple.  We read of the first beast in Revelation 13:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and
nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him&hellip;  </p>

<p>So he is picturing Satan&rsquo;s rule over all of the earth.  The
second beast has &ldquo;horns like a lamb&rdquo; but speaks &ldquo;as a dragon.&rdquo;  This identifies
more with the church.  </p>

<p>The beast was put down on May 21; but when God says in
Daniel 7 that they had their &ldquo;dominion taken away: yet their lives were
prolonged,&rdquo; this is basically looking at the fact that Satan is not dead.  He
did not cease to exist.  He is still continuing on.  He can still come against
God&rsquo;s people.  But on the last day, he will be destroyed.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
