<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Haman was hanged on a
particular date and it was a very significant date.  Haman&rsquo;s ten sons were also
hanged on a particular date and then hung a second time to be shamed.  If I am
correct, that was on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month. 
What is the significance of this?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>There are a lot of hangings in the
book of Esther.  The two doorkeepers were hung.  Haman was hung.  Then later,
Haman&rsquo;s ten sons were hung.  We do know that the Bible tells us, &ldquo;Cursed <i>is </i>every
one that hangeth on a tree.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So these hangings were indicating the judgment of God.  The
two doorkeepers were representing the church.  Haman was representing Satan,
especially as he was given authority and rule over the church and over the
world.  Then the ten sons were also typifying Satan, just like the beast and
the ten horns in Revelation are Satan.  It is just another way of saying the
same thing.  </p>

<p>The interesting thing in the book of Esther is that Haman was
killed on one day, the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, but his
ten sons, which we would liken to the ten horns of the beast, were killed
months later.  They were killed on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of Adar.  Then they
are killed a second time by hanging on the 14<sup>th</sup> day.  That is, they
killed them on the 13<sup>th</sup> day.  These were the enemies of the Jews. 
On the next day when Esther made request to slay once again in Shushan, they
hung them.  In a sense, they were killed twice, which is pointing to the second
death.  But why the difference?  </p>

<p>We would never understand this if we held the traditional
view that many have had all through history and as many are now going back to. 
Some are going back to this since May 21 did not happen according to their
idea.  They are saying that Christ will come and that will be it.  They are
saying that the day He comes will be Judgment Day.  Some are saying that
Judgment Day was not May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>If this is true, then how do we explain Daniel 7:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
days did sit, whose garment <i>was </i>white as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne <i>was like </i>the fiery flame, <i>and </i>his
wheels <i>as </i>burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before
him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. I
beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I
beheld <i>even </i>till the beast was slain&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Satan, the beast of Revelation 13.  It
is Judgment Day.  He is slain.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.  </p>

<p>It is all done, right?  Everything is done and it is the end
of the world.  However, look at the next verse, Daniel 7:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
taken away&hellip;    </p>

<p>That is, they had no more authority.  Then it continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.  </p>

<p>How is this possible?  Let us say that Christ comes
tomorrow.  If He comes tomorrow and it is the day that is being discussed here
where the beast is taken and destroyed, what would that prolong &ldquo;for a season
and time&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Nothing fits this but one thing.  The beast was taken and
killed on May 21, 2011.  The dominion of the ten sons of Haman in the book of
Esther, who typify the ten horns of the beast, is removed.  They have no more
authority, &ldquo;yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We do know that the ten sons died about ten months later in
the 12<sup>th</sup> month on the 13<sup>th</sup> day.  Then this was just
reinforced on the 14<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>I am glad that you brought
this up.  You talked about this the other night and I started reading on in the
book of Daniel.  In Daniel 7 from verse 20 on and after, it talks about the ten
horns again.  It looks like it is out of sequence because the earlier verses
look like the end, but then it picks up again with the ten horns.  What I am
basically saying is that it looks like another time sequence is coming into
focus here, but I thought that we had already studied this before as
representing something that had happened in the past.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I have not done a verse-by-verse study
in Daniel 7.  I do know that in the verses we just read, it is Judgment Day. 
We read of the &ldquo;Ancient of days&rdquo; and then the judgment on the beast, who can
only be Satan.  But even though it is Judgment Day, there is some sort of
extension of time for the rest of the beasts.  </p>

<p>God gives many names to Satan.  He is the devil, the dragon,
the beast.  We read of four of his names in Revelation 20.  They are all just
focusing on some aspect of his personality or of the rule that God has given
him.  The ten horns are him, also.  </p>

<p>So in the book of Esther, Haman is killed, who represents
the devil, on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, but his ten
sons continue.  They also represent the devil, but Satan is not dead.  </p>

<p>The spirit being, who is the devil, is not dead.  He has not
ceased to be.  It is only in the way in which God is viewing him that it is as
though he were killed, like a king who has been put down, and yet he continues
to exist.  The &ldquo;ten sons of Haman&rdquo; is what teaches us this.  Satan will
continue until the last day.  </p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #2</i>): 
</b>Where it says that they would be &ldquo;prolonged for a season and time,&rdquo; we had
looked before at the &ldquo;time, and times, and half a time.&rdquo;  Is there any specific
time understanding that we can get out of this as far as &ldquo;season and time&rdquo;?   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; I have not been able to see
anything.  The word &ldquo;season&rdquo; is actually most often translated as &ldquo;time,&rdquo; and
the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; is most often translated as &ldquo;time/times.&rdquo;  But I have not been
able to see anything.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Earlier, we were looking at
how Esther had the first feast and then she called for a second feast, and we
were not able to figure out what was going on with that.  What I noticed was
that Esther had asked specifically for Haman to come to the second feast.  God
tells us that this resulted in Haman&rsquo;s pride overtaking him.  Esther, who is a
picture of a believer, was inviting Haman to the feast.  We all know that
Satan&rsquo;s goal has been to wrestle just one person out of the kingdom of God, because
he would then win.  When Haman leaves that first feast, he must have been
thinking that he had one of God&rsquo;s elect in his pocket in the sense that Esther
was choosing him.  In this sense, this could be a picture of God&rsquo;s purpose.  It
could be to show that even though Satan thinks that he is a winner, God has
given him a false delusion and things are going to turn against him.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Thanks.  That is an interesting
thought.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you compare Joel
2:1-5 with Revelation 9:7?  I think that Revelation 9:7 is a commentary on Joel
2:1-5.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Joel 2:1-5:    </p>

<p class="verse">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of JEHOVAH
cometh, for <i>it is </i>nigh at hand; A day of darkness and of gloominess, a
day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains:
a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall
be any more after it, <i>even </i>to the years of many generations. A fire
devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land <i>is </i>as
the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and
nothing shall escape them. The appearance of them <i>is </i>as the appearance
of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. Like the noise of chariots on
the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that
devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 9:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the shapes of the locusts <i>were </i>like unto horses
prepared unto battle; and on their heads <i>were </i>as it were crowns like
gold, and their faces <i>were </i>as the faces of men.  </p>

<p>I think that you are correct.  This does relate to what we
are reading in Joel.  This is a description of God&rsquo;s judgment coming on the
world.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  What about Revelation 9:9?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  We read in Revelation 9:9 where this is
speaking of the locusts:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
the sound of their wings <i>was </i>as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle.  </p>

<p>This matches what we read in Joel.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Does this mean that judgment is
coming on the unsaved of the world?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Yes.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Esther 2:6-7 refers to Jeconiah. 
Jeconiah is also called Coniah in Jeremiah 22:24 where God says that he was as
&ldquo;the signet upon my right hand.&rdquo;  In Esther, it is the king&rsquo;s ring that seals
the petitions.  Do you see any comparison?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Esther 2:6-7:    </p>

<p class="verse">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon had carried away. And he brought up Hadassah, that <i>is, </i>Esther&hellip; 
</p>

<p>No; I do not see any comparison.  Here, God is just giving
us a historical reference.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Esther 2:5-6, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Now </i>in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose
name <i>was </i>Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
a Benjamite; Who had been carried away from Jerusalem&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Kish who was carried away during the
reign of Jeconiah when he was carried away.  This gives us the date.  I think
that Jeconiah was carried away around 600-597 B.C.  </p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s ring or the signet was used to seal decrees and
to indicate that something was from the king and that, therefore, it was not to
be altered or changed.  But I do not think that this relates to what we would
read later in Esther.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you read Habakkuk
2:3?  Some say that we cannot know the day of the Lord, but does this verse not
imply that His tarrying is for an appointed time and that it is from one point
to another point?  Does this not imply that we knew the first time and that we
will know the second time?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Hebrews 10:37 is a quote from Habakkuk
2:3.  We read in Habakkuk 2:3:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the vision <i>is </i>yet for an appointed time, but at the
end it [<i>he</i>] shall speak, and not lie: though it [<i>he</i>] tarry, wait
for it [<i>him</i>]; because it [<i>he</i>] will surely come, it [<i>he</i>]
will not tarry.  </p>

<p>This says &ldquo;it&rdquo; but it really should be &ldquo;he/him.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The interesting thing about this verse is that it says He
tarries and then it says that He does not tarry, and so what fits this?  </p>

<p>On one hand, it has to appear as though He should have
come.  Yet on the other hand, that was not the actually date.  He has a set
time in which He will come.  This fits with what we just experienced with May 21, 2011.  And so, yes; I think that you are right.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>What is the last day?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>What we can say is that we have a lock
to May 21 due to the book of Esther.  From there, we just simply follow the
calendar that leads to Purim.  In 2012, Purim comes in March.  </p>

<p>The interesting thing is that Purim occurs over a period of
several days.  There was one day that was chosen by lot and that was the 13<sup>th</sup>,
but they also slew in Shushan on the 14<sup>th</sup>.  Following each day of
slaying their enemies, there was a day of rest.  </p>

<p>So the Jews in the provinces slew their enemies on the 13<sup>th</sup>
and then they rested on the 14<sup>th</sup>.  In Shushan only, they slew on the
13<sup>th</sup> and the 14<sup>th</sup> and then they rested on the 15<sup>th</sup>. 
</p>

<p>This gives us a three-day span for the Feast of Purim, which
definitely means that everyone in the world would be on some portion of this
feast at the same time; but I do not think that we can know which day.  According
to how God has laid this out, it could be the 13<sup>th</sup> or it could be
the 14<sup>th</sup> or it could be the 15<sup>th</sup>, and He does not really
get into any particular hour at all.  We do not have that information.  </p>

<p>People ask me, &ldquo;How sure are you?  Are you 100% sure?  Are
you trying to be absolute again?&rdquo;  All I can say is that we are getting this
from the Bible.  If you can see how Purim locks into May 21, the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, you also can just follow that to the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of Adar and you will be able to see the timeline.  </p>

<p>We are going to stop here.  </p>
