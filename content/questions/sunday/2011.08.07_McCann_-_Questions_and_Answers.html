<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Concerning the 200 million
who are currently judging, it says in Matthew that &ldquo;The men of Nineveh shall
rise in judgment with this generation.&rdquo;  Is this going on right now?                                                                                                                                                     </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; this would be on the last day, the
day of the resurrection.  This comes at the last day and this also is a
condemnation when this happens.  But it does not mean that we have to wait for
them.  God is pouring out His wrath all through this period.  Then, finally, on
the last day, on the very last day, this is going to happen.  There will be an
end of the world and there will be a resurrection of the dead.  This will also
be a judgment, a condemnation on those who were unsaved and who will finally be
destroyed.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>What exactly is the torment
that we read about in Revelation 9?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The torment is that there is no
salvation.  This information slays those who are in the churches.  This is more
torment than for the rest of the world who may not be saved, since most of them
are not.  Still, we have hope and the people out in the world can even have
hope that maybe we are someone whom Christ saved prior to ending the day of
salvation.  So this eases their torment some.    </p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):  </b>Also in
Revelation 9, it mentions that they will seek death and not find it.  So,
obviously, Satan and his minions are being judged also.  Satan, as far as I
know, has never sought salvation.  There is no provision for this.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Right.  The judgment on him is not a
loss of salvation.  The judgment on him is a blow to his pride.  This is where
he lives.  He is extremely proud and desired to be like God.  Who placed him in
the churches?  God did.  Following this, God takes this from him.  This is
where he will suffer and he will experience God&rsquo;s wrath.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>You have talked about prior
to May 21 that someone might have become saved and not realized this.  The
Bible teaches that if anyone is in Christ, &ldquo;<i>he is </i>a new creature: old
things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&rdquo;  Are there any
examples in the Bible that actually show this, where someone does not realize
at first that they are saved?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>What about David&rsquo;s child?  He was
saved as a baby and he never knew it.  I am sure that there are other examples,
but this is the first one that pops up.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Are the goats those who
thought that they were Christians?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The goats are the unsaved and, yes, I
think that, in particular, the Bible does emphasize that they should have been
doing some things in ministering the Gospel.  So in this sense, yes.  </p>

<p>Jesus says Matthew 25:41-43:    </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: For
I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no
drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not:
sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. </p>

<p>So in all of these statements, there is an implication that
they should have done these things, like the sheep did do them as God moved in
His people to share the Gospel with the world.  This is what all of these
statements are getting at.  In this sense, it seems to be focused here a little
bit more on those in the churches.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I was at a car wash the
other day when a man noticed the decals that I have on my car that point to a
Family Radio station.  He came up to me and asked, &ldquo;Do you listen to Family
Radio?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Yes; how about you?&rdquo;  And he said, &ldquo;I used to.&rdquo;  So I started
encouraging him to listen again to Family Radio.  Then he stated that there was
no earthquake.  [<i>Note: cannot understand what this person is
saying&hellip;something in relation to an earthquake all over the earth.</i>]  So he
listened to me and I was surprised.  </p>

<p>In relation to the 200 million, &ldquo;two hundred thousand
thousand,&rdquo; we used to think that the unsaved dead would be included in this.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Right.  That is a good point.  We had
thought that the 200 million would be coming forth like horsemen when it was
the day of the rapture and the day of the resurrection.  Those who were
previously dead but saved, we thought they would be included in that number. 
Obviously, the dead did not rise on May 21.  </p>

<p>So these 200 million are identified with Babylon, which
identifies with the 23-year great tribulation, and they are loosed from Babylon. 
This means that they completely identify with the 23-year period, which is even
better news for us because we were thinking that 1 in 70 would be saved when we
took into account the population of the whole earth throughout history being
about 14 billion.  200 million would be 1 in 70.  But, actually, in looking at
that language and since the resurrection of the dead did not take place on May
21, these 200 million are identified with this present population of nearly 7
billion; and so it is more like 1 in 35.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question/Comment:  </b>I would like to
make a comment concerning the Friday Night Bible Study.  During J. R. Carman&rsquo;s
study, he pointed out that there were many books printed all throughout history,
and yet there is one Book that has stood out, which is the Bible.  </p>

<p>This reminded me of when I try to share with people and I
tell people that this Book is so different.  It is unique and one-of-a-kind,
because it is dealing with the human heart.  Our hearts have not been right
since the fall of mankind into sin.  </p>

<p>This is just my comment.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Okay.  Thank you.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>The Bible speaks of the
number 666.  When we take this number, which is two-thirds, of those
two-thirds, does this consist of one-third of the unsaved in the churches and
one-third of the unsaved of the world?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I have never thought of it like this. 
We know that this is a symbolic number, because way more people are unsaved
than who are saved.  The number who are saved is actually 2-3% of the
population; not one-third.  There is one-third who profess that they are saved,
about 2 billion who call themselves Christians.  But I have never thought of it
like this, so I cannot really say yes or no.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>How should one be in
regards to Bible study these days?  I am not very good at doing this and it
does not seem like I have that much energy or desire to do this, but 2 Timothy
2:15 says, &ldquo;Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not
to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&rdquo;  The Bible says to do this,
so I hope that this question helps others as well.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes; you are right.  Actually, God
commands us to read the Bible.  In 1 Timothy 4:13, we read:    </p>

<p class="verse">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
doctrine.</p>

<p>So God commands us all, &ldquo;Read!&rdquo;  He does not say here how
much we have to read or how often, but He does say, &ldquo;Till I come&rdquo;; and so this
should be part of the lifestyle of the child of God to read the Bible.  </p>

<p>I know that there are some people who cannot read and that
there are some people who do not like to read.  I think that some people have
been spoiled by our age of technology with the videos and everything like this,
and they do not have any patience for reading.  </p>

<p>We can thank God that there are CD&rsquo;s that can be played. 
People can go to Family Radio and listen to the Bible reading.  They can listen
to the programming and they can have this playing in their homes or in their
cars or on their computers 24 hours.  </p>

<p>So we do not have to always have this Book in front of us,
but it would be good for us to read the Bible.  This is always to our benefit. 
If we do not read the Bible, then who does this hurt?  This could hurt your
family.  This could hurt the rest of your family because you are probably not
going to be as you should be.  You are not going to have the strength to draw
on for the things that you have to do in your family as a husband or as a wife,
or as anyone else.  But, for the most part, you are hurting yourself.  </p>

<p>There is strength available, encouragement available,
comfort available.  Everything that we need is not in the refrigerator and it
is not in the stores.  It is in the Bible.  This is the one needful thing.  </p>

<p>In Luke 10, we read of Mary.  Jesus is commending reading or
listening to Him.  When we read the Bible, we are listening to Christ.  It says
in Luke 10:39-42:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet,
and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to
him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto
her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</p>

<p>This means that Martha is anxious.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
which shall not be taken away from her.</p>

<p>What was the solution for Martha&rsquo;s anxiety?  It was for her
to sit down at the feet of Jesus, next to her sister, and listen.  This is what
would calm her down.  </p>

<p>When we finally get back up from doing this, we will be able
to do a much better job at whatever it was that we were doing.  </p>

<p>Someone, like Martha, can be walking around with a mind full
of anger at her sister.  Something has to be going on in our thoughts.  If it
is not the Word of God, what is it going to be?  It is normally not going to be
anything good.  </p>

<p>So if we keep our thoughts on things above, this will just
help us in every way imaginable in this life.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question/Comment:  </b>What you have been
speaking of just now is exactly what I wanted to say.  If we were to get all of
the young children who have just been saved in this last 23 years, there is so
much that they do not know as they are being chastised.  I chastise my children
and they need to know why I am doing this.  As they stumble through the sins
that they have and they are chastised in some severe situations, they get
comfort by constantly reading the Bible.  </p>

<p>Prior to this, concerning the besetting sins that they may
have, they only need to go to the Bible.  They only need the regular reading of
the Word of God, right in the morning, right at lunch time, etc.  This helps us
with those besetting sins.  As He purifies us, He will lead us to those verses
that will help us with this.  </p>

<p>In these troubled times with the young Christian who have
been saved, they are really a little mixed up in the sense of the people that
they see constantly buying brand new things, a brand new car, a brand new
house, etc.  Here they are over here with nothing and yet they are being
chastised all day, but then God tells us that the saved already have their
reward.  They need to find out these things only from the Word of God.  </p>

<p>As we see more sin in the world as a child of God, we just
basically shudder at what we see, &ldquo;I was just like that,&rdquo; and we are still just
like that.  Being constantly in the Word will keep us away from the ugliness of
what the world has to offer.  So we need to read the Bible more than we have
ever and turn to God to give us guidance.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Thank you.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>My question is in regards
to Jude 22-25.  How does this tie-in to the end times?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Jude 22-25:    </p>

<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others
save with fear, pulling <i>them </i>out of the fire; hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and
to present <i>you </i>faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy, To the only wise God our Saviour&hellip;  </p>

<p>What this is referring to is compassion.  This has to do
with sharing the Gospel with people.  God could bless the sharing of His Word. 
In doing so, He pulls them &ldquo;out of the fire,&rdquo; out from under His wrath.  </p>

<p>At this point, this is kind of hard for us to get hold of,
but there is no one now who is unsaved who will become saved.  We are in
Judgment Day.  What do we expect?  It is Judgment Day.  This is a judgment. 
What was the judgment if not this?  </p>

<p>We were saying that the door would shut, and God shut the
door.  We are not saying anything new.  We are saying what we were saying all
along.  The only thing that is different is that we are here.  </p>

<p>I can understand how some people are dealing with this. 
Since we are here and we have to talk with family and friends and neighbors and
strangers as we still have to react and to communicate, it would be much better
if there was still the possibility of salvation that we could share.  But, no;
we have to be honest and truthful concerning what the Bible teaches, and so
there is no salvation now.  </p>

<p>This is just as we were saying.  All along, we told people
that they had until May 21 and then the door would shut, and the door has
shut.  Now all we are doing is looking at the consequences of this and seeing
things in a different light, because we are here.  </p>

<p>This means that some of the language; for example, &ldquo;in the
presence of the holy angels,&rdquo; has to be looked at again.  Then we see how we
fit, and we do.  God has said that He would judge the world with His saints,
and He is presently doing this.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
