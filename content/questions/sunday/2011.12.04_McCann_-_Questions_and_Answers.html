  <li><span class="time">07:53</span> Does &ldquo;water&rdquo; mean different things in different places in the Bible, or does it have a general meaning?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">09:55</span> I do not know if there is any way that this could tie in; but if the end were actually to occur at the time of the Passover, then that would really tie into the crossing over into the Promised Land.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">18:13</span> Continued from Question #7:  Are you saying that the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was at the end of that period?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:05</span> Could you take a look at Acts 5:38-39?  Does this tie into our day?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">21:18</span> In Daniel 4, we read about Nebuchadnezzar.  There is a dream that Daniel interpreted for him where he was going to lose his kingdom.  Later, he gave glory to God and then he regained that kingdom.  Does this mean that Satan could still be ruling in the churches as of October 21?  </li>

  <li><span class="time">24:42</span> Last night, a thought just came to my mind about a verse that says that Jesus also died for the world.  Then I thought that maybe this is why the unsaved of the world would not have to suffer eternally.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">27:43</span> In Zechariah, you were talking about the rest.  What kind of rest did you have in view?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">29:08</span> Continued from Question #13:  But, spiritually, does this mean that those who do not believe the same things we believe are going to become tares, just like those in the churches?  </li>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We are still working on trying to get
the question and answer period set up to go either throughout the week or just
on certain days of the week.  We are going to try to do this through Paltalk
and Skype.  We are still working on this.  Hopefully, we will get this done
quickly.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>We were talking about
starting earlier.  Could you elaborate on this?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I did not get a chance to talk to
Robert.  Bob was thinking that we could start at 10:00 A.M. rather than at 10:30 A.M. like we used to.  We are going to begin the hymn sing and Scripture reading at 10:00 A.M. next week and that will keep us from going so late into the afternoon.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>How does Haggai 2 fit in
with the 23 days and the five months, because there is work going on and there
is the shaking?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Look at Haggai 1, because in Zechariah
God is linking the verses that we are reading in Zechariah 1 following the fifteenth
verse of Haggai 1 because of the 5-month gap.  </p>

<p>Remember that God can have multiple pictures and ongoing
pictures.  They still had to build the temple.  They still had work to do.  But
in this case, there are 23 days of famine followed by the stirring up of Zerubbabel
and Joshua.  Then that chapter ends after 23 days on the 24<sup>th</sup> day of
the 6<sup>th</sup> month; and then five months later, we come to Zechariah 1.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>I am wondering about
Genesis 8 and the 27<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month when all went
out of the ark.  This would be in May 2012.  I know that we are looking at
Purim, but have you thought about this, too?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We are trying to look at everything
and the end of the ark or the historical end of the whole flood event happened
in Genesis 8:13-14:    </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
first <i>month, </i>the first <i>day </i>of the month, the waters were dried up
from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and,
behold, the face of the ground was dry. And in the second month, on the seven
and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.  </p>

<p>A lot of the time, we have looked at this and we have
thought of 370 days.  This is because we know that the flood began the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month and this is over a year later on the 27<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  We think that it was 30-day months and we add
10 days from 17 to 27 and we say that it was 370 days, but not necessarily. 
This calendar relates to the Hebrew calendar.  </p>

<p>Mike Cook did an interesting analysis of this and he
demonstrated how this could have been exactly one year later, even though it
seems to be several days over a year; and so there is a possibility.  </p>

<p>I would say that if Purim were not the fulfillment of what
God is looking at, this would probably be the last possibility before we would
have to say that we were way off on something and would have to go back to the
drawing board.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Do we identify in our
current situation with Nehemiah 2:3?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Nehemiah 2:3 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, <i>lieth
</i>waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?  </p>

<p>No; I do not think that this is the picture.  </p>

<p>Remember that Nehemiah was about to make a request to build
the wall.  That wall would take 52 days to build and the Bible speaks of walls
of salvation.  So this had everything to with beginning the project to build
the spiritual wall &ndash; this is the way that we could look at this &ndash; within a
period of 52 days, which relates to the &ldquo;acceptable year of the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>That is not our situation.  We are not looking to build or
to bring people into the Kingdom or for God to evangelize the world and save
all of His elect.  We are not in that situation right now.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I am a little concerned in
regards to the Mayan calendar.  How can it be that we could fall in line in
exactly the same year as this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I thought of the same thing and I
understand what you are asking.  Let us say that Christ returns in the year
2012 and that also happens to be the year that the Mayan calendar comes to an
end.  Well, that would not have anything to do with that.  </p>

<p>I think that the Mayan calendar ends in December of 2012. 
As far as I know, that calendar is not even discussing the end of the world. 
That is just what people have derived from it.  </p>

<p>God has His own plan and His own purposes, and so I just do
not think that it plays any kind of part in this.  It does not really come into
view at all.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I wanted to ask you about
water in the Bible.  We see God destroying the world with water and then we see
God making water come from a rock to provide life, I guess, to some degree.  Then
we see God taking the Israelites through the Red Sea.  Does &ldquo;water&rdquo; mean
different things in different places in the Bible, or does it have a general
meaning?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>That is a good question.  This is why
we have to be careful when we are reading the Bible that we do not come up with
a definition for a word or for an idea and apply it every time we find it.  </p>

<p>For instance, the flood waters represent God&rsquo;s judgment, but
also the Word of God.  The &ldquo;water out of the rock&rdquo; represents the Gospel going forth. 
As Moses struck the rock, Moses is a figure of the law of God.  When Christ
died for the sins of His people, Christ was struck by the law.  Because of
this, the Gospel could go out into the world.  </p>

<p>So in every case, and there are many other places because we
read about water everywhere in the Bible, we look at the context.  We look at
how it is being used.  </p>

<p>For instance, the Bible tells us that &ldquo;the wicked <i>are </i>like
the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.&rdquo; 
Here God is typifying the unsaved people of the world as a troubled sea, a wavy
sea.  But then the Bible also speaks of calm waters; and so we have to look at
each place where that word is found.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>As I have been reading and
looking back in the Old Testament about the crossing over of the Jordan, I know
that this happens in the first month of the year.  Maybe I ought to mention
that it just keeps coming up to me that maybe that extra month might be
something related to 13 or the super fullness.  I do not know if there is any
way that this could tie in; but if the end were actually to occur at the time
of the Passover, then that would really tie into the crossing over into the
Promised Land.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not think so, because the
Passover identifies with Christ on the cross and giving Himself as the Lamb of
God and the Passover was fulfilled at that point; but thanks because this gives
me an opportunity to talk about this.  </p>

<p>There were three feasts.  One was the Passover, which was
fulfilled spiritually when Jesus went to the cross, because He is &ldquo;the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The second feast was the Feast of Pentecost.  Remember that
Acts 2 says &ldquo;when the day of Pentecost was fully come.&rdquo;  This was when the Holy
Spirit was poured out.  </p>

<p>Was the Feast of Pentecost fulfilled on that day in 33
A.D.?  No; it was an ongoing fulfillment.  This is because throughout the whole
church age, the firstfruits were brought in and Revelation speaks of 144,000
who are identified as firstfruits.  It was like the kick-off in Acts 2, and
then the whole firstfruits of the church age were brought in; and so the
fulfillment of that second feast was of an ongoing nature over a period of
1,955 years.  </p>

<p>The third feast is the Feast of Tabernacles.  How is the
Feast of Tabernacles to be fulfilled?  What fulfills the Feast of Tabernacles? 
We thought, obviously, the end of the world; and, obviously, we were wrong. 
Something else fulfills the Feast of Tabernacles.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Zechariah 14 and we will see here how God
speaks of this feast.  We read in Zechariah 14:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that </i>every one that is left of
all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year
to worship the King, JEHOVAH of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.  </p>

<p>You keep the feast &ldquo;from year to year.&rdquo;  This always
bothered me.  Why do you keep this feast &ldquo;from year to year&rdquo;?  If the keeping
of this feast was fulfilled on the last day, why do you have to go up and keep
it &ldquo;from year to year&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Let us go on.  It says in Zechariah 14:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, <i>that </i>whoso will not come up of <i>all </i>the
families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, JEHOVAH of hosts,
even upon them shall be no rain.  </p>

<p>Let us think about the great tribulation of 23 years.  For
the first 2300 evening/mornings, there was no rain.  Virtually, no one was
being saved in the world.  God says that this was necessary and then after that
is when the sanctuary was to be cleansed.  We read about this in Daniel 8.  </p>

<p>Remember that Mr. Camping did a very good study of
explaining what this meant.  After that 2300-day period, which ended in
September of 1994, the sanctuary was cleansed in the sense that from that point
everyone who became saved would go right up.  They would go right into the Kingdom
 of God.  </p>

<p>It was not a gathering anymore, because God had already
ended the church age, even though we did not know this.  So this was not a
gathering into the churches to collect the believers anymore.  God was working
one-on-one with individuals during the latter rain period when He saved them. 
When you become saved, you are seated &ldquo;in heavenly <i>places </i>in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;  You go up.  According to Ephesians, you go up to be with the Lord.  </p>

<p>If you do not go up, if you are not saved, you experience no
rain.  Notice Zechariah 14:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And if the family of Egypt go not up&hellip;    </p>

<p>Who became Egypt during the great tribulation?  It was the
church according to Revelation 11.  Spiritually, God identified the church as Egypt
and Sodom &ldquo;where also our Lord was crucified,&rdquo; and He was actually crucified
outside Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that <i>have
</i>no <i>rain; </i>there shall be the plague, wherewith JEHOVAH will smite the
heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.  </p>

<p>So, in other words, what God did with the fulfillment of the
Feast of Pentecost was that it was of an ongoing nature beginning on the day of
Pentecost in 33 A.D. and it coincided with the first outpouring of the Holy
Spirit.  </p>

<p>The fulfillment of the Feast of Tabernacles occurred in
September of 1994 when God began the latter rain period and it would be an
ongoing keeping of the feast, an ongoing feast as the rain would fall in the
world.  </p>

<p>The churches refused to listen to God.  They remained where
they were, and so they had no rain.  This is why it said that you had to go up
to keep the feast from year to year, because it was over 17 years that this
particular feast was being held.  </p>

<p>Remember again that Mr. Camping did a study identifying the
Feast of Tabernacles with the feast of the Bible.  This is because we were
learning so much information over this period of time that the Scriptures were
opening up.  </p>

<p>How could we have kept the feast of the Bible when the Feast
of Tabernacles was pointing to October 21 in 2011 on a particular day?  Well,
it was not.  </p>

<p>We were keeping the feast of the Bible.  We were observing
the Feast of Tabernacles from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month
in September of 1994 throughout and until the latter rain ended.  That was the
keeping of this feast; and the last day of &ldquo;that great <i>day </i>of the feast&rdquo;
Jesus cried out and said, &ldquo;If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink&rdquo;
because the door was about to shut.  So it was during that period of time.  </p>

<p>In other words, we were incorrect in taking the date of
October 21 and thinking that it was the fulfillment of the end of the world. 
Of course, this is why we are still here.  </p>

<p>The Feast of Tabernacles was not meant to be fulfilled by
Christ coming on the very last day of the earth&rsquo;s existence.  But like the
Feast of Pentecost, it was meant to be an ongoing feast over a period of time
while God accomplished His purposes.  </p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #7</i>): 
</b>Are you saying that the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was at the end
of that period?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I understand what you are saying.  I
do not understand the gap of the five months in relationship to this.  </p>

<p>We know that the great tribulation, along with the latter
rain, ended on May 21; but then the Feast of Tabernacles came on October 21,
five months later.  Right now, I do not understand that.  </p>

<p>Right now, as far as I understand this, the &ldquo;last day&rdquo; would
relate to the day before Judgment Day, May 21.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you take a look at
Acts 5:38-39?  Does this tie into our day?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Acts 5:38-39:    </p>

<p class="verse">And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: But
if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight
against God.  </p>

<p>This relates to any group, but we have to consider who is
saying this.  It was Gamaliel who stood up and said this.  He was a Pharisee. 
There was a big upheaval amongst the Pharisees concerning the Christians, and
so he was actually speaking some words of calm.  He calms the people down so
that they do not continue to harass and kill these men.  He says, &ldquo;Just let
them alone.  If it is of God, then you cannot do anything about it.  If it is
of men, it will come to nought.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is true of anything.  What God does is forever and what
men do eventually fades away.  That is the vanity of this world and of false
religions and gospels also.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Daniel 4, we read about
Nebuchadnezzar.  There is a dream that Daniel interpreted for him where he was
going to lose his kingdom.  Later, he gave glory to God and then he regained
that kingdom.  Does this mean that Satan could still be ruling in the churches
as of October 21?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; it does not mean that.  I know
what you are referring to.  A lot of people wonder about Nebuchadnezzar because
of what he says in Daniel 4:34:    </p>

<p class="verse">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most
High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion <i>is
</i>an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom <i>is </i>from generation to
generation:  </p>

<p>We know that he was not a saved man, that he never became a
saved man, and that he was a type of Satan.  </p>

<p>It is true that in this historical context, he was restored
to his kingdom; but this would be about the only place where a picture of Satan
is restored; and I do not think that this relates to the day that we are living
in.  </p>

<p>What this does relate to in some ways is Haman.  In Haman&rsquo;s
pride, he went into the king thinking, &ldquo;Who would the king delight to honor
more than me?&rdquo;  But then the king said, &ldquo;Okay; go and honor Mordecai the Jew.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>So then there was Haman taking Mordecai on horseback through
the streets; and what was Haman saying?  He was saying, &ldquo;Thus shall be done
unto the man whom the king delights to honor.&rdquo;  He was speaking good things
about Mordecai and good things about the king, because he was forced to.  </p>

<p>This is all part of the judgment of God; and so here, too,
as far as this relates to Satan, it would have that kind of aspect to it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>During the week, are you
hoping to do questions and answers over Paltalk also?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I will not be on Paltalk ever again,
personally.  I have had too much trouble on Paltalk.  That is why I said to
Bill, &ldquo;If it is going to be on Paltalk, then I cannot do it.&rdquo;  But I have
downloaded Skype and Skype seems to be easy to use.  </p>

<p>What we are going to try to do is open up the room on
Paltalk and someone, like Michael has been doing, can relay the questions to me
on Skype and I would answer them.  I am waiting on some things.  Bill said that
he was going to send me a link so that I can control the volume, like turn
someone down or be able to cut them off.  There is some software for that.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I have been having
discussions with friends, especially with girlfriends on the phone that can
take hours.  We agree that on meditation, it is not voluntary; it just comes. 
After we become a child of God, the Lord commands that we meditate.  But from
our experiences, we just meditate.  We do not do this because we voluntarily
want to.  Last night, a thought just came to my mind about a verse that says
that Jesus also died for the world.  Then I thought that maybe this is why the
unsaved of the world would not have to suffer eternally.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The whole idea of eternal suffering is
just wrong.  It is not because this has been modified in any way or because
Christ did this or that and that would be why God changed it.  It just never
was the plan of God.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  We know that He died to give
us, the elect, life.  But outside of the elect, I thought that perhaps because
He suffered eternally, the world would have to do that if He had not made the
sacrifice.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  No.  If Christ died in any kind of redemptive
way for all men, then it is not that they would not die eternally, they would
not die at all.  They would live forever; and so we cannot make this kind of
claim.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I am saying that they do not
have to suffer eternally because of the sacrifice of Christ for them.  But the
double blessing is what the elect would get.  We do not have to suffer
eternally, but we also get life eternally.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  No.  You cannot do this.  There is one
judgment.  There is one wrath of God.  Christ experienced it.  What He
experienced, the unsaved must experience.  It would be meted out to them in the
same way.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Then that is why because of His
experience, the world would not have to experience eternal suffering.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  No.  I am sorry.  We are going to go to one
more person, and then we will take a break for lunch.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>13<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Zechariah, you were
talking about the rest.  What kind of rest did you have in view?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Well, it is not me.  That word &ldquo;rest&rdquo;
has to do with the cessation of war.  For the land of Canaan, the conquest was
complete; and then there was rest.  </p>

<p>It is the same word in the book of Judges when Eglon, who
had taken Israel captive in a sense, for 18 years.  This reminds us of the
woman in bondage for 18 years to Satan that Luke talks about.  When Eglon was
killed, the land had rest.  </p>

<p>When Sisera was killed in the book of Judges by Jael, the
land had rest.  Again, when Athaliah was killed, there was quiet or rest.  When
Jehoshaphat and his army came back from the spoil of that great victory, there
was rest in his days.  </p>

<p>So, again and again and again, it means that the war is
over, the battle is won, and now there is rest.  It does not mean it physically
on any kind of a level, because we, of course, are not going to see that in
this world.  </p>

<p><b>14<sup>th</sup> Question (<i>continued from Question #13</i>): 
</b>But, spiritually, does this mean that those who do not believe the same
things we believe are going to become tares, just like those in the churches?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not think that this particular
word in that verse is not talking about that.  It is talking about God&rsquo;s plan
and that He gained the victory.  Therefore, there is a period of spiritual rest
for His people, for His elect.  </p>

<p>Let me just say this, because somehow this has gotten
misrepresented.  This goes back to the studies that I was doing that were on
Family Radio.  By the way, those studies are on the EBible Fellowship website
and they are available in audio and in text format.  Yet someone is saying that
I said that anyone who did not agree that there is no more salvation is
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>Please prove this.  Please, go find the text or go find the
audio and, in some cases, go find the video and show this; because I never said
that.  I never said that.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 16, when we were talking about men being
scorched with fire, it said in Revelation 16:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name
of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>What I did say is that this is related to today because of
the spiritual climate that we are in and that God is trying us.  Then I said
that the word &ldquo;blaspheme&rdquo; is a word that is often translated as &ldquo;speak evil
of,&rdquo; and that it is the same word that is in the context of blaspheming the
Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>So just in trying to identify that word and what it means to
&ldquo;speak evil of,&rdquo; I brought up the verse about blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  But
I never said that anyone was blaspheming the Holy Spirit because they did not
agree with this doctrine or with that doctrine.  That is just not true.  </p>

<p>I was just using this as an opportunity because what you
said reminded me of this.  </p>

<p><b>Additional comments:  </b>Actually, Mr. Camping made an
apology.  Maybe that is what they are talking about.  He said this about
someone who did not believe that the world was ending on October 21, that they
were not saved.  I know that Mr. Camping apologized for something like that.<b>
</b></p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Mr. Camping did say this.  </p>

<p>A<b>dditional comments:  </b>Maybe that is what they thought
you were saying.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  No; I do not think so.  What I think Mr.
Camping said and what I heard him say prior to May 21 when people would ask,
&ldquo;If I do not believe this, am I saved or not?&rdquo;  He would just go to 1 Thessalonians
5 in that Christ is not coming for His people as &ldquo;a thief.&rdquo;  This is what he
would point out, and I see nothing wrong with that comment.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here and have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank You for Your help.  We
thank You that You are a helper and that You are our strength and shield and
all things that we need.  Father, we pray that You would help us today to
meditate upon You and Your Word and to think about You and about just the
glorious nature of Your Word and Your Kingdom.  May You help us to keep our
thoughts on things above and not on the things of the earth.  May You purge our
conscience from dead works and help us to think correctly.  We pray these
things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </i></p>
