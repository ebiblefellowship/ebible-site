  <p>Question Summary with Starting Times in Audio File</p>
  <ol>
  <li><span class="time">01:53</span> What can individuals do to get the message out about Purim?  Should we send money to eBible Fellowship to help with billboards?  On a personal note, it would be hard to share this with my family because I would be a laughingstock to them.    </li>
  <li><span class="time">05:20</span> I had two bumper stickers made up.  One says, &ldquo;Thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days (Daniel 12:13).&rdquo;  The other one states, &ldquo;Feast of Purim &ndash; March 7-9, 2012&rdquo; and then I highlighted the book of Esther.  </li>
  <li><span class="time">10:00</span> What is to be understood spiritually from Genesis 19:18-20 and Genesis 19:30 in relation to Lot fearing for his life to flee to the mountains as God had commanded him and had instead wanted to flee to Zoar; but then in Genesis 19:30, Lot was afraid to be in Zoar and fled from there to live in the mountains?  Incidentally, he did not ask God if he might go to the mountains; he just went.  Can you comment on this?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">19:30</span> Earlier today, someone asked a question about having a question mark at the end of the new date for the end of the world.  Can you elaborate on this again?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">24:39</span> When Purim begins on March 7th, what are we to expect?  Will this be a similar scenario to what we thought was going to happen on May 21st where there will be a rolling earthquake with a lot of physical damage occurring and so forth?  Can we expect to be raptured at some point during those three days of Purim?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">31:08</span> Does the time that Noah went into the ark and God shut the door until the moment that he exited the ark have any relevance to where we are right now?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">33:11</span> Can you please check Luke 12:37-39 and offer an explanation of these verses?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">38:43</span> In Deuteronomy 29:23-28 you mentioned during your study this morning regarding the captivity from Babylon, do these verses imply that we are to still try to spread the Gospel to the unsaved at this time?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">43:25</span> Do you have any additional insights regarding the two banquets of wine that were in Esther 5 and 7?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">47:20</span> In response to one of my questions last week, you said that we are not the ones judging the people in the churches but God is.  To be clear, could you define for me what you mean when you use the word &ldquo;church&rdquo;?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">54:21</span> Have you had time to look at Zechariah 11:8-13 and prayerfully been given a possible explanation for these verses?    </li>
  <li><span class="time">56:05</span> What does the &ldquo;third loft&rdquo; spiritually represent in Acts 20:9 where we read of a young man who had been asleep on the third loft and fell off?  </li>
  <li><span class="time">57:15</span> Can you read Joshua 8:28-29?  When we harmonize all of the information on Satan losing his authority on May 21 and the end of the world, could these verses also relate?  </li>
  </ol>
