<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Being that Christmas is
soon, I was wondering if the Bible says anything about Christmas being so
commercialized and that they do not have the true meaning of Christ&rsquo;s birth and
who Christ is.  People celebrate this in a commercial sense with Santa Claus.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Is there any day of the year when
people do what is right?  Is there any day of the year when people do what they
should do?  It is not only Christmas.  Yes, it is true that this is a day that
we have set aside to observe the birth of Christ and really to thank God and to
give glory to Him that He did, through Jesus, enter into the world.  But every
day, really, should be a day when we wake up and say, &ldquo;Today is a day that the
Lord has made and let us rejoice and be glad in it.  Let us serve Him.  Let us
do His will.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Does mankind ever do this?  Certain ones, only by God&rsquo;s
grace, are the ones who realize, &ldquo;Okay; today is God&rsquo;s day and I want to do His
will today.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the case with Christmas.  We cannot expect people
who are far from God and in darkness and who have no real understanding of the
Bible or of Christ to properly observe that day.  </p>

<p>So we can just be thankful if we hear a hymn or if we hear a
carol that is mentioning some truth from the Bible.  We can be thankful for
opportunities where maybe we can share something.  But there is no sense in
being upset because the world is using that day as a worldly day, like they do
every other day.  This is always going to be the case because we are never
going to convince the world to live as they should because they are part of the
world.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Matthew 2
where Herod was tricked by the magi?  They had to go another way.  The angel of
the Lord told them to go another way and to flee into Egypt because Herod was
going to seek the child to destroy him.  When Herod found out that he was
tricked, he had all the babies killed from two years old and under.  Did this
have something to do with Herod&rsquo;s jealousy or that he thought that the kingdom
was going to be taken away from him?  What are your thoughts on this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>In Matthew 2:11-12, this is speaking
of the wise men who came from the east.  It says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And when they were come into the house&hellip;  </p>

<p>They did not come into a stable; and so the Christmas cards
that you see with them going into the stable are incorrect. They went into the
house and then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they saw the young child with Mary his mother&hellip;  </p>

<p>They did not see a baby, because He was older at this
point.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened
their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and
myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod,
they departed into their own country another way.  </p>

<p>Herod realizes that he was deceived.  You are right.  He was
very jealous.  He loved power and the authority that he had.  He was a proud
man.  </p>

<p>It is amazing the depths that people can sink to in lust for
some sin, whatever the sin happens to be.  When sin takes hold of a person, we
can really see the depths of depravity.  There is not total depravity because
God has always instilled a conscience element into man to where man can still
feel guilty to a degree.  But there certainly are great depths of depravity
that people can sink down into.  </p>

<p>Mankind can go pretty far into the mire and into the mud,
and Herod went that way out of lust for power and authority.  He did not want
anyone to dare take his kingdom, even though he was an old man and was actually
going to die.  Historical sources tell us that he did die in 4 B.C.  Jesus was
born in 7 B.C.  By the time that the wise men got to Jesus, He was already a
toddler.  </p>

<p>So that was very close to the point when Herod would
actually physically die, and he was still doing evil things to seek to remain
in power and in control.  But what good did this do him?  What good did this do
him at all?  This did nothing for him.  And what misery did he cause others
when he slew all the children from two years and under in that certain area? 
Historically, he was an evil man; and history is full of them.  </p>

<p>But in the book of Revelation, God tells us what this was
all a picture of.  We read in Revelation 12:2-4 about a woman:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained
to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his
heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be
delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.  </p>

<p>This is what Herod pictured.  He pictured Satan who wanted
to kill Christ.  </p>

<p>So Satan stirred up this wicked king, Herod, to kill the
baby.  If he could do this, he would accomplish his master&rsquo;s wish, which was to
destroy the baby, the Lord Jesus Christ; and yet, underneath it all, it was
actually Satan working to kill the baby.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Revelation 12:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and <i>to </i>his
throne.  </p>

<p>So we know that it is definitely Christ who is in view here
in Revelation 12.  He was brought forth from a woman, which is how God pictures
the believers.  As Jesus came down the line in Israel, He was delivered into
history and then Satan wanted to kill him and to destroy him but God, of
course, spared Jesus and protected Him; and then later, Jesus was caught up. 
He was resurrected and then He went up forty days after.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Since this is the Christmas
holiday season, we have been singing Christmas songs, but there is this one
song that bothers me.  It refers to Christ as &ldquo;the son of Mary.&rdquo;  I know that
Jesus acknowledged Himself as the Son of God and as the Son of man, but it
seems that He did not acknowledge Himself as the son of Mary.  As a matter of
fact, He called her &ldquo;woman.&rdquo;  Can you say something about this?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The problem is that people say that
Mary is the mother of God.  That is a wrong statement.  That is not true,
because God is eternal.  Certainly, she did not begat God.  But in the sense
that God entered into the human race in a human form and in a physical body,
Mary was His mother.  She did give birth.  In that sense only, we can say that
Mary was the mother of Jesus.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I have a couple of women
friends.  I argue with them and they argue with me.  One is Catholic.  The
other was Catholic but became a Biblical Christian and a Family Radio
listener.  We were arguing about how God technically put Jesus in Mary&rsquo;s womb. 
I said that it was possible that she could have been a surrogate.  Maybe,
literally, God used that seed in her, but God did not tell us technically how
He did this.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Well, He was conceived by the Holy Spirit. 
The Bible tells us this.  How did He make Adam and Eve?  He just created them. 
Since then, there is a natural process between men and women, but that is why
it was a miraculous birth.  He was born of a virgin.  </p>

<p>It needed to be this way because He could not have had an
earthly father.  If Joseph were Jesus&rsquo; father, then He would not have been
sinless because you cannot bring a clean from an unclean.  We read this in the
book of Job, &ldquo;Who can bring a clean <i>thing </i>out of an unclean? not one.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Christ was eternal God and was without sin.  In order for
Him to be born without the taint of sin, He had to be born of God and without
an earthly Father.  But He also had to be born of a woman, but in this case a
virgin; and so God made it very clear that His birth had nothing to do with the
natural way in which children enter into the world.  This was a miraculous
birth.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  How about the biological make
up?  Could God have just put an embryo there or a body there?  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I do not think that we should get into that
area.  How ever He did it, we know that He was conceived.  He was an embryo and
went through all of the stages.  All of the stages that ever other child goes
through, Christ went through.  We just need to leave it there.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I wondered if God used the
biological part of Mary.  But then, it is not important.  Right?  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  We know that He was born with a body.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Someone from Paltalk offers
Matthew 1:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Would you please comment on
the message from Mr. Camping where he mentioned that Jesus is the light of the
world and that since nothing shows that this light has gone out, this
emphasizes that salvation has to still be possible?  With this being mentioned,
would this not mean that May 21, 2011 was not Judgment Day?   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It is not as simple as that.  We have
this statement from Mr. Camping that is written and on the Family Radio
website.  This is a relatively short statement.  In it, he mentions a couple of
verses that bring up all sorts of questions.  </p>

<p>Until these questions are answered, personally, I could
never hand out a tract right now.  I would be convicted by my conscience at
this point.  </p>

<p>Mr. Camping went to John 9:5.  It says in John 9:4-5:    </p>

<p class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world.  </p>

<p>Verse 4 indicates that there is a period of night.  When
does this night come?  We thought that we understood this.  </p>

<p>We also have to factor in Matthew 24:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  </p>

<p>Now we have a question to answer.  Certain circumstances
will not allow, as this is God&rsquo;s will, for Mr. Camping to be on the &ldquo;Open
Forum&rdquo; program to be asked these things at this time.  But was May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011 the great tribulation?  Did it end on May 21, 2011?  If so, immediately after, the sun was darkened and the moon did not give its light.  </p>

<p>How do you explain this?  This is not a simple thing.  This
is not something that can be quickly stated where, all of a sudden, we have an
answer.  There are a lot of other questions that come up that have to be
answered.  </p>

<p>What was that 23 years?  What was May 21, 2011?  Was it Judgment Day or was it not Judgment Day?  </p>

<p>Personally, I feel that May 21, 2011 was the last day of the great tribulation and that it was Judgment Day.  Therefore, verses like
Matthew 24:29 spiritually come into play in that the sun is darkened and the
moon is not giving its light, and so on.  Also on May 21, 2011, we have the additional confirmation that it was 7,000 years from the flood, the day that the
door was shut.  </p>

<p>I understand that we are in a period of time now where there
are a lot of questions and a lot of uneasiness, and yet I think that one
problem is that Mr. Camping is not aware of some information that is in the
book of Esther that I hope we can look at in the next few weeks.  This
information will reaffirm some things and also will give us a date for the end,
but I just do not want to lay this out right now.   </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I have two different
questions.  One is about Psalm 58:10.  There was some teaching in the last
couple of months that there may be a simultaneous resurrection or rapture of
the true believers with the nonbelievers passing on.  Through some research, it
was found that the unsaved may pass on in a blink of an eye.  In relation to
Psalm 58:10, could you explain the fact that we might see God&rsquo;s wrath on the
unbelievers?      </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>You are referring to the actual day
when Christ comes.  Let us read Psalm 58:10:    </p>

<p class="verse">The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Christ.    </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  The last part looks like
Christ.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  The first part does, too.  He is &ldquo;the
righteous.&rdquo;  Romans says, &ldquo;There is none righteous, no, not one,&rdquo; and so this
is not referring to any of us.  We have imputed righteousness, but He is The
Righteous One.  This is why it is singular: &ldquo;when he seeth the vengeance.&rdquo;  It
does not say: &ldquo;when they see the vengeance.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I have another question
that I brought up last week but did not quite get my point across.  If the Lord
does not come in 2011, which would be the end of this year, would God share His
glory in 2012 with the Mayan calendar?  They never worshipped Him.  They
worshipped another God.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I understand what you are saying, but
we have to remember that if Christ came at the Feast of Purim, let us say just
to pick one, in 2012, no one is going to be thinking about the Mayans when the
world is coming to an end.  They are going to realize that what is going on is
about God.  It has nothing to do with the Mayans, especially since their date
is several months off.  Wrong is wrong, whether it is one day or several
months, so I do not think that it enters into it.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  There has been so much in the
media trying to put down 2011, which was coming from the Bible, and trying to
ignore God and His plan concerning the coming of the end.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  You can almost tell when something is false
by the amount of media coverage it is prone to get and the playfulness with
which it is presented.  </p>

<p>In the case of May 21, the world was forced to finally
discuss the end in a very uncomfortable way.  But with the Mayan calendar,
whenever you hear reports, it is a joke.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  If He does not come in 2011, it
will look like we were wrong in the studies that we have from the Bible, when
other people at this time, because nothing happened on May 21 like we said, have
switched over in their thinking.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  We were wrong as far as the understanding of
what May 21 was and what October 21 was.  I would say that God not only allowed
it but wanted it to be this way.  </p>

<p>This is how we understand the verse in Habakkuk, &ldquo;Though [<i>he</i>]
tarry&hellip;[<i>he</i>] will not tarry.&rdquo;  This is because God allowed this
understanding of a certain date to appear as though He tarried; but in truth,
He has never tarried for a moment.  He has always had a set date that will be
the end.  </p>

<p>We have to remember that the first earth went 6,023 years. 
That is where we get the 23 from now, as we are in the year 13,023.  We get it
from the first earth and the tribulation period that was adjoined with that. 
But from the flood, we are in the year 7,000.  We are not in 7,023.  We are in
the year 7,000 all the way into the year 2012; but how God totals out the first
earth and the second earth is His business.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  If there is a space, like we
read in Revelation 11, where we would go up and these people would be suffering
at that point, God would be saying that He shares His glory with only a certain
group of people.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  When Christ comes, there will not be another
five months or anything like that.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I am just wondering if there is
a difference between when we are raptured and for those left behind.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I think that we will have a chance to talk
more about certain things later.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>What period of time is
Nehemiah 13:19 referring to?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Nehemiah is right before Esther.  We
read in Nehemiah 13:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and
charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and <i>some </i>of
my servants set I at the gates, <i>that </i>there should no burden be brought
in on the sabbath day.</p>

<p>I would rather not say and try to get into this, just
pulling out information that appears to fit.  We have to look at the whole
context of something.  </p>

<p>It is an easy error to make when you go to a verse and just
pull out little bits and pieces, but the context is important.  I would want to
go through this before discussing it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can we look at Malachi
4:5?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Malachi 4:5 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of JEHOVAH:  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  We are a picture of Elijah
because he got raptured up into Heaven.  I think they knew the time that he was
going to be raptured.  He either told them or the people knew.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Yes; they did know the day that he was going
up.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I figured that we are a picture
of Elijah.  He was a prophet also.  It says that &ldquo;before the coming of the
great and dreadful day&rdquo; that Elijah shall come.  The last prophecy was John the
Baptist.  After that, John got his head cut off.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  We know that Jesus identified John the
Baptist with Elijah or the spirit of Elijah.  I think that there probably is a
dual application to the time of the end.  </p>

<p>Earlier, a lot of people were identifying Mr. Camping as
Elijah.  Of course, he never accepted that.  Yet this could be related to the
believers and there could be a dual application.  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  I was thinking that this is
relating to how we are prophesying and how we are the last before &ldquo;the great
and dreadful day.&rdquo;  John the Baptist was the last prophet who prophesied of
Jesus&rsquo; coming.  We are now also prophesying of Jesus&rsquo; coming and I thought that
this was kind of neat.  I thought I&rsquo;d mention it if anybody would like to take a
look at this.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  Okay.  Thank you that verse.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at
Revelation 10:1-8 pertaining to there no longer being time?  Do you know
anything about that?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Let us look at Revelation 10:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that
therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should
be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished&hellip;    </p>

<p>By the way, the word &ldquo;begin&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;about,&rdquo; which is
found in Revelation 10:4 where it says &ldquo;I was about to write.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So when John saw the vision, he had pen in hand and he was
about to write, but he did not write.  This is the same word here where it
says, &ldquo;when he shall begin to sound.&rdquo;  So this was when he was &ldquo;about to
sound,&rdquo; but he had not sounded.  He was about to sound that &ldquo;the mystery of God
should be finished.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Revelation 10 continues to be a difficult chapter.  I think
that it is going to take more study.  I am not ready to say anything more about
it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>10<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>October 21 was the Feast
of Ingathering and Tabernacles.  With the teaching of Esther, are we at the
point in time when God is gathering in His elect and we are dwelling in
booths?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It is interesting that the Feast of
Ingathering does identify with the latter rain, which was 17 years; then it
came to an end.  The rain stopped falling, the door shut on May 21, and we had
a period of 153 days.  We read about 153 fish in John 21 and all of these fish
were caught in the net and were dragged to shore to Jesus, to where Jesus was. 
</p>

<p>So it appears that all of the elect were saved by May 21. 
Then the process of the 153 days began wherein all of the elect were being
brought unto the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles in order to be presented
in some sort of way before the Lord, because God emphasizes repeatedly that we
are not to appear before Him empty, that the fruits were to be gathered in
before we kept the feast.  </p>

<p>Obviously, the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was not
the last day of the end of the world; so we misunderstood this.  We were
incorrect as to the significance of the Feast of Tabernacles.  </p>

<p>That is the benefit of the book of Esther because it does
not deal with the Feast of Tabernacles.  It gives a direct time path from one
point to another.  </p>

<p>We are still trying to understand other information.  Why
the five months?  There is a five-month period laid out in the Bible.  Zechariah
1 helps to confirm this, and so that was not incorrect.  God, for His own
purposes, wanted to stress May 21 as Judgment Day and He also wanted an
emphasis on October 21.  </p>

<p>Also, this all helps to lay out the period of the &ldquo;fiery
trial&rdquo; in order for His people to be patient, as we see in James 1.  To define
&ldquo;patience,&rdquo; let us read this.  I never really noticed something before seeing
this recently.  We read in James 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Knowing <i>this, </i>that the trying of your faith worketh
patience.  </p>

<p>You must have patience &ldquo;after ye have done the will of God&rdquo;
to &ldquo;receive the promise.&rdquo;  You are in &ldquo;need of patience.&rdquo;  What works
patience?  It is the &ldquo;trial of your faith.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Are we in a period of trial of faith?  Certainly!  Have we
&ldquo;done the will of God&rdquo;?  Normally, we would question, &ldquo;What?  What kind of
question is this?  Every single day, we have the obligation to do the will of
God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is true in many ways; but we have to ask, &ldquo;What does
God mean when He said &lsquo;after ye have done the will of God&rsquo;&rdquo;?  It cannot be that
after we have done the will of God, we go right to Heaven.  If this were true,
we would have no &ldquo;need of patience.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So there has to be a period of time after you have done the
will of God until you go to Heaven wherein you have need of patience, which is
a period defined as the trying of faith.  This is where we are.  </p>

<p>Of course, when God, for His own purposes (and this is one
of them), proclaims a date and moves His people to share this with the world
and that date passes and it appears He has tarried, instantly, we can see,
especially at this period of time, the trying of all of His people&rsquo;s faith.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>11<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Nehemiah 9:3, it speaks
of &ldquo;the LORD their God&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fourth part,&rdquo; and then it repeats this.  Of
course, this is talking about the Hebrews.  Why does it say &ldquo;the LORD their
God&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;the Lord God.&rdquo;  Would that not be more appropriate?  Could
you help me with this?  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Let us read Nehemiah 9:3:    </p>

<p class="verse">And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
law of JEHOVAH their God <i>one </i>fourth part of the day; and <i>another </i>fourth
part they confessed, and worshipped JEHOVAH their God.  </p>

<p>So your question is why it says &ldquo;their God&rdquo; and not &ldquo;the
God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, the answer is that God is the God of all men.  He
created all men, but He has a special relationship with His people who are
typified by the Jews here.  The Jews were the people of God, the &ldquo;chosen ones&rdquo;
out of all of the earth, even though many of them were not saved.  God was
their God in a way that He was not the God of all of the rest of the people of
the world.  </p>

<p>It is the same thing today.  God is the God of the child of
God in a special way, because He does not have this relationship with just
anybody.  This is why it says &ldquo;Jehovah their God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b>12<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Does any part of this
study still stand?  There is a link to &ldquo;mielke.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I cannot comment on anybody else&rsquo;s
study.    </p>

<p><b>13<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Do we know or have any
inclination of what the feast is, as the young men do, in Judges 14:10?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Judges 14:10:    </p>

<p class="verse">So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
feast; for so used the young men to do.</p>

<p>No, I am sorry.  I cannot help you with that verse.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>

<p>Robert wants to make sure that everyone understands that
next week we begin at 10 A.M. (EST).  </p>

<p>Again, we will be here on Christmas.  The following week,
Lord willing, which is New Year&rsquo;s Day, hopefully we will be here.  </p>
