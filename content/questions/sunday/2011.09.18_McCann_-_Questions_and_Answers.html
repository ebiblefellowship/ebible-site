<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>I was wondering if you
could go over Isaiah 66:17-18?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Isaiah 66:17-19:    </p>

<p class="verse">They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one <i>tree </i>in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith JEHOVAH.  For I <i>know
</i>their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all
nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.  And I will set a
sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <i>to
</i>Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <i>to </i>Tubal, and Javan, <i>to
</i>the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;
and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles [<i>or among the nations</i>]. 
</p>

<p>I have not really gone through these verses.  We can get
some basic ideas, but I really do not know.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>In Matthew 7:22, it talks
about &ldquo;Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord.&rdquo;  Then Christ says in
Matthew 7:23, &ldquo;Depart from me.&rdquo;  When will this actually take place?  We
thought that this would take place on May 21<sup>st</sup>, but things did not
turn out this way.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>These are good verses and a good
question.  We read in Matthew 7:21-23:    </p>

<p class="verse">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.  </p>

<p>This is talking about the Day of Judgment beginning May 21. 
That is when this is beginning.  </p>

<p>We have to look at this from God&rsquo;s perspective and not from
our perspective.  We do not see people running around and saying, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo;
and we definitely do not see this response from God.  But from God&rsquo;s
perspective, He shut the door.  </p>

<p>Since that day, just as in previous history, people are
still trying to enter into the Kingdom of God.  This is basically those in the
churches, but it is not only those in the churches.  </p>

<p>We have learned that there are people who have been outside
of the churches who professed to be Christians and true believers but who are
not.  In a sense, they are going to God and saying, &ldquo;Lord, I have done this and
I have done that and, therefore, I deserve entry into the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; 
But Christ is saying, &ldquo;No. I never knew you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When we go to Matthew 25 with the parable of the ten virgins,
we find the time for when they say &ldquo;Lord, Lord.&rdquo;  It says in Matthew 25:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.  </p>

<p>This was the significance of May 21, which was the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of 2<sup>nd</sup> month in the Hebrew calendar and the equivalent date to
when God shut Noah into the ark.  </p>

<p>So the door shut and this is the day that the Bride became
ready; that is, God gathered all of the elect.  The whole Bride, the whole body
was complete.  He brought her in, in a sense, into His chambers.  </p>

<p>Remember, we read this in Isaiah 26:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers&hellip;  </p>

<p>Song of Solomon 1:4 says, &ldquo;The king hath brought me into his
chambers.&rdquo;  This is speaking of the relationship between Christ and His
Church.  </p>

<p>So the King, eternal God, has brought His Bride into His
chambers, as we read again in Isaiah 26:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
doors about thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what happened with the five virgins.  He brought
them in.  The door was shut.  </p>

<p>This is plural here, because this is also looking at this
from the perspective that there are tens of millions whom God saved who are on
the earth right now, the great multitude.  In that sense, to us, this is
plural; but to God, of course, this is all one body, one door.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little
moment, until the indignation be overpast.  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  What does He mean by, &ldquo;Come, my
people, enter into your chambers, and hide yourself&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>I remember reading Zephaniah a bunch of times as we were
leading up to May 21.  In Zephaniah 2:1-3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
desired; Before the decree bring forth, <i>before </i>the day pass as the
chaff, before the fierce anger of JEHOVAH come upon you, before the day of
JEHOVAH'S anger come upon you. Seek ye JEHOVAH, all ye meek of the earth, which
have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
shall be hid in the day of JEHOVAH'S anger.  </p>

<p>That &ldquo;day&rdquo; is five months.  It is from May 21 to October
21.  </p>

<p>So God is really saying, &ldquo;Seek Me.&rdquo;  But, of course, only
His elect would.  Then you would experience salvation if you were one of His
elect.  This would hide you.  </p>

<p>Turn to Colossians 3.  We read in Colossians 3:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. </p>

<p>You are dead and your life is hid.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Christ, <i>who is </i>our life, shall appear, then shall ye
also appear with him in glory.  </p>

<p>So we are dead in Him and we are hid.  Our life is hid in
Him.  This is what God had in mind when He said that you might be hid in the
day of His anger.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Isaiah 26 that we are to enter into our
chambers, shut the door and hide ourselves &ldquo;for a little moment,&rdquo; just a little
moment, &ldquo;until the indignation be overpast.&rdquo;  And this word &ldquo;indignation&rdquo; is a
word that means &ldquo;anger&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrath.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>This is the &ldquo;day of the LORD&rsquo;S anger&rdquo; and we are hid in Him,
even though we are exposed.  We are walking around like anybody else in plain
sight; but, spiritually, we are all hid in the chamber, which is like the
marriage chamber.  The bed is in the chamber and it is like God took His Bride
in, provided safety and protection for her, and then He is saying that He now
has to go and take care of His enemies.  </p>

<p>This might explain what we read in Luke where it says, &ldquo;when
he will return from the wedding,&rdquo; because this is the marriage supper of the
Lamb, which is really when the fowls come to feast on the enemies of God.  This
is what is going on presently.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Isaiah 26:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">For, behold, JEHOVAH cometh out of his place to punish the
inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her
blood, and shall no more cover her slain.  </p>

<p>Here God is indicating that, on one hand, He is gathering
His people, He is hiding them for a small moment, and now He is turning His
attention to the world to punish the world because it is Judgment Day.  Yet
this does not seem to make sense with the traditional idea that God takes His
people out of the world, they are all in Heaven, and then He judges the world
all in a moment of time.  But, no.  This is a five-month process.  </p>

<p>Going back to the parable of the ten virgins, we read again
in Matthew 25:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and
the door was shut.  </p>

<p>I just want to remind us that this is definitely the door to
Heaven.  This is the only way in, but this is also called the &ldquo;door into the
sheepfold.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know this because of what we read in John 10 where Jesus
identifies Himself as &ldquo;the door.&rdquo;  Where it says that He is &ldquo;the door,&rdquo; it says
the &ldquo;door into the sheepfold&rdquo; and the &ldquo;door of the sheep.&rdquo;  The whole context
of John 10 is that He is the shepherd of the sheep.  He is the door.  </p>

<p>God searched for all of His lost sheep throughout history. 
He found them all, He brought them all in safely into the sheepfold, and then He
shut the door to the sheepfold.  </p>

<p>If anyone is still insisting that the door is still open for
salvation, well, they are basically trying to go up some other way.  John 10
tells us that they are a thief and a robber if they do this.  Once the door of
the sheep is closed, it is because all of the sheep have been found.  Now it is
time to feed sheep and that is what is going on.  </p>

<p>Let us read Matthew 25:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.  </p>

<p>So this connects this statement, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; to the
shutting of the door.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you go over Luke
21:25-28 again?   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Luke 21:25:     </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the
waves roaring;  </p>

<p>There are signs in the sun, moon, and stars.  What are the
signs?  </p>

<p>The most evangelistic ministry that the world has ever seen
is saying that they are not going to be sending out the Gospel in order that
people become saved anymore and that they are not going to be printing tracts
or booklets, which they did abundantly for years and years.  </p>

<p>How many people have called up or sent an email in times
past to Family Radio indicating that they needed a certain number of tracts? 
Did they have any problem getting these tracts?  There might have been a
problem in the length of time that the tracts may have gotten to them, but they
always received them.  They were always free and cost was never a concern.  </p>

<p>More than this, they are a ministry that God raised up where
the teaching was translated into many, many languages.  I do not know how many
languages they ended up translating into, maybe 65, 70, or 75, but the Gospel
that was translated into all of these languages proclaimed day and night to all
the world that Judgment Day was coming, which is like we read in Zephaniah
where we were told to seek the Lord before the day come, before this Day of
Judgment come, that we might be hid before God&rsquo;s anger come.  </p>

<p>Now, this has stopped.  The print press at Family Radio is
pretty much quiet.  The Gospel that is going out is heard mostly in music, it
is heard in Bible reading, but we do not hear anyone urging us to go to God in
prayer and to cry out to Him today.  If we do hear something like this, that is
a mistake.  It is maybe an old recording and it should not be there.  </p>

<p>The true believers, those who have been following the Bible
and desirous to obey the Bible, they also have stopped.  Just look at your own
self and your own life over the last couple of years and how often you would go
out.  You felt a burden to go out if you stayed home.  You had this
information, you had the tracts, you had the time, and if you did not do this,
you had a conscience about this.  </p>

<p>I remember what I would think if I did not give a girl a
tract at the checkout.  I would have a bad conscience about this.  Sometimes I
would not remember to bring a tract into the store with me, and so I would have
to walk back to the car.  </p>

<p>Al of this is gone.  All of this is gone and we have no
conscience about not doing this.  Not to mention how we prayed.  We would pray for
God to have mercy on our family, on this one, on that one, that He might save
them.  Still, we are praying.  We are still praying, but we know that this is
done.  We know that whatever condition people are in, they are going to stay
this way.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the sun, moon, and stars spiritually are the lights
of the Gospel.  Christ is the sun.  The moon is the Word of God.  The stars are
the believers, the true believers.  Notice that Luke 21:25 does not say &ldquo;wandering stars.&rdquo;  These are the true believers.  </p>

<p>Why would God speak of the sun, which definitely represents
Christ, and the moon, which definitely represents His Word, and then refer to
those in the churches as the stars who are falling?  This does not fit with the
darkening of the true Gospel.  It is the believers who carry the true Gospel.  They
are all the ones who are affected by this.  They are the light of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>This is like it says in Revelation 18 when it is time for Babylon&rsquo;s
fall, when it is the time that God is judging them because the hour of judgment
has come.  It says in Revelation 18:21-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
cast <i>it </i>into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon
be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers,
and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters&hellip;    </p>

<p>If you look up these musical instruments, they have to do
with prophesying.  1 Chronicles 25:3 tells us that they &ldquo;prophesied with a
harp.&rdquo;  To prophesy means to declare the Word of God.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of
whatsoever craft <i>he be, </i>shall be found any more in thee; and the sound
of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; And the light of a candle
shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is Christ.  John the Baptist said, &ldquo;Behold, the
bridegroom cometh,&rdquo; and he was pointing to Jesus.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and of the bride&hellip;</p>

<p>The Bride would be the believers.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;shall be heard no more at all in thee&hellip;    </p>

<p>We read this and we thought that this would be because we
would not be here; but, no.  It does not require this.  </p>

<p>When God removed the Gospel from the church, did He remove
the believers from the world?  The churches still had Bibles and they still had
all of the trappings, but there was a famine of hearing in the church.  </p>

<p>The Bible says that &ldquo;faith <i>cometh </i>by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God,&rdquo; which means that they could not hear.  This is because
it takes the Holy Spirit to open up the ears.  </p>

<p>What God has done now in all of the world is that He has
brought a famine of hearing the voice of the Bridegroom and the voice of the
Bride.  This means that they cannot hear.  </p>

<p>When Family Radio broadcasts pure Bible reading, anyone who
is not saved will not hear it in the sense that the Holy Spirit can open their
ears that they become saved.  This is impossible at this point.  It cannot be
heard anymore at all, unless God has already opened up the ears of individuals
prior to May 21.  This means, of course, that they already have spiritual ears
and that they can hear spiritual truth.  </p>

<p>This is what is going on now and this is what Luke 21 is
talking about.  Notice that it says that this is for &ldquo;signs in the sun, and in
the moon, and in the stars.&rdquo;  This helps us to understand the parallel
passages, like in Matthew 24, that this is not literal.  It is not literally
the sun darkening or the moon turning to blood or the stars literally falling. 
It is a sign.  </p>

<p>Therefore, when we see the Gospel not going into the world,
which is what we are seeing, this is a sign to every one of us, like it says in
Luke 21:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.  </p>

<p>In other words, we are right on track.  We can know that we
are understanding this correctly.  We are within these fives months and, soon,
the redemption of our bodies will be here when Christ returns.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Can you explain the two
witnesses being slain in Revelation 11?  More people are teaching that the two
witnesses were killed on May 21, 1988 <span class="underline">and</span> May 21, 2011.   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It says in Revelation 11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall
overcome them, and kill them.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The beast&rdquo; is Satan who was bound for &ldquo;a thousand years,&rdquo;
which we read about in Revelation 20, and he is loosed.  He is loosed and the
first thing that he does is that he goes against the believers.  He goes
against the two witnesses and he is victorious.  This is the big thing.  He was
victorious May 21, 1988 because that is when God turned over the church and was
using Satan to destroy the church and to bring judgment at the house of God.  </p>

<p>First of all, when people say that we are dead in the eyes
of the world, when were we ever alive in the eyes of the world?  When were we
anything but the offscouring of the earth to them?  It is not the world who kills
us spiritually.  It is not that.  </p>

<p>What happened during the great tribulation is that God had
His people driven out of the churches and congregations.  We were killed in
that way.  But on May 21, 2011, that was not the day that God&rsquo;s people were
killed.  That was the day that God&rsquo;s people were delivered.  That was the day
of victory from sin and Satan.  </p>

<p>When people have it in their minds that Satan slew us on May 21, 2011, then who won?  Did God win?  Satan would be the winner if he slew us.  If he
killed us, then he has kept his kingdom and he is still on his throne.  But
this is not the case.  This is not the case at all.  </p>

<p>God gives us very definite information in many places.  At
the end of 70 years, the king of Babylon was slain, his kingdom was taken, and
then Cyrus, whom God calls His shepherd, took the kingdom.  This is what is
happening now.  </p>

<p>So this is a mistake that we do not want to make.  Forget
this idea.  Get out of your mind that we were killed on May 21, 2011.  This is not possible.  This is only in the sense that all through the great
tribulation God&rsquo;s people were killed like it says in John 16 when they were
driven out of the synagogue.  This is how we were spiritually killed.  </p>

<p>The world cannot kill us spiritually.  The world can kill us
physically.  They can kill our bodies, but they cannot kill us spiritually. 
How could they do this?  This is an impossibility.  </p>

<p>Thank you for that question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>I have a statement and a
question.  I really do not have a problem telling people who inquire about what
is going on with the Bible and what is going on about May 21<sup>st</sup>.  I
pray that the Lord humbles me when I talk to them about how salvation has
actually stopped.  I tell them that if they were not delivered before May 21<sup>st</sup>,
there is not anything that I can tell them.  Maybe the Lord will open my eyes
to other Scriptures, but there is nothing that I can give them.  I really
cannot stop talking about the Bible.  This is in all of my conversations.  But
when we look at the account of Stephen in Acts 7:52-54 where we read that they
&ldquo;gnashed on him with <i>their </i>teeth,&rdquo; it also says that they were &ldquo;cut to
the heart.&rdquo;  Then when we go to Matthew 24:48, this talks about the evil
servant who says that the Lord will delay His coming.  Then in Matthew 24:51,
it says that He shall &ldquo;cut him asunder, and appoint <i>him </i>his portion with
the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;  In what the
believers are telling people now, are we cutting them to the heart and are they
gnashing upon us with their teeth at this point in time since there is no hope
now for anyone who remained in the church?   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes.  This information is primarily
what God is using to judge the world.  He is using to judge the church and the
world that there is no more salvation.  </p>

<p>We are well into these five months.  The church, as far as I
have noticed, has not been a problem.  I have not seen the church really
harassing us at all.  They have been very quiet.  The problem has been from
within those who believed May 21.  </p>

<p>I think that one of the reasons is that, spiritually, God
likens the church to the firstborn.  When we look at the deliverance from Egypt,
at midnight God brought the plague of death of the firstborn of Pharaoh and the
Egyptians.  This just shook them and this was the big thing that prompted
Pharaoh to release all of the Israelite slaves, and so they were set free.  But
all of the firstborn were killed.  </p>

<p>This is just like at midnight or at the very beginning of
Judgment Day on May 21 when the third part of men were slain in all of the
churches and congregations spiritually.  They lost all hope right away because
they were in the church and in a situation where there was no salvation prior
to May 21.  Then in that transition, this killed them all.  For them, there is
just absolutely no hope.  On the other hand, there is, from our perspective,
hope for anyone outside of the church.  </p>

<p>I think that when we are in discussions now with people who
are pursuing and coming after the people of God, it has primarily been those
who were with us previous to May 21.  And we have to remember that we had it in
our minds that we were all brothers and sisters, but this is not the case
unless we are all truly saved.  It has always been this way throughout
history.  Even with the disciples, there was Judas.  </p>

<p>If Christ would have come as we had expected, some of these
people would have been left behind.  Since He did not come that way and this is
playing out over five months, they are falling away or going back to the world
or to the church or they are just being against the Gospel itself.  This is an
evidence that they were not saved and never were.  </p>

<p>As far as the &ldquo;weeping and gnashing of teeth,&rdquo; I do not know
how to fully explain exactly how this is taking place right now, but this would
tie in with this period of time.  I just cannot get into any detail about
this.  But thank you.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.   </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
