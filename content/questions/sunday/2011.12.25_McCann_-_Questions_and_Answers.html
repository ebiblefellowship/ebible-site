<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>I was watching a show on
the television that gave the names of the three kings who came to see the baby
Jesus.  Do we know the names of these three kings?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>The Bible does not give us their
names.  Any names that were used could be tradition or something that has been
handed down through the centuries, but we have no idea of knowing and so I
would not pay any attention to it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>I remembered that they cast
lots for Jesus&rsquo; garment.  Does this mean that Jesus is ultimately the
inheritance that we try to cast lots on?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>That is a good question.  Yes.  They
had His one piece of clothing that they did not want to rend.  It was more
valuable to be kept intact, and so they cast lots to receive it.  One of the
Roman soldiers received the covering of Christ.  This is how we can look at
that.  So it does point to someone who does become saved and then they are
clothed with Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.     </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Concerning election, could
we say that election was God&rsquo;s determination before the foundation of the
world, that it was His determination rather than His decision because He did
not have to choose?  I am more comfortable saying that it was His determination
rather than saying that it was His decision.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>As far as Christ is concerned, it says
in Acts 4:28:    </p>

<p class="verse">For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before
to be done.</p>

<p>This is referring to Jesus being turned over into the hands
of the Romans and being crucified.  It was God&rsquo;s &ldquo;determinate counsel.&rdquo;  This
is saying the same thing.  It was His will and His determination.    </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Esther 5:6 and in Esther
7:2, is the first day of the banquet of wine a picture of May 21 and the second
day a picture of October 21?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No.  I do not want to get into this
too much, but you are on the right track.  If you have time, take a look at the
dating of Esther 3 when the decree is given on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month and Haman&rsquo;s death.  God will link it to May 21 and not October 21. 
October 21 is not in view.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Joshua 11:20, it talks
about how the enemies of the Jews should be destroyed utterly.  I cannot
remember where this is, but if I remember right, one of the things that the
nation of Israel did not do correctly was to cast out all of the heathen.  I
wanted to link this in contrast to Esther because I think that Esther 8:11 is the verse that you were looking for.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes, that is the verse.   We read in
Esther 8:11:    </p>

<p class="verse">Wherein the king granted the Jews which <i>were </i>in every
city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to
slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, <i>both </i>little ones and women, and <i>to take </i>the
spoil of them for a prey,  </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  So what we are looking at is
&ldquo;destroy them utterly&rdquo; that we find in Joshua 11:20.  Are we on track with
saying that the fact that in Joshua&rsquo;s day they did not destroy utterly was an
open door for sin to continue?  This is kind of like the ark where there were
clean and unclean animals that came off and sin would continue; but in Esther,
this is not going to happen because it says to &ldquo;destroy them utterly.&rdquo;  I think
that this will be an indicator.  </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I think that this is a good point.  We do
know that God allowed some of the people of the land to remain.  It was the
Jew&rsquo;s responsibility, but God, of course, is in control of all circumstances and
He allowed this.  </p>

<p>He tells us why in the book of Judges and it was that God &ldquo;may
prove Israel&rdquo; or to try them; and this was a trial for the Israelites when they
would see these foreign nations so close to their own lands, sometimes living
in the same lot, and their idols and all of the things that Israel would later
seek after.  And so they failed the test.  </p>

<p>But the overall picture, and God has many pictures, but when
He says to slay utterly all of the inhabitants, that is one picture. 
Historically, we know that there were some left in the land.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Revelation 10 when it
says, &ldquo;Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them
not,&rdquo; could this relate to Esther and how the name of God is not mentioned at
all in Esther?  This is just a suggestion.   </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>I do not know.  I have never tied that
together or thought about that.    </p>

<p><b>Additional Comments:</b>  Could you at another time?    </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>  I will think about this.  It is really
unusual that Esther is a book without mentioning God or Jehovah in the Bible. 
This is not a secular historical record.  This is a Bible record of history and
God does not even record His own name.  I am not exactly sure why He did this,
but we can certainly see the hand of God in Esther as we read it.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please explain Matthew
24:44.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Matthew 24:44:    </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
the Son of man cometh.  </p>

<p>I know one thing, which is that this is not telling us that
we cannot know the time or that we should not look for the time.  </p>

<p>This would be a good hour for the Son of Man to come.  Would
this not be true after May 21 has passed and after October 21 has passed?  God
has set up a perfect and severe test for all of us.  </p>

<p>We mentioned that the &ldquo;trying of your faith worketh
patience&rdquo; in the book of James.  Let me show something else.  Maybe we can
discuss this in more detail another time.  Let us go back to Esther 8:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province <i>was </i>published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.  </p>

<p>They are to avenge themselves.  Maria said to me, &ldquo;What does
God mean by that?&rdquo;  How can we be in view in the same way as those Jews when
they killed their enemies?  </p>

<p>This is what happened historically.  In Shushan and in all
of the provinces, the Jews killed all of those who were going to kill them; and
here the law or the commandment is that the Jews should be ready against that
day, because it has been turned and they were to avenge themselves.  </p>

<p>Compare this to Luke 18 in the parable of the widow woman
whom God encourages not to faint.  We read in Luke 18:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint;  </p>

<p>Has anybody felt like fainting recently, spiritually?  You
do not have to raise your hand.  I could raise two, but I think that God&rsquo;s
people all over the world have felt this.  It is not a light thing that has
been going on.  </p>

<p>It continues on as God is encouraging us to pray, to keep
praying, and to not faint; and then says in Luke 18:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto
him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.  </p>

<p>The widow typifies the elect.  This is like the Jews in the
book of Esther where there is a law given that they may now avenge themselves
of their enemies.  Remember that Esther said of Haman, &ldquo;The adversary and enemy
<i>is </i>this wicked Haman,&rdquo; but so were the people who were following Haman
and so are Satan and all of his emissaries; and here is this parable and it is
interesting that the widow woman, who typifies the elect, is saying, &ldquo;Avenge me
of mine adversary.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you ever pray that way?  Do you ever pray like that?  For
a child of God who is told to forgive and to forbear, to say &ldquo;Avenge me&rdquo; sounds
pretty brutal, does it not?  But when do we pray this way?  When is it lawful
to pray this way?  It is when we pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, come quickly and come
soon.&rdquo;  This is because what is God going to do when He comes?  He is going to
take vengeance on all of the emissaries and adversaries of Himself and His
people.  </p>

<p>So we can understand that this is actually a prayer, and
this prayer fits this time.  This parable fits right now.  We will see why this
is so even more as we go on.  </p>

<p>It then says in Luke 18:4-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow
troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And
the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his
own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?  </p>

<p>So God is hearing now &ldquo;day and night,&rdquo; because this is a
reference to time.  We are still on the earth, there are still 24-hour days,
and God&rsquo;s people are crying out, &ldquo;What happened, O Lord?  How long, O Lord? 
Come quickly, O Lord!&rdquo;  In this sense, we are praying, &ldquo;Avenge me&rdquo;; and God is
saying, &ldquo;Keep coming; keep coming; do not give up; keep praying; do not faint;
do not stop coming to Me; believe the Bible; trust the Bible.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Did you believe the Bible?  Did you trust the Bible?  Is
there any shame in that?  No.  Let them be ashamed who transgress without cause
and who believe the things of this world, those who believe the things of the
churches, those who believe all of those things.  Let them be ashamed.  But for
anyone who believed the Bible, there is nothing to be ashamed about.  There is
nothing at all.  </p>

<p>We trusted the Word of God and the Word of God is still
right there and we cannot find fault.  I would say that I was wrong and that I
was sorry if we found a mistake, but there is no mistake to be found, except
that it did not happen precisely as we thought it would.  </p>

<p>The calendar of history comes from the Bible.  It is
intact.  It locked in May 21.  It is still something that is faithful, and I do
not know what else we can say about it, except that now we wait.  </p>

<p>It says in Luke 18:7 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with them?  </p>

<p>He most definitely is bearing long with us.  We are not perfect. 
We can very often sound like Israel in the wilderness murmuring and
complaining, crying like a little baby because things did not work out in the
way that we wanted them to and things are tough for us.  He is bearing with us,
believe me, and He is doing this long-sufferingly and patiently.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 18:8:   </p>

<p class="verse">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily&hellip;    </p>

<p>This means that God will come, &ldquo;Though I tarry, I will not
tarry.&rdquo;  He will come according to His Word, according to the set time, the
appointed time.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless&hellip;.  </p>

<p>This is included with that parable.  Listen to this
statement:   </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on
the earth?  </p>

<p>Did you hear that?  Do you see how He is joining this to
Esther?  &ldquo;Avenge me.&rdquo;  Here is the elect woman crying out, &ldquo;Avenge me, O
Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God in essence is saying, &ldquo;Okay; I hear you.  I am putting
up with you.  I will avenge you because you are My elect.  But when I come,
will you be found faithful,&rdquo; because this is a trial of faith.  This is a fiery
trial of faith and this is the hottest trial that we have ever experienced.  </p>

<p>Some have gone left and some have gone right, and some have
gone every which way; but will the Son of Man find faith on the earth?  Of
course, He will find the faith of Christ in His people, because He has given
them that faith; and I think that this is what answers that question.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Please explain Matthew
2:18.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Matthew 2:18:    </p>

<p class="verse">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
great mourning, Rachel weeping <i>for </i>her children, and would not be
comforted, because they are not.  </p>

<p>Historically, we understand that Herod had just slain the
children two years and under in Bethlehem and in the coast.  That would be an
area that would identify with Rachel, Jacob&rsquo;s wife.  I think that she was
buried around there, and so this is why there is this reference to her.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, I have heard Mr. Camping go over this, but it
has been awhile.  I have not studied this myself, so I cannot tell you exactly
what this means.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>9<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>In Esther 9:10,15-16, what is God referring to when He says, &ldquo;But they laid not their hands on the prey&rdquo;?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is getting pretty far along in
the book of Esther and we are not there yet, but I think it would relate to
when God destroys the world and destroys all of the enemies of His people.  </p>

<p>We are not going to take anything from this world.  We are
not going to take the riches of the world.  We are going to receive a new
heaven and a new earth.  I think it would relate to that.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
