<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>During the earlier January
1<sup>st</sup> question and answer session, you asserted that people who stayed
in the churches through May 21<sup>st</sup> were not part of the Bride of Christ. 
In the evening question and answer session, you said that we are not to judge as
to whether or not people are saved; and yet it seems like we are judging based
on our understanding of May 21<sup>st</sup>.  What are your thoughts on this? 
Was staying in the churches unforgivable?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>All we can say is that God brought
judgment on the churches, judgment began at the house of God, and He warned
people repeatedly to get out of the churches while they could.  Then what
happened on May 21<sup>st</sup> was that He closed the door to salvation on the
world.  </p>

<p>So now the great and un-repairable thing is that someone who
was in the church was in a spiritual condition to where they could not become
saved while they were in that church.  This is just the fact of the judgment that
was on the congregations.  The Holy Spirit had left and no one could become
saved who was under the hearing of the Gospel within any church in the world.  </p>

<p>This is why they were encouraged to leave.  But if they
stayed, when judgment came on the world &ndash; and the judgment that was on the
churches has now expanded to all of the world because the door to Heaven shut
to all of the world at that point &ndash; it is not me or the believer who is making
the judgment, it is God.  He is the One who brought the judgment on the church
and He is the One who brought judgment on the world on May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>All that we can do is to say, &ldquo;I am sorry, but you were in a
situation where there was no salvation and now there is no salvation in the
world.&rdquo;  But this is not judging any individual.  This is not pointing our
finger at someone, which we are not to do.  We are not to judge any man.  We
are just saying what the Bible teaches.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>In the book of Esther, you
were talking about Haman and his ten sons.  You said that Haman is a type of
Satan.  Would you say that his ten sons were a picture of the fallen angels who
fell with Satan?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No; the ten sons are actually a figure
of what we read in Revelation 13 and also in Daniel 7.  It says in Revelation
13:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Satan.  At the beginning of the great
tribulation, he is the beast and the beast has ten horns.  </p>

<p>So in the book of Esther, Haman (who is Satan) has ten sons,
and the interesting thing is that Haman is killed on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month; but the book of Esther does not end there.  It goes
all the way to Purim, which was in the 12<sup>th</sup> month, almost 10 months
later.  </p>

<p>This helps us to understand what Daniel 7 is saying.  In
Daniel 7, we also read about ten horns when the Ancient of days is sitting in
judgment.  But it says in Daniel 7:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Judgment Day, which was May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>So let us see what happened.  We read in Daniel 7:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake: I beheld <i>even </i>till the beast was slain&hellip;     </p>

<p>This is referring to the beast who came out of the sea. 
Satan was slain on Judgment Day, May 21, 2011, just like Haman was killed on
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>This should have been the very end of the world, right?  It
was Judgment Day and the beast was slain, and so that should have been it
according to what people have thought and what some are going back to.  They
say, &ldquo;On the very last day is when Satan will be destroyed.&rdquo;  But it continues
on:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to
the burning flame.  As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their
dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.  </p>

<p>How does this make sense?  It is Judgment Day.  The Ancient
of days is sitting on the throne, the beast is destroyed, and yet it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">As concerning the rest of the beasts&hellip;their lives were prolonged
for a season and time.  </p>

<p>We would have no way of understanding this, but then what we
have in Esther is actually an historical illustration of this.  Haman (or
Satan) is killed on the 17<sup>th</sup> day, but his ten sons were not killed until
Adar 13.  Then they were killed a second time by hanging on Adar 14.  So we
have the beast slain, but the lives of the rest of the beats are prolonged &ldquo;for
a season and time.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>To take this blueprint and lay it over what happened, we
have May 21, 2011, which was Judgment Day when Satan was put down from ruling
in the churches.  Then we have another date.  We have March 2012 when the Feast
of Purim comes and when the ten sons or horns of Satan will be destroyed.  </p>

<p>Satan is the beast and Satan is the horns.  This is just
language that is all referring to him, but they are referring to different
aspects of him.  He lost authority on May 21, 2011, but he will cease to exist
&ldquo;at the end of the days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>Can you turn to Psalm
37:1-9?  It speaks of &ldquo;evildoers&rdquo; and &ldquo;workers of iniquity&rdquo; and says that they
&ldquo;shall soon be cut down like the grass.&rdquo;  Does this have something to do with
the judgment to come and will God punish the wicked?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Here God is indicating in Psalm 37:9: 
  </p>

<p class="verse">For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon
JEHOVAH, they shall inherit the earth.  </p>

<p>This is the promise that God has given to His people who
wait upon Him.  The earth that is in view is the new earth, and that will be
eternity; but the evildoers would be all of the unsaved people.  There finally
comes a point when they are cut off and they cease to live, but God&rsquo;s people will
live forever.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Is Galatians 4:10 in any
way disproving calendar watching?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>No.  We read in Galatians 4:10:    </p>

<p class="verse">Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</p>

<p>This is referring to those who would go to the feast days or
perhaps the seventh-day Sabbath.  All of these fell on particular days, months,
and years, and yet their observance is that they want to continue to keep them
as they have been laid out in the Law of Moses.  </p>

<p>Of course, Christ fulfilled them, and so there is no
obligation.  Actually, for instance, God&rsquo;s people should not keep the Feast of
Purim.  We should not keep Purim in the sense that the Jews keep Purim.  We
should not keep the Passover in the sense that the Jews observe the Passover.  </p>

<p>We can look at those dates and we can learn from them and we
can see that God, spiritually, perhaps fulfilled them, as we were looking at
the Feast of Tabernacles; but we do not observe the Feast of Tabernacles.  We
did not literally go and live in booths.  </p>

<p>This verse has nothing to do with learning from the Bible
about a particular day of the coming of Christ.  Some people are just trying to
find something or anything, because they do not want to hear about this
anymore.  </p>

<p>This is any individual&rsquo;s privilege.  No one has to listen to
this anymore; but I think that before they go away, they want to have in their
own minds some justification for leaving behind these kinds of ideas.  </p>

<p>Well, they are not going to find this from the Bible.  They
can say that they do not want anything to do with this, but they cannot say
that God does not allow His people to search for His coming.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>There seems to be a
contradiction between 2<sup>nd</sup> Peter and Galatians 4 in relation to the
word &ldquo;elements.&rdquo;  If there is not a contradiction, please explain.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>It says in Galatians 4:9:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements&hellip;   </p>

<p>I would not want to comment on this without looking at the
Greek words.  I sort of remember looking up the word &ldquo;elements&rdquo; and seeing that
it could be different Greek words, so I would not try to compare them at this
time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Do you remember the passage
where Christ tells His disciples that a man that was born blind was for the
glory of God?  Now that we understand that God set up the entire creation for
His own purpose, is it okay to look at Satan as being used for the glory of
God?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Yes; God actually says this in Romans
where He is referring to Pharaoh who was a picture of Satan.  He says of
Pharaoh in Romans 9:17:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name
might be declared throughout all the earth.  </p>

<p>So He raised up Pharaoh in order to finally defeat him and
to destroy him in the Red Sea, and that did bring glory to God.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>7<sup>th</sup> Question &ndash; </b><b>Chris:  </b>Actually, I
remember a question that someone had on Facebook in the EBible Fellowship group
that I just wanted to comment on.  This person wrote about Adar 3.  The temple
was completed on Adar 3, which was 10 days away from Adar 13.  </p>

<p>The question was whether or not God would take His people
out earlier than the 13<sup>th</sup> or the 14<sup>th</sup> or the 15<sup>th</sup>
when the Feast of Purim comes, but I do not think so.  </p>

<p>This is like we were saying before.  It is kind of a clich&eacute;,
but it is true.  Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.  It does
not count when studying the Bible.  We have to be exact.  </p>

<p>It is very interesting that it was only 10 days away, but we
would have to find some link, some connection, maybe some ten-day reference in
relation to the completion of the temple that could tie it in to the 13<sup>th</sup>
day.  Until we do, there is no connection.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>8<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>If the doorkeepers are at
the door, which is Christ, when does the spiritual meaning of this become the
literal rapture?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>That is a different aspect of things. 
When God speaks of the door to Heaven and that Christ is the door, He has the
idea of salvation when we enter in, but we are already in.  </p>

<p>Where are we if we are a child of God?  We are seated in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus.  This is being in the Kingdom.  This is how
God is viewing us.  We do not have to make our initial appearance at the
rapture in a major way.  God is viewing us as being in Christ, who is in the
Kingdom.  </p>

<p>So when the last day comes, we just go in.  This is all the
result of God having brought us in already.  Now it is just simply the
completion of His salvation.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
