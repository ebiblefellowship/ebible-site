A great deal of Biblical evidence confirms May 21, 2011 as Judgment Day!

* The year 2011 was 7000 years exactly from Noah's flood in 4990 BC.
* The flood began on the 17th day of the 2nd month of Noah's calendar.
* May 21, 2011 was the 23rd year of the *Great Tribulation* which began on May 21, 1988.
* May 21, 2011 was also the 17th day of the 2nd month of the Hebrew/Biblical calendar.
* May 21, 2011 (the 17th day of the 2nd month of the Hebrew calendar) was the landing spot for
the end of the 7000 years space from the flood.
* May 21, 2011 Judgment Day! God shut the door of salvation to the world (as He had shut the
door to the ark 7000 years earlier).
* The book of Esther reveals that Haman (type of Satan) was humiliated and hanged on the 17th
day of the 2nd month (spiritually the equivalent date to May 21, 2011).
* The book of Esther instructs us that Mordecai (type of Christ) was exalted on the 17th day of the
2nd month (spiritually the equivalent date to May 21, 2011).
* The book of Esther reveals that there is a timeline from Haman's death (the 17th day of the 2nd
month, i.e. May 21) until an appointed day of destruction on the 13th day of the 12th month.
* The date selected by lot 12th month, 13th day spiritually points to the fullness of time (#12) and
the end of the world (#13).
* The feast of Purim is chosen by the Lord as the day in which His people (typifying the elect) are
to take vengeance and slay all of their enemies (can only refer to the end of the world).
* The feast of Purim, is the feast of lots (the word Purim means lots).
* The timeline found in the book of Esther goes from the 17th day of the 2nd month until the 13th
day of the 12th month (transferred to our calendar, it is May 21, 2011 until March 7th, 8th, 9th,
2012.
* Purim is a three day feast (see Esther 9).
* Since Purim is a 3 day feast it will result in all the world being on some portion of the feast at the same time.
* Key elements to Purim in the book of Esther: the day chosen by lot arrives/ the Jews stand for
their lives / the Jews destroy all of their enemies/ the Jews rest afterwards.
* After slaying their enemies God's people rest (pointing to the end of the world after all the
enemies of the kingdom of God are destroyed and the elect enter into an eternal rest).
* The feast or Purim identifies with the conquest of the land of Canaan: Joshua and the people of
Israel first had to slay their enemies (Joshua 11:20) and then they rested (Joshua 11:23); finally
the promised land of Canaan (the inheritance) was divided to Israel by lot (Joshua 14:2, 15:1,
16:1, etc., etc.)
* God instructed Daniel: Daniel 12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
