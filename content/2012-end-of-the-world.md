A great deal of Biblical evidence confirms May 21, 2011 as Judgment Day!

* The year 2011 was 7000 years exactly from Noah's flood in 4990 BC.
* The flood began on the 17th day of the 2nd month of Noah's calendar.
* May 21, 2011 was the 23rd year of the *Great Tribulation* which began on May 21, 1988.
* May 21, 2011 was also the 17th day of the 2nd month of the Hebrew/Biblical calendar.
* May 21, 2011 (the 17th day of the 2nd month of the Hebrew calendar) was the landing spot for
the end of the 7000 years space from the flood.
* May 21, 2011 Judgment Day! God shut the door of salvation to the world (as He had shut the
door to the ark 7000 years earlier).
* The book of Esther reveals that Haman (type of Satan) was humiliated and hanged on the 17th
day of the 2nd month (spiritually the equivalent date to May 21, 2011).
* The book of Esther instructs us that Mordecai (type of Christ) was exalted on the 17th day of the
2nd month (spiritually the equivalent date to May 21, 2011).
* The book of Esther reveals that there is a timeline from Haman's death (the 17th day of the 2nd
month, i.e. May 21) until an appointed day of destruction on the 13th day of the 12th month.
* The date selected by lot 12th month, 13th day spiritually points to the fullness of time (#12) and
the end of the world (#13).
* The feast of Purim is chosen by the Lord as the day in which His people (typifying the elect) are
to take vengeance and slay all of their enemies (can only refer to the end of the world).
* The feast of Purim, is the feast of lots (the word Purim means lots).
* The timeline found in the book of Esther goes from the 17th day of the 2nd month until the 13th
day of the 12th month (transferred to our calendar, it is May 21, 2011 until March 7th, 8th, 9th,
2012.
* Purim is a three day feast (see Esther 9).
* Since Purim is a 3 day feast it will result in all the world being on some portion of the feast at the same time.
* Key elements to Purim in the book of Esther: the day chosen by lot arrives/ the Jews stand for
their lives / the Jews destroy all of their enemies/ the Jews rest afterwards.
* After slaying their enemies God's people rest (pointing to the end of the world after all the
enemies of the kingdom of God are destroyed and the elect enter into an eternal rest).
* The feast or Purim identifies with the conquest of the land of Canaan: Joshua and the people of
Israel first had to slay their enemies (Joshua 11:20) and then they rested (Joshua 11:23); finally
the promised land of Canaan (the inheritance) was divided to Israel by lot (Joshua 14:2, 15:1,
16:1, etc., etc.)
* God instructed Daniel: Daniel 12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
stand in thy lot at the end of the days.


## Fill the Cup Double  {#fill-the-cup-double}

In Revelation 9:3-5 we read:

3) And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.\\
4) And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.\\
5) And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment *was* as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. 
{:.verse}

In this study we are going to discuss some things related to the five months of torment that we had thought would take place between May 21 and October 21, 2011.  As we do so, we will find that we were correct in our understanding that God intended to judge the world for a period of five months.  But we will also learn that we were incorrect regarding one of our assumptions about the dating of the five months period of torment.  In this study we will attempt to correct this misunderstanding, and afterwards also see how God's timeline extends from:

1. May 21, 2011 (the beginning of Judgment Day) until the last day of Judgment Day.
2. Five months of torment from May 21 until a date in October 2011, during the feast of tabernacles.
3. From the end of the five months in October 2011 until the feast of Purim in March, 2012.

In other words, we will show from the Bible a tie in from the conclusion of the five months referred to in Revelation chapter 9 until the end of the feast of Purim.  This will give us additional supporting evidence concerning God's plan to spiritually fulfill the feast of Purim (as we have learned previously that the book of Esther joins the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month to the date of May 21, 2011).  As a result of this information we have a direct time path that goes from the date of 2/17 in Esther until the twelfth month feast of Purim.  In this study, we will examine a second link with May 21<sup>st</sup> and the five months of torment that also reaches the feast of Purim.  

### Overview for Arriving at the Date of October 21, 2011 as the End of the World

Back in the year 2005, Mr. Camping published the book entitled: "Time Has an End."  In this book it was pointed out that the year 2011 A.D. was the 7000<sup>th</sup> year from the flood of Noah's day.  It also was explained that the feast of tabernacles was the one main feast yet to be spiritually fulfilled.  
In addition, it was mentioned that the phrase, "last day" was found eight times in the Bible.  This was significant because the phrase "last day" seemed to identify with the end of the world.  And since the phrase "last day" was also used twice in connection with the feast of tabernacles, the conclusion was arrived at that the last day of the feast of tabernacles in the year 2011 would be the probable last day for the world to exist.  Early on, the date selected as the last day for tabernacles was October 20<sup>th</sup> in the year 2011.  But then it was realized that the Bible speaks of an additional day of travel (a 9<sup>th</sup> day related to tabernacles), as a result of this the date was moved one day to October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  This date was selected as the probable date for the return of Christ and the end of the world primarily because it was the last day of the feast of tabernacles in the 7000<sup>th</sup> year from the flood of Noah's day.  

Independent of the date for the last day of the feast of tabernacles was another important date: it was the date of May 21, 2011.  May 21<sup>st</sup> had to be significant because the 23 year great tribulation period (which had begun May 21, 1988) concluded on that day.  It was also an exact 8400 day period for the great tribulation.  For a little while the two dates of October 21<sup>st</sup> and May 21<sup>st</sup> could not be reconciled.  The year 2011 seemed certain---but it was not known upon which of these two likely dates Christ would return.  

Regarding May 21<sup>st</sup>, it was soon noticed that the underlying Hebrew (biblical) calendar date for that day was the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  This was highly significant because that was the very date found in the Genesis account for the shutting of the ark's door and the beginning of the flood.  Let's take a look at that verse once again in Genesis 7:11:

In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the **second month**, the **seventeenth day of the month**, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
{:.verse}

This provided further assurance that May 21<sup>st</sup> was indeed the day to focus upon for the Day of Judgment. But still the question lingered---what about the last day of the feast of tabernacles on October 21<sup>st</sup>?  How did October 21<sup>st</sup> relate to this very important day of May 21<sup>st</sup>?  Eventually, it was noticed that there was a five month space of time between May 21 and October 21, 2011.  This was promising because the Bible's record of the flood also spoke of a 150 day period that the flood waters prevailed: 

Genesis 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
{:.verse}

This was five months of time mentioned immediately after the flood began on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  Also, it was learned that verses found in Revelation 9 went into some detail concerning an awful period of five months. Revelation 9:5,10: 

5) And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.\\
10) And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
{:.verse}

Soon it became apparent that the five months was a period of time God had established in which He intended to bring judgment upon mankind.  May 21<sup>st</sup> would be the beginning of the Day of Judgment; but "Judgment Day" (it was concluded) would be five months in duration.  

### May 21, 2011 Locked in as the Day of Judgment in Three Major Ways

God confirmed May 21<sup>st</sup> was the beginning of the Day of Judgment in three major ways ...
