### Complete Text

Upon saving the last one of His elect, God ended the possibility of salvation for the unsaved people of the world by shutting the door of heaven on May 21, 2011. From that point forward, not one person anywhere in the world has become saved.  Once God shut the door of heaven (a spiritual door that no man could ever see while it was open: nor could they see once it was shut) each person's spiritual condition was permanently fixed and established.  The following Scriptures have now taken effect:

> Revelation 22:10-11 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
{:.verse}

Never again will a sinner be taken out of a life of spiritual darkness and be translated into God's kingdom of light. After thousands of years of sending forth the gospel into the world to find and save lost sinners God's plan was now finally accomplished. The time of judgment had now come upon the world. And the judgment was that there would be no more salvation for mankind. Throughout the Day of Judgment (which is a prolonged period of time beginning on May 21, 2011, for an as yet undisclosed duration) the unsaved will remain unsaved and the saved will remain saved. No one's spiritual condition can be altered. 

**Q?** How can you say that God stopped saving people on that date of May 21, 2011? I thought as long as the world continued God would always save people? 

**A.** In order for us to properly understand what God did in shutting the door of heaven on May 21, 2011, we need to have an overall understanding of God's salvation program.  According to the Bible, every human being stands guilty before God and rightfully deserves the penalty of death for our sins against Him. Since all men are sinners and none are righteous no man could ever do enough good works to earn salvation or cause God to save them. However, God graciously decided to save a portion of mankind (a remnant out of the whole) who were chosen by Him only as a result of His good pleasure.  God selected these people to obtain salvation before any of them were born.  The program of God's election plan was carried out throughout the history of the world and finally, it was completed on the date of May 21, 2011.

## GOD IS SOVEREIGN CONCERNING *WHOM* HE SAVES

The Bible reveals God's complete sovereignty in the matter of those He decided to save:

> Ephesians 1:4-5 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
{:.verse}

The Bible also refers to these "chosen" people as the "elect" of God. 

> 1 Peter 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
{:.verse}

We read that the names of these elect people were recorded by God in a book: 

> Revelation 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
{:.verse}

Of course there's no actual book with the names of the elect written down. This is a figure of speech designed to teach us that God is the One that selected each person He intended to save out of the whole of mankind. This process of election can also be seen in the book of Romans: 

> Romans 9:11-13 (For *the children* being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
{:.verse}

Before either of the twin boys had done any good or evil God determined to love Jacob and to hate Esau. To forgive Jacobs sins, but not to forgive Esau's sins. The Lord's statement concerning these actual twin boys provides us with an excellent example of how God's election program works.  Since Jacob was chosen (and Esau was not chosen) before they were even born, this shows in an amazing way that the good deeds or evil works of a person have nothing to do with whether or not one is a recipient of God's grace.  This is why the Bible says that God chooses according to His own good pleasure.  The Lord, knowing that some people would say that choosing one to love and the other to hate wasn't fair, went on to answer those type of accusations a little further on in Romans chapter 9:

> Romans 9:14-15 What shall we say then? *Is there* unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
{:.verse}

The Bible's teaching of election reveals God as a sovereign King in the matter of exactly whom He foreordained to become saved. God makes no apologies for electing certain ones to become saved.  After all, if all men received their due reward, then none would become saved; we all would perish and be destroyed by God's wrath.  

Human history can rightfully be understood as the period of time God granted life on earth to exist for the sole purpose of God working out His plan of salvation (for the elect) and His plan of judgment (for all non elect). The period of time God gave mankind in which to become saved came to a close on May 21, 2011. It was by that point in time that the Lord had found each and every one of His elect people: all those predestinated to obtain salvation before the world began. Since May 21, 2011 we have entered into the period of God's judgment upon this world due to our sins against Him. We are all presently living in this Day of Judgment. 

However, the elect child of God is not being punished as the unsaved people are being punished for their sins.  The elect child of God is still alive and remaining upon the earth during this present Day of Judgment only to have his faith severely tried before finally entering into the kingdom of God:

> Zechariah 13:9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It *is* my people: and they shall say, The LORD *is* my God.
{:.verse}

## GOD IS ALSO SOVEREIGN CONCERNING *WHEN* HE SAVES

God determined to complete His saving work of the elect during a period of time He referred to in the Bible as the, "Day of Salvation." Once this prolonged "spiritual day" came to an end so also would salvation: 

> 2 Corinthians 6:2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the **day of salvation** have I succoured thee: behold, now *is* the accepted time; behold, now *is* the day of salvation.)
{:.verse}

The acceptable time, the Day of Salvation is also what Jesus spoke of in the gospel of John: 

> John 9:4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
{:.verse}

The work Christ is referring to are the works of salvation the Father gave Him to do:

> John 6:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
{:.verse}

Of course we should not miss the obvious admonition John 9:4 is giving us, that the day would end and when it did the Lord Jesus Christ's work (of salvation) would not be able to be performed in the night that would follow.  During this intense period of spiritual darkness that follows the Great Tribulation the Lord Jesus Christ is no longer performing the work of saving sinners.  The light of the gospel insofar as salvation is concerned has gone out all over the world. 

> Matthew 24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
{:.verse}

Sorrowfully, according to the plan of God the Day of Salvation ended on May 21, 2011 (along with the Great Tribulation period and the Latter Rain), and the spiritual night has come upon the world.  

## SEEKING THE LORD BEFORE THE DAY OF WRATH CAME

It was during the period of time known as the, "Day of Salvation" that God encouraged sinners to come to Him and cry out for mercy, in the hope they might be one of those elect people.  The following passage is typical of this kind of encouragement:

> Zephaniah 2:2-3 Before the decree bring forth, *before* the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD'S anger come upon you. Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.
{:.verse}

Notice, in Zephaniah 2:2-3, God commands man to seek the Lord "BEFORE the day of the Lord's anger come upon you." It is during the time prior to the pouring out of His wrath that God is gracious and merciful and kind towards sinners (if they happen to be one of His elect). But the strong and unmistakable implication is that once the day of His wrath comes to pass there will be no such kindness shown to sinners.  God has been very clear all throughout the Bible that Judgment Day is not a time to seek God for salvation.  Once Judgment Day comes (and it has come) then there is no more mercy granted, no further grace extended, and no additional compassion bestowed upon the ones that have transgressed the law of God.  

> James 2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy;
{:.verse}

The Day of Salvation was in effect throughout the 1955 years of the church age (33 AD through 1988 AD).  Then after the first 2300 evening mornings of the Great Tribulation period, once again in September of 1994 God began to evangelize the world with what the Bible calls the Latter Rain. During this little season of about 17 years God would bring to a climax His salvation program by saving a great multitude of people from the nations of the world.  God opened up the Scriptures at the beginning of the Great Tribulation to reveal a good many truths. Included in this was the information concerning "time and judgment."  The Bible revealed a timeline that included the date for the end of the church age (May 21, 1988) and the date for the beginning of Judgment Day (May 21, 2011).  God moved in His people to broadcast the message of May 21, 2011, Judgment Day, into all the earth and this message of approaching judgment was used by God to apply Christ's atoning work to a great number of people from every nation. The Bible indicates that God saved more people in the short period of the Latter Rain than He did in all previous history.  

> Revelation 7:9,13-14 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; … 13) And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 14) And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, **these are they which came out of great tribulation**, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
{:.verse}

Finally, on May 21, 2011, the Great Tribulation period ended and the Latter Rain came to a close. By this time all the elect captives to sin and Satan were set free by Christ. God's Word had now accomplished its purpose of finding all the lost sheep of the house of Israel. All of the elect, chosen to become saved from before the world began, had now become saved. The Day of Salvation was over. 

## GOD SHUTS THE DOOR OF HEAVEN

There is no question that the Bible clearly teaches that God will shut heaven's door in the Day of Judgment:

> Luke 13:24-25,28 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 25) When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath **shut to the door**, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: … 28) There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.
{:.verse}

We see from this account that once the Master rose up to shut the door He never opened it again.  The pleas of those outside the door did not persuade Him to reverse His decision and open the door.  And the people that found themselves outside the door are never permitted to enter in from their position of being without.

> Revelation 22:14-15 Blessed *are* they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without *are* dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
{:.verse}

Again, it was on May 21, 2011, that God shut the door of heaven. He could now do this since all the people Christ obligated Himself to save (by dying for their sins from the foundation of the world) had now become saved. Once all the elect were safely in the kingdom of God, the door was shut! Therefore, they were as safe in God's kingdom through salvation as Noah and his family were safe inside the ark in the day that the flood began.

> Genesis 7:11,13,16 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the **seventeenth day of the month**, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. … 13) In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; … 16) And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and **the LORD shut him in**.
{:.verse}

The Bible ties together the flood of Noah's day and May 21, 2011 which came exactly 7000 years later (4990 BC + 2011 = 7001 − 1 = 7000). Since May 21, 2011 was the last day of the Great Tribulation period and also fell 7000 years precisely from the date of the flood, and since it also had the underlying Hebrew calendar date of the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month (which matched precisely with the day that God shut the door of the ark and brought the flood to devastate the world), we can be sure that God placed His hand on May 21, 2011 as the day that the door of heaven was shut to the unsaved inhabitants of the earth.

We're not surprised that many today dispute with God over His act of shutting the door of heaven on this world. It is actually in keeping with the nature of mankind. Whenever God makes a sovereign decree we can expect the natural minded man to argue with Him about it. Men do this all the time concerning God's election program regarding whom He saves; and now men are doing the very same thing regarding when God does the saving. 

The shutting of heaven's door is an action performed by God according to His perfect and sovereign will. If God opens something (as He had previously widely opened up the door of heaven to save a great multitude, out of the Great Tribulation) man cannot shut it. Likewise, if God shuts something, no man can open it.

> Revelation 3:7 … he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
{:.verse}

True believers are only humble servants. We are not the ones that determine the times and seasons of God's salvation program: nor do we determine when these times and seasons will conclude in judgment. When it comes to the door of heaven the child of God is simply a doorkeeper:

> Psalm 84:10 … I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
{:.verse}

The Bible reveals that God is the only One possessing the necessary power and authority to make these types of awesome decrees.  It is the Bible that insists that heaven's door is now shut to all the unsaved inhabitants of the earth. Therefore, this teaching comes from the One that issues the decrees to the doorkeepers and not the lowly doorkeepers themselves. 

The child of God, alive and remaining on the earth in the Day of Judgment can only fulfill his role of a humble doorkeeper as he receives instructions from the Word of God, the Bible. It is the Bible that indicates and confirms God's salvation plan ended on May 21, 2011. It is the Bible that declares God brought to pass on that day an awful and terrible judgment, the judgment of shutting heaven's door. This judgment ended Christ's work of saving sinners: a judgment that man could not see with his physical eyes and, therefore, it is a spiritual judgment.

## THE HOPE GOD ALLOWS FOR MANKIND IN THE TIME OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT

**Q?** Are you saying then, that there's no more hope for people to be saved?

**A.** Again, we must be very clear that God is no longer actively saving sinners. He has finished that work. Remember John 9:4 states, "the night comes when no man can work." Christ will not save someone today that is presently unsaved. The Bible indicates that each person's spiritual condition is now eternally fixed.

> Luke 16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that *would come* from thence.
{:.verse}

**Q?** So you're saying all hope is gone? 

**A.** During this time of judgment upon the world the only hope that the Bible allows for, is the hope that maybe God saved a person before He shut the door of heaven on May 21, 2011; that is, if a person was not part of any church and they heard the message from the Bible, then they may hope that God saved them prior to His shutting the door of heaven. A person with this hope in mind may go to God and say, "O Father, having had mercy (before May 21) have mercy."

**Q?** What if a person was part of a church?

**A.** That is a different matter. God ended the church age and commanded His people to leave the churches. God already was not performing the work of salvation in the churches throughout the 23 year judgment upon them (May 21, 1988 through May 21, 2011) and, therefore, anyone remaining in the church before May 21, 2011 could not possibly have become saved while there. Spiritually, this was terrible for them, but things got even worse once the judgment transitioned from the churches to the world (on May 21, 2011) at that point in time, the condition of "no salvation" (which was exclusively in the churches), expanded to include the whole world. Tragically, this means that people in the churches could not have been saved during the glorious period of the outpouring of the Latter Rain and, now, in the Day of Judgment, cannot be saved at all since God has ended His salvation program. The only thing the Bible allows for regarding those in the churches is a prayer in which they may request of God that the cup of wrath be removed from them.

> Matthew 26:39 … O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou *wilt*.
{:.verse}

## GOD COMMANDS US TO FEED HIS SHEEP

**Q?** This is very troubling information, if God isn't saving anyone any longer then why are you sharing it with people?

**A.** You are asking a good question. There are at least three reasons why a true believer desires to share these things with others: First, God commands us to feed His sheep—that is—the majority of those elect people that God saved during the Great Tribulation period (the great multitude) are still alive and living on the earth in this time of judgment. Since we have no idea who these people are, we must share the Bible's teaching openly with all. The things we are sharing are true to God's Word, and it is the sharing of truth that spiritually nourishes and feeds the sheep of God.  Secondly, the last thing many of these people heard from the Bible was that May 21, 2011 would be the Day of Judgment on the world. We want the elect to know that that day, indeed, was Judgment Day—exactly as the Bible revealed.  Thirdly, God commands His people to not be silent but to publish these things. The Lord uses Babylon as a picture of the world under His wrath. It says in Jeremiah 50:

> Jeremiah 50:2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken,
