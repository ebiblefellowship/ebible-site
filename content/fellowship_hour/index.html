      <h1>EBible Fellowship&rsquo;s Fellowship Hour Archives</h1>
      <h3>&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:25</h3>

      <p>Each Sunday evening from 9:00 to 10:00 PM ET,
      <cite>EBible Fellowship</cite> hosts its <cite>Fellowship Hour</cite>.  
      During this time we gather together in the EBible Fellowship
      <a href="/broadcasts/" target="_top">PalTalk room</a> where 
      Chris McCann endeavors to answer all questions relating to the Bible.</p>

<p>MP3 recordings of the <cite>Fellowship Hour</cite> along with their
  transcripts are archived here for you to listen to and read.  
  Since late July of 2006, dedicated volunteers have been transcribing
  each <cite>Fellowship Hour</cite>.  These transcripts are normally
  available by the following Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Recordings are normally posted on the web site within an hour after
  the <cite>Fellowship Hour</cite> has ended.  Fully edited recordings 
  are normally posted as early as two hours later or by the following
  Tuesday morning.</p>
<!--
<p>This program is recorded using an automated process with the recording made
  available ten minutes after the conclusion of that day&rsquo;s program.
  Due to limitations in the automated recording process, there are a few
  extra minutes of other programming before this program starts and after it
  concludes. This raw recording is normally replaced with an edited version
  within two hours or less.</p>
