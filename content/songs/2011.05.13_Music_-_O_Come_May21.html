<h3>Song Lyrics</h3>

<p>The Lord will come to judge the Bible tells.<br>
Prepare to meet thy God, Oh, Israel.<br>
The time has been disclosed, the Book unsealed.<br>
The date of Christ's return has been revealed.</p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
<em>May 21, 2011, the saints will be caught up to heaven.</em></p>

<p>Listen to the watchman sounding.<br>
Warning of a judgment at hand.<br>
This dying world with sin is abounding<br>
From wanton pride of fallen man.<br>
Christ will come to earth to judge the world of sin.<br>
Salvation will have come to an end.</p>

<p>The earth will quake as nations fall.<br>
Too late for those who would not heed the call.<br>
The trump has blown but grace remains today.<br>
Cry out for mercy on your knees and pray.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>
