<p>We were talking about Amos 5.  If you have your Bibles,
please turn back again to Amos 5.  We tried to get through a couple of verses,
and now we will try to move on.  Let me read them again starting in verse 17. 
We read in Amos 5:17-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And in all vineyards <i>shall be </i>wailing: for I will pass
through thee, saith JEHOVAH. Woe unto you that desire the day of JEHOVAH! to
what end <i>is </i>it for you? the day of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>darkness, and not
light. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the
house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.<i> Shall </i>not
the day of JEHOVAH <i>be </i>darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no
brightness in it?  </p>

<p>These are the verses that we were looking at.  We left off at
verse 18.  We found out in verse 17 that the vineyards are the churches of our
day, and God is saying that He is going to pass through these vineyards.  As a
matter of fact, He is not talking about just some of the vineyards.  If you
noticed, it says in Amos 5:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And in <span class="underline">all</span> vineyards&hellip;  </p>

<p>We may have some people who say, &ldquo;I know that the churches
are not teaching this or that, but my church,&rdquo; and we do not have to go any
further because we know that they will say something good about what their
church teaches.  They will say, &ldquo;We follow the Bible,&rdquo; and this, that, and the
other thing.  They usually get up to a certain point before they start going
off in another direction.  But when God says &ldquo;all,&rdquo; this is what He means.  He
means <span class="underline">all</span> of them.  </p>

<p>So there is no church now that God is using.  He is not
using them any longer.  He cannot make this any plainer.  When He says that He
is going to pass through, we saw how this related to the Passover, which was
the time when the destroyer came through Egypt and destroyed all who did not
have the blood over the doorposts and the lintel.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Amos 5:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you that desire the day of JEHOVAH! &hellip;  </p>

<p>First of all, we had established&mdash;actually, the Bible
establishes this; we are just trying to understand it.  But first of all, the
day of Jehovah is the rapture on the one hand.  On the other hand, it is the
first day of Judgment Day.  So it is a two-sided coin, but it is the same day. 
I will just use this analogy.  On one side of the coin is the believer.  On the
other side of the coin is the unbeliever.  </p>

<p>The way God worded this is very interesting because He
starts out with:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you&hellip;  </p>

<p>Personally, I desire the day of Jehovah on the rapture side
of the coin because I want Him to come and get me.  I believe that I am saved,
and every believer may be saying this.  But you do not have to be so relaxed in
your salvation.  </p>

<p>Awhile ago, I had talked about people being at ease as we
looked at Amos 5.  The Lord is giving us this flavor also of someone just
taking it easy in their salvation, &ldquo;Oh, I am saved.  I have done everything
that I needed to do and now I can relax.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, we read about this in the first verse of
Amos 6.  It says in Amos 6:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe to them <i>that are </i>at ease in Zion&hellip;  </p>

<p>Zion is representative of where God&rsquo;s Word should be.  This
is where He is supposed to be worshipped, and yet He starts out this verse by
saying, &ldquo;Woe.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then Amos 6:1 goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and trust in the mountain of Samaria, <i>which are </i>named
chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!  </p>

<p>I do not want to get too far off of the subject, but we do
not want to be at ease as if to say, &ldquo;I have Heaven made.&rdquo;  I am just being sarcastic,
but sometimes you have to say things like this because you cannot play around
with salvation.  You are either saved or you are not saved.  </p>

<p>What happens is that if your salvation is based on you, then
this is when pride comes out and this is what causes you to be at ease.  You
are just resting or relaxing in your salvation or the work that you did to get
you saved, so to speak.  This is a phrase that is used in the churches, &ldquo;I got
saved on a certain day and at a certain time.&rdquo;  They say this because they
believe that they had something to do with it.  When someone tells you this,
you know right away that their salvation is based on something that they did
and not on what the Lord did.  </p>

<p>The Lord tells us this in John 3.  In John 3, the Lord Jesus
is talking to Nicodemus.  We read in John 3:1-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
the Jews: The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that
thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily,
verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
 of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he
enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of </i>the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the
flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that
I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  </p>

<p>Now here it is in verse 8, John 3:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every
one that is born of the Spirit.  </p>

<p>If you are saved, if you have the Spirit of Christ in you,
we read again in this last phrase here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  </p>

<p>No one can tell exactly when the Spirit of God came into
their life.  If you are saved, you have to have the Spirit of Christ.  The
Bible says, &ldquo;Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.&rdquo; 
You are &ldquo;none of his.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So if you are a child of God, you have the Spirit of Christ
living within you.  Do not ask me to explain how this happens, because I cannot
explain this.  But I know what the Bible says and the Bible says that He takes
up residence within us.  I do not know how this happens, but we have to have
the Spirit of Christ.  This is what makes us be born again; however, we do not
know when this happens.  We do not know.  </p>

<p>So when someone says to you, &ldquo;I was born again on June 1,
1999, or whatever, at 6:00 P.M.,&rdquo; chances are that I am just going to say that
it was probably just his own concoction based on a precept of man.  </p>

<p>This is what happens.  You have a precept of man.  The
preacher tells you, &ldquo;Okay, you come up to the front here.&rdquo;  He might put his
hand on your shoulder or on your forehead, or whatever.  Then he says, &ldquo;Repeat
after me.&rdquo;  You repeat it and he proclaims, &ldquo;Oh!  You are a child of the King
now!  You are saved and you are on your way to Heaven!&rdquo;  Everybody is clapping,
but you do not know what to do because you do not know what happened.  Somebody
says, &ldquo;You are going to remember this day,&rdquo; and this and that and the other
thing.  </p>

<p>These are the things that happen.  I know.  I have been
there.  Most of you who are in this room have been there.  Maybe a few of you
have not, but these are the things that happen.  Then people start telling you
that you are going to Heaven, that you do not have to worry about that.  </p>

<p>This is what Amos 6:1 is saying about being &ldquo;at ease in Zion.&rdquo; 
Turn back to Amos 6:1.  I just want to look at this phrase again before I
finish this up:    </p>

<p class="verse">Woe to them <i>that are </i>at ease in Zion&hellip;  </p>

<p>We have the tendency to just take it easy, &ldquo;I have my
salvation sewed up.  I did what I was supposed to do.  It is behind me now.&rdquo; 
Then some people have the mentality, &ldquo;I can do whatever I want to do now.  I
have my salvation locked up in the closet.  I did everything&mdash;one, two, three&mdash;and
now it is locked up.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But this is awful!  It is awful to have this mentality, but
this is the mentality that is in the congregations right now.  Their salvation
is self-made.  It is manmade, and this is exactly what these verses are talking
about here in the book of Amos.  All the way back into the Old Testament, we
can see this attitude.  All this is is an attitude!  </p>

<p>So going back to Amos 5:18 where He is saying:</p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you that desire the day of JEHOVAH! to what end <i>is </i>it
for you?...  </p>

<p>It is either going to be darkness or it is going to be
light.  You are either going to go to Heaven or you are going to start
experiencing the day of judgment.  This is the darkness part of this two-sided
coin.  There are only two.  There is no middle ground.  You are going to
experience one or the other.  </p>

<p>But the way that He worded Amos 5:18, it is as if an individual is ready to go meet the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, come quickly!  Come back
for me!&rdquo;  Then what happens is what God is saying here, which is basically that
someone thinks that they are going to be raptured, when, in actuality, they are
going to go through the judgment.  </p>

<p>This is what He is saying in this verse, and so this right
here has to cause us to examine ourselves.  It has to.  You do not want to wind
up like this person here in Amos 6:1.  You cannot wind up there.  If you wind
up there, you are going to be the one that He is talking about here in Amos
5:18.  He ends this with a question.  He is asking you a question:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;to what end <i>is </i>it for you?...</p>

<p>What is it going to be for you?  Are you going to be
raptured or are you going to experience the first day of judgment?  This is
what this is talking about.  It cannot be but one or the other.  It is either
going to be darkness or it is going to be light.  </p>

<p>Earlier in the first part of this study, we established the
kind of person whom He is speaking to.  It is someone who has a man-made or a
precept-of-man salvation, which is not the salvation of the Bible.  </p>

<p>The whole Bible is serious, but this is why some parts of
the Bible really make your hair stand up on your head.  This is one of them
right here, because this is serious.  This is very serious.  He says that this
day is either going to be darkness or light.  </p>

<p>We took a look at the rapture, so let us take a look at 1
Thessalonians 5.  In 1 Thessalonians 5, we will be able to see these two
different kinds of people, which are the same people that He is talking about
in Amos 5.  We read in 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then
sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and
they shall not escape.  </p>

<p>This is one type of person that we read about in Amos 5, the
one who will experience darkness.  The day of the Lord is going to be darkness
for this person that we are reading about right here because he is saying,
&ldquo;Peace and safety; I have my salvation made in the shade,&rdquo; so to speak.  &ldquo;I am
on my way to Heaven!  The sooner He comes back, the better, because I did
everything the preacher told me to do.  I paid my dues,&rdquo; and so their salvation
is based on the things that they did.  </p>

<p>I am telling you that it is so easy to get caught up in
this.  It is just so easy.  It is so easy that God has to take you out of it. 
It is like a whirlpool.  Once you get in it, the current is so tough that you
cannot get out.  You want to get out, but you cannot get out.  God has to take
you out.  He snatches you out of the kingdom of darkness and places you into
the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.  It is so subtle that this is the only
way that you can get out.  It is subtle and deadly.  </p>

<p>So God is speaking about one of these people here in 1
Thessalonians 5, as the last part of 1 Thessalonians 5:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and they shall not escape.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 1 Thessalonians 5:4-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep,
as <i>do </i>others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep
in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us,
who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and
for an helmet, the hope of salvation.  </p>

<p>God is telling us here that this is the other side of the
coin.  There is one coin.  It is one day.  I am just using the coin as an
illustration of it being the same day.  One side of the coin or the day is
darkness, and the other side of it is light.  So one is for the believer and
one is for the unbeliever, but it is the same day.  </p>

<p>So let us look again at 1 Thessalonians 5 with this question. 
If the day is darkness for you, then you are in these first three verses that
He is specifically talking about.  Look at what they believe in 1 Thessalonians
5:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>How long have we been taught this?  I cannot remember when
we have not.  This is all that I knew.  This is why God is opening up the
understanding of His Word today.  How many times have you read this?  Did it
ever register?  It never registered to me.  I am going to be honest with you. 
It never registered.  All I knew was that the Lord Jesus Christ was going to
come as a thief in the night, a thief in the night, a thief in the night.  That
was it, but it is right here in black and white if you keep reading in 1
Thessalonians 5:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
shall not escape.  </p>

<p>Then He draws a line right here and then says in 1
Thessalonians 5:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren&hellip;  </p>

<p>Now He is turning the coin over, so to speak, and giving us
the contrast between those in the darkness and those in the light.  You see,
they are not doing the same thing.  The same things are not happening to them. 
</p>

<p>So He starts off and says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness&hellip;  </p>

<p>This separates the believer from the unbeliever right here. 
This separates them, and then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that that day&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the day of the Lord that we have been looking at in Amos
5.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;should overtake you as a thief.  </p>

<p>The thief is the Lord Jesus Christ.  That is Him, but we are
not going to be overtaken because we know that He is coming.  He is not surprising
us.  We are not surprised.  The rapture will come and people are going to go
up.  </p>

<p>I would have to say that I have not found this written in
the Bible; however, I believe that it is there.  There are going to be people
who are going to see people go up and they are going to be wondering, &ldquo;What is
going on?&rdquo;  They have not really been reading the Bible and so they do not know
very much about the Bible, plus they are not saved.  So they are not going to
know as much as the people who do read the Bible.  The ones who are in the
vineyards are going to know.  They are going to know what is happening, &ldquo;Hey! 
This is the rapture!  This is it, but I am not going up!  Oh, this cannot be
happening to me.  This cannot be happening!  What happened?  I am seeing this
person and that person going up and I am still here.  I am not supposed to be
here!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Can you imagine?  It is no wonder that He says that &ldquo;there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;  What in the world do you think that
someone would be saying?  It has to be something awful.  They are going to be
mad.  </p>

<p>This is going to affect the people who are referred to in
Amos 5 more than it is going to affect someone who does not know anything about
the Lord.  You see, this is going to affect them much more.  The ones who are
in the churches now are the ones who are just not obeying what the Bible has to
say and who are not taking it seriously enough to even check this out.  Some
might even say, &ldquo;I do not care what the Bible says.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So what they are saying when they say things like this is, &ldquo;I
trust my church more than I do the living God,&rdquo; but this is His salvation; this
is His Word.  This is awful, but this is the bottom line because this is what
is going on.  This is exactly what is going on.  </p>

<p>Going back to Amos 5, we are going to go on to verse 19.  First
of all, He asked this question and then He answers it.  In the last part of
Amos 5:18, He is saying that it is going to be darkness:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the day of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>darkness, and not light.  </p>

<p>What He is saying is that for those who think it is going to
be light, it is going to be darkness for them.  This is the scenario.  Then in
Amos 5:19, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.  </p>

<p>This is a parable.  Whatever this parable is, God is
relating this parable to Amos 5:18.  So let us look at this parable.  He says
again in Amos 5:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the first part of this parable.  The man that He is
talking about in Amos 5:19 is the man that is in Amos 5:18.  The word &ldquo;man&rdquo; is
not there, but this is referring to the situation that the person is in from
Amos 5:18.  The situation is that he thinks that he is going to be raptured,
but he is not.  Now we know why, because his salvation was based on something
other than the Bible.  However, he thinks that his salvation is secure and,
therefore, he is at ease.  This is also the same person who is in Amos 6:1.  </p>

<p>So this man is fleeing from a lion.  Just imagine that you
are running from a lion.  He would be running pretty fast, I would have to
think.  Lions are pretty big and they can run pretty fast, and so he is fleeing
this lion.  This lion is not going to just lick him.  No, this lion is going to
eat whomever he is after, because that is just the nature of a lion.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look now at some verses that deal with a lion,
because we need to know who this lion is.  Who is this lion?  Let us take a
look at Revelation 5:5.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion
of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and
to loose the seven seals thereof.  </p>

<p>The Lion from the tribe of Judah is the Lamb of God, which
is what we read in the next verse, verse 6.  Revelation 5:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain,
having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent
forth into all the earth.  </p>

<p>I will just say it like this.  This lion appears to be the
Lord Jesus Christ, because He is the Lion from the tribe of Judah.  </p>

<p>So the parable in Amos 5:19 said:  </p>

<p class="verse">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him&hellip;  </p>

<p>So the scenario here is that he is running away from the
lion, but he runs into a bear.  He thinks that he is getting away; however, as he
is running away from the lion, the bear meets him.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at this bear.  Turn to 2 Kings 2:23-25. 
We read there:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him,
and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned
back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of JEHOVAH. And there
came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of
them. And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to
Samaria.  </p>

<p>This is talking about Elisha.  We know that Elijah was taken
up to Heaven.  Before he was taken up, Elisha said to Elijah, &ldquo;Let a double
portion of thy spirit be upon me.&rdquo;  So Elijah said to him, &ldquo;If thou see me <i>when
I am </i>taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be
<i>so.</i>&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I just want to make a point of who this is.  Elijah was the
one who went up in &ldquo;a chariot of fire.&rdquo;  Elisha took up &ldquo;the mantle of Elijah
that fell from him,&rdquo; and he had a double portion of his spirit.  God is using
Elisha now, and what we are reading about here is what happened to him at
Bethel.  Apparently, he had a bald head because they were calling him &ldquo;bald
head.&rdquo;  They were making fun of him.  They were mocking Elisha.  </p>

<p>If you are a servant of God, if you are a child of God, you
are an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ.  If people mock you, they are not
really mocking you; they are mocking God.  So this is what happens to people
who mock God.  What happened was that when they finished mocking Elisha, he
cursed them.  </p>

<p>We are not going to do anything like this, but God is
showing us here that we are not to mock God&rsquo;s servants.  We are not to do
this.  We are not to make fun of them or to laugh at them, because God&rsquo;s Word
is serious.  It is serious.  It is so serious that He sent two she bears to
kill 42 children because they were mocking Elisha.  </p>

<p>So we are looking at the word &ldquo;bear&rdquo; and we can see that a
bear is a type of God&rsquo;s judgment.  These children were judged.  Right then and
there, they were judged.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Amos again.  In Amos 5:19, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him&hellip;  </p>

<p>The lion is the Lord Jesus Christ, but the bear is also the
Lord Jesus Christ because He is bringing judgment.  So what He is saying here
is that you cannot get away from His judgment.  You are not going to get away. 
You cannot get away.  No matter what you do, you cannot get away.  If you are
in this situation, if you wind up being this individual who is represented in
verse 18, the one whom He asks this question to in Amos 5:18, you are in big
trouble.  If you are this person, you are not going to get away, no matter how
fast you can run.  Even if you think you have gotten away, you have not gotten
away.  </p>

<p>The other part of this is the second part of verse 19.  It says
in Amos 5:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a
serpent bit him.  </p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;house&rdquo; that he went into?  It is the house of
God.  We need to understand that this person thinks that he is saved.  He is
not really saved.  He thinks that he is saved because of what he did.  They
told him to do this and they told him to do that, and he did those things. 
Therefore, he thinks that he is saved; he is secure in this salvation.  </p>

<p>So now he runs into the house of God where he believes that
he is going to be safe because of his salvation, &ldquo;The church told me this,
that, and the other thing to do.  I am going to run into the church.  If I get
there, I am going to be safe.&rdquo;  He is trying to get to safety, and so he goes
in and leans his hand on the wall to relax.  He feels safe now.  He thinks that
he got away.  Yet when he does this, a serpent bites him.  </p>

<p>Let us see who this serpent is, and then we will look at the
wall.  Let us first go to Isaiah 6.  We will start in verse 1.  This is
referring to the throne of God.  The Bible says in Isaiah 6:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to His throne.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain
he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did
fly.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;seraphims&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;fiery
serpent.&rdquo;  The fact that the seraphims are not only at the throne but that they
are above the throne means that they have to be a type of God as the Judge. 
They have to be because we are talking about God and His throne.  He is not
going to have anything over Him.  </p>

<p>Let us see if this follows.  Let us go all the way back in
the Old Testament to the book of Numbers.  Turn to Numbers 21.  I will start
reading at verse 7.  It says in Numbers 21:7-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
for we have spoken against JEHOVAH, and against thee; pray unto JEHOVAH, that
he take away the <span class="underline">serpents</span> from us&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word that we find in Amos 5:19 where the
serpent bit him on his hand.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;And Moses prayed for the people. And JEHOVAH said unto Moses,
Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass,
that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses
made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a
serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.  </p>

<p>This is the same serpent that we read about in Amos 5, and
so this serpent is a type of God&rsquo;s judgment.  He was judging the people.  In
this judgment, He sent fiery serpents that would bite individuals and they would
die.  Moses went to God and asked Him, maybe even begged Him, to stop these
serpents.  God told Moses to make a serpent out of brass and to put it on a
pole.  When someone got bit, they were to look to the serpent; then they would
be okay.  </p>

<p>God picks this up in the New Testament.  He only gives one
brief verse; however, this ties together who this is.  He says in John 3:14-15: 
</p>

<p class="verse">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have eternal life.</p>

<p>So here is the tie-in.  The serpent is the Lord Jesus Christ
as the Judge.  </p>

<p>Returning to Amos 5, this man ran into the church, the house
of God, and he leaned his hand on the wall.  The hand speaks of the will of
this individual.  He is trusting in what they told him.  This is why he ran
there and then put his hand on the wall.  </p>

<p>So let us take a quick look at this word &ldquo;wall.&rdquo;  We are
going to turn to Ezekiel 8.  We read in Ezekiel 8:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <i>month, </i>in
the fifth <i>day </i>of the month, <i>as </i>I sat in mine house, and the
elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord JEHOVAH fell there
upon me. Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the
appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as
the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. And he put forth the form
of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up
between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to
Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where <i>was

</i>the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.  </p>

<p>When we worship anything other than God, He is jealous. 
What happens is that this provokes Him to jealousy.  This is actually what they
did, and yet this is a picture of what we do.  What we do is that we will take
a doctrine and turn it into something that it is not.  The churches make it
seem like Christ is the One who is lost.  However, we are the ones who are
lost, not God.  </p>

<p>So they take Scripture and they turn it around.  They take
what the Bible says and then they put a twist on it.  They then put you in the
driver&rsquo;s seat, so to speak, but this is very dangerous.  This is very dangerous
and this is very subtle.  This is very subtle because you do not really pick
this up; you just go along for the ride.  Then before you know it, you are &ldquo;at
ease in Zion.&rdquo;  Before you know it, you are there and this is where you will
basically stay unless the Lord takes you out of it, because this is the only
way that you are going to get out of this.  </p>

<p>So Ezekiel is at &ldquo;the door of the inner gate,&rdquo; and then we
read in verse 4, Ezekiel 8:4-6:    </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i>was </i>there,
according to the vision that I saw in the plain. Then said he unto me, Son of
man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes
the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this
image of jealousy in the entry. He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest
thou what they do? <i>even </i>the great abominations that the house of Israel
committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet
again, <i>and </i>thou shalt see greater abominations.  </p>

<p>Is this not what we do?  Is this not what the churches are
doing now?  These things are an abomination to the Lord.  He said that this is
what is in His sanctuary, &ldquo;my sanctuary.&rdquo;  How can they do these things in
God&rsquo;s house?  How can they tell someone that they are saved in God&rsquo;s house? 
This is an abomination.  This is the way in which God sees this.  It is an
abomination to do this.  </p>

<p>As we move on, He says in verse 7, Ezekiel 8:7-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
behold a hole in the wall. Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the
wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. And he said unto me, Go
in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. So I went in and saw;
and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the
idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about. And there
stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in
the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer
in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.  </p>

<p>This is awful.  These are the priests.  The priests with
their incense are supposedly worshipping God, and yet they have all of these
idols on the wall.  These are the abominations that they are worshipping.  </p>

<p>Let me read on.  We read in verse 12, Ezekiel 8:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of
his imagery? for they say, JEHOVAH seeth us not; JEHOVAH hath forsaken the
earth.  </p>

<p>You see, God sees everything.  He sees everything.  This
wall that this man leaned his hand on is a picture of someone taking false
doctrine that he thinks is going to save him and putting his trust in this,
which is just like the people in Jericho and the walls in Jericho.  They
trusted in the walls, but God knocked those walls down and then Jericho was
taken.  </p>

<p>What is your wall?  Is your wall the Word of God?  Are you going
to trust in God&rsquo;s Word or are you going to trust in some doctrine that you were
taught that they say comes from the Bible, a doctrine that will not follow
through or hold water, a doctrine that will not save?  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s Word and His salvation is the only salvation.  It is
the only salvation.  So we want to make sure that we examine ourselves.  For
those who really believe that they are saved, you cannot examine yourself
deeply enough.  You cannot.  You should always be examining yourself.  In the
light of God&rsquo;s Word, examine yourself.  See if you are in the faith.  </p>
