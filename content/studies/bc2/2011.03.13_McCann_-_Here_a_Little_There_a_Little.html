title: Here a Little There a Little
---
<p>Please turn to Isaiah 28.  We read in Isaiah 28:7-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink,
they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink;
they err in vision, they stumble <i>in </i>judgment. For all tables are full of
vomit <i>and </i>filthiness, <i>so that there is </i>no place <i>clean.</i> Whom
shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? <i>them
that are </i>weaned from the milk, <i>and </i>drawn from the breasts. For
precept <i>must be </i>upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line
upon line; here a little, <i>and </i>there a little: For with stammering lips
and another tongue will he speak to this people. To whom he said, This <i>is </i>the
rest <i>wherewith </i>ye may cause the weary to rest; and this <i>is </i>the
refreshing: yet they would not hear. But the word of JEHOVAH was unto them
precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line;
here a little, <i>and </i>there a little; that they might go, and fall
backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This is an interesting passage in the Bible.  God uses this
passage to help us to understand how we must approach the Bible and understand
the Bible, and yet many in the churches today do not follow God&rsquo;s methodology
of coming to truth.  As a result, we find that many do not recognize the
truth.  </p>

<p>I would like to go through this as far as we can.  I will
begin in verse 7.  It says again in Isaiah 28:7:   </p>

<p class="verse">But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
are out of the way&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can use this word &ldquo;erred&rdquo; in different ways.  For
example, &ldquo;I made a mistake.&rdquo;  This is how we use this word.  &ldquo;I erred.  I
should have done or said something else, but I made an error on my part.&rdquo;  But
when the Bible uses this word, it really relates to doctrine.  </p>

<p>We read in Psalm 119:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are </i>cursed, which do err
from thy commandments.  </p>

<p>God has given His commandments and people err from them. 
They go &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; from His commandments.  </p>

<p>We find this also in Proverbs
19:27:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

<p class="verse">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <i>that causeth </i>to
err from the words of knowledge.  </p>

<p>So if you look up this word, you will find that it relates
to Biblical truth, to Biblical teaching and doctrine; and here in Isaiah 28:7,
it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
are out of the way&hellip;  </p>

<p>I think that we can understand the phrase &ldquo;out of the way,&rdquo;
because Jesus is &ldquo;the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo;  To err through drink and
wine and to go &ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; means that they have left the path to Heaven.  They
are no longer on the narrow way.  They are on the broad way &ldquo;that leadeth to
destruction&rdquo;; and God is indicating here that the making of this grievous error
is done &ldquo;through wine, and through strong drink.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I have a couple of verses related to this.  Let us go to the
next chapter of Isaiah.  It says in Isaiah 29:9-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. For
JEHOVAH hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your
eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. And the vision
of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which <i>men </i>deliver
to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot;
for it <i>is </i>sealed: And the book is delivered to him that is not learned,
saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the
Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near <i>me </i>with their mouth, and
with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and
their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: Therefore, behold, I will
proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, <i>even </i>a marvellous
work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise <i>men </i>shall perish, and
the understanding of their prudent <i>men </i>shall be hid.  </p>

<p>God is indicating here that He is not literally talking
about wine or strong drink.  We read again in Isaiah 29:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;They stagger&rdquo; like a drunken man.  </p>

<p>Have you ever seen someone coming out of a bar at 2:00 A.M.?  (If you did, what were you doing out at 2:00 A.M.?)  But have you ever seen
someone coming out of a bar who cannot even walk straight?  He has to hold onto
a wall as he tries to get to his car (that has a designated driver).  He is
staggering because his drinking has hurt his reflexes and his sense of
perception.  At this point, a thorn could go into his hand and he would not
even feel it.  All of this is because of his drinking wine, strong beer, or any
type of alcohol.  </p>

<p>God is using this picture, but He is making sure that we
understand something.  It says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with
strong drink.  </p>

<p>This is a spiritual thing.  This is a spiritual drunkenness
that God has in view.  </p>

<p>Go to Matthew 24.  It says in Matthew 24:42-51:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
</p>

<p>This is Jesus setting the watch for the watchmen.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have
suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an
hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise
servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in
due season? Blessed <i>is </i>that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
find so doing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth
his coming; And shall begin to smite <i>his </i>fellowservants, and to eat and
drink with the drunken; The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he
looketh not for <i>him, </i>and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall
cut him asunder, and appoint <i>him </i>his portion with the hypocrites: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  </p>

<p>So if someone begins to eat and drink with the drunken, then
they will not know the day or hour.  This is what it said in Matthew 24:50:  </p>

<p class="verse">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not
for <i>him, </i>and in an hour that he is not aware of,  </p>

<p>This is because this servant has taken his ease.  He is
eating and he is drinking with the drunken.  As a result, he is a very poor
watchman.  </p>

<p>Jesus started out this passage in Matthew 24 with the
command:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch therefore&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then He spoke well of the servant who gives &ldquo;meat in due
season.&rdquo;  He did not say &ldquo;milk&rdquo; but &ldquo;meat.&rdquo;  Babies start out on milk and then
they have to develop and graduate to meat.  </p>

<p>So the blessed servant, the faithful servant, will give &ldquo;meat
in due season,&rdquo; but then Christ warns those who become drunken and wind up
having no idea about the day or hour of His return.  </p>

<p>If we also go to Isaiah 56, this is a passage that relates
to what is going on today in the church world.  It says in Isaiah 56:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">His watchmen <i>are </i>blind: they are all ignorant, they <i>are
</i>all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.  </p>

<p>Being blind watchmen is a good description of the role of
the churches and congregations of our day.  </p>

<p>Jesus said to watch.  He set the watch.  The churches
recognize this and it is like they are telling the watchmen that it is good for
them to go up to their towers.  Then it is as if they hand them a trumpet and a
looking glass but tell them that, whatever they do, they are to never think that
they can see Christ coming; they are never to think that they can see the enemy
approaching.  </p>

<p>When we read in Ezekiel 33 about the watchman who sees the
sword coming, that sword belongs to the Angel of the Lord.  It belongs to
Christ Himself.  This is God coming in judgment.  </p>

<p>The watchman in Ezekiel 33 can see this; but the instruction
to the church&rsquo;s watchman today is that, first of all, he cannot see this.  It
kind of makes us wonder why they would set someone up in a watchtower if they
cannot watch.  If they cannot watch, it is an impossibility for them to see
anything; and yet they are telling people that Jesus said to watch.  </p>

<p>So it is as if they give the watchman the trumpet and then
they tell him to make sure, no matter what happens, that he never blows the
trumpet; that he definitely never blows it with a certain sound.  But we read
in 1 Corinthians 14:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
himself to the battle?  </p>

<p>This is referring to the battle of Armageddon, but the
churches instruct their watchmen not to blow the trumpet.  They are to take it
with them, and yet they are not to blow it.  They are not to wake the people. 
They are not to disturb them with this information about the enemy coming with
a sword.  </p>

<p>This is ridiculous, and yet, basically, this is what they
are doing.  This is why God is mocking them.  God is mocking them here in
Isaiah 56:10 as He indicates:  </p>

<p class="verse">His watchmen <i>are </i>blind&hellip;  </p>

<p>They cannot see their faulty teachings.  The errors of their
pastors and priests and the errors of the theologians have blinded their eyes
to where they cannot believe that we can know the timing of Christ&rsquo;s return.  </p>

<p>So Isaiah 56:10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">His watchmen <i>are </i>blind&hellip;they <i>are </i>all dumb dogs,
they cannot bark&hellip;  </p>

<p>They are like a dog that &ldquo;cannot bark.&rdquo;  This would be like
putting a guard dog in a junkyard that could not bark.  Would you put a dog in
there if he could not bark?  A dog that cannot bark has no sound coming out of
his mouth.  It would not be possible for him to scare away a thief and to warn
anyone that the thief was there, because he cannot bark.  This is how God is
describing the churches of our day.  </p>

<p>Then we find &ldquo;drink&rdquo; again in Isaiah 56:12.  God says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Come ye, <i>say they, </i>I will fetch wine, and we will fill
ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, <i>and </i>much
more abundant.  </p>

<p>It is the drink that is making them think that tomorrow will
come, that day after day will follow.  They are quite relaxed.  This is why
they are basically saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety,&rdquo; as they take their ease.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Proverbs 31 where we also read about &ldquo;wine&rdquo; and
&ldquo;strong drink.&rdquo;  We read in Proverbs 31:4:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>It is </i>not for kings, O Lemuel, <i>it is </i>not for kings
to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  </p>

<p>This is instruction for all of God&rsquo;s people.  It is not for
us to physically drink alcohol, to have a glass of wine, to have a beer or to have
a drink.  This is not for the people of God, because we do not need this.  We
do not need this because God has enabled and equipped us to face life soberly
with a sound and sober mind.  We do not need any assistance.  We do not need
any help to get through the day, because God is our help.  He is our aide. 
When things go wrong, we go to Him and we cast our burdens upon Him.  </p>

<p>Then look at what it goes on to say in the following
verses.  We read in Proverbs 31:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of
any of the afflicted.  </p>

<p>On a physical level, we can see how the Bible is difficult
enough to understand when someone is in their right mind and has their wits
about them; but to drink and then to try to understand the Bible would be
nearly impossible.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Proverbs 31:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and
remember his misery no more.  </p>

<p>What is man&rsquo;s &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;?  What is the &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; of the
richest people on earth?  Their poverty is that they are not saved.  Their sins
are upon them and they are subject to the wrath of God because of them.  </p>

<p>Turn to Proverbs 10.  Proverbs 10:15 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The rich man&rsquo;s wealth <i>is </i>his strong city: the destruction
of the poor <i>is </i>their poverty.  </p>

<p>This is referring to an unsaved individual.  Because they
are subject to destruction, they are very poor.  </p>

<p>We are aware of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. 
While the rich man lived, no one would have thought that he was poor; and yet
he was.  He was very poor.  This was proven once he died and ended up in the &ldquo;place
of torment.&rdquo;  Lazarus had no money.  He was a beggar who had poor medical care
and someone who was full of sores.  It says that &ldquo;moreover the dogs came and
licked his sores,&rdquo; and yet he had everything.  He had true spiritual riches,
because he was a child of God.  </p>

<p>The Bible indicates this in Revelation 3:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,
and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the
fire, that thou mayest be rich&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the true state of man.  We are &ldquo;wretched, and
miserable, and poor,&rdquo; because our destruction is our &ldquo;poverty.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what Proverbs 31 [<i>Note: Chris inadvertently
referred to Proverbs 30</i>] is getting at when it says in Proverbs 31:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and
remember his misery no more.  </p>

<p>This is what people do.  They drink and they forget their
worries.  They forget their troubles.  It makes it easier.  It&rsquo;s been a long
and hard week, and then Friday night and Saturday comes around and it is time
to drink and to relax; and yet there is also a spiritual meaning to this.  </p>

<p>If one&rsquo;s poverty is their destruction, what kind of drink, in
a spiritual sense, could make them forget this?  What could make them forget
this is a gospel that teaches people that they can accept Christ or that gives
them certain steps to do in order to get saved.  They then make them believe
that they are no longer subject to destruction.  They wind up believing that
they are no longer subject to being eternally destroyed on May 21 or on any
other day.  This is what they think.  </p>

<p>When individuals go to churches that are teaching these
kinds of gospels, or when people place themselves under the hearing of these
types of gospels, it is like drinking in strong drink and wine, in a spiritual
sense.  They are becoming drunk with the idea that they are now right with
God.  </p>

<p>This is an illusion.  This is not fact and this is not
true.  Nothing changes when someone walks down an aisle and accepts Christ.  No
one truly becomes saved from doing this, and yet this is what people think.  This
is one of the reasons for why God is using this kind of language.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Isaiah 28:7, it says in about the middle of
the verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink,
they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, they have wandered astray from the true way of
salvation.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
vision, they stumble <i>in </i>judgment.  </p>

<p>This is referring to &ldquo;the priest and the prophet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Jeremiah 8:10.  It says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore will I give their wives unto others, <i>and </i>their
fields to them that shall inherit <i>them: </i>for every one from the least
even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the
priest every one dealeth falsely.  </p>

<p>This is referring to religious leaders, to those who are
ruling in the churches and congregations.  We can apply this to them.  In Israel,
the prophet would supposedly declare what God had said.  The priest would put
this into action and then minister these things to the people.  </p>

<p>Look at Jeremiah 5:30-31.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; The
prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means&hellip;  </p>

<p>So these prophets were to declare the word of God.  </p>

<p>To update this to our modern times, this means that this is
referring to the churches and to those who teach in the churches.  They speak
forth and declare the Word of God.  They have their theologians who say, &ldquo;This
is what the Bible is saying,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;the priests bear rule&rdquo; by these things,
by the &ldquo;tradition of men,&rdquo; by the &ldquo;precept of men,&rdquo; by the &ldquo;doctrines of men,&rdquo;
which are all the gospels of men.  God takes notice of this and He is telling
us that they &ldquo;prophesy falsely.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>A lot of times, we do identify the pastors and the ministers
and the priests as the culprits, because God does this often in the Bible, but
they are not alone.  Look at the rest of Jeremiah 5:31.  After God says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
means&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and my people love <i>to have it </i>so: and what will ye do in
the end thereof?  </p>

<p>The congregation is not guiltless.  Who put these men in these
positions?  Who keeps these men in these positions?  It is the congregation. 
Why do they do this?  Why do they not run them out of the church when they are
teaching these things?  The answer is because they want them to teach these
things.  They love to have these things so, to have salvation in their own
hands, to be able to get themselves saved by a simple choice or to be baptized
and have the church indicate that their sins are washed away.  </p>

<p>Whatever the church is indicating through any kind of a
work, it is false; but the people remain because they like it and they want it,
and this is the way that they want it; and so God is pointing this out. 
However, there will be &ldquo;greater damnation&rdquo; and &ldquo;greater condemnation.&rdquo;  Even
so, the people are also involved with this.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Isaiah 28.  It says in Isaiah 28:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">For all tables are full of vomit <i>and </i>filthiness, <i>so
that there is </i>no place <i>clean.</i>  </p>

<p>When people drink too much, this is what follows.  A lot of
times, they vomit.  They drink too much for their body and their system cannot
handle it, and so they vomit.  This is the analogy that God seems to be
following here.  This also says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For all tables&hellip;  </p>

<p>If you remember Psalm 23, it says that the Lord &ldquo;preparest a
table before me in the presence of mine enemies.&rdquo;  This is the word that is
actually used for &ldquo;table&rdquo; in relation to the showbread being on a table.  </p>

<p>I think that God is relating this to how He serves His
people.  He gives them bread.  He gives them drink.  He gives them spiritual
nourishment, and yet through false teachings and gospels, which are likened
here to strong drink and wine, the tables are made very unclean.  It is not the
beautiful &ldquo;table of the LORD&rdquo; that He sets for His people in the presence of
their enemies, but it is a very ugly and filthy table.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Isaiah 28:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine?&hellip;  </p>

<p>If we were to sum this up, God is asking the question, &ldquo;Who
will be able to understand the Bible and how will they be able to understand
it?&rdquo; because He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine?&hellip; </p>

<p>Luke 24 is the chapter that speaks of Christ rising from the
dead, and it says in Luke 24:44-45:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, These <i>are </i>the words which I spake
unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in </i>the prophets, and <i>in </i>the
psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
the scriptures,  </p>

<p>It takes God&rsquo;s action for anyone to understand the Bible. 
It takes His opening of the mind of understanding for us to understand
annihilation, for us to understand the end of the church age, for us to
understand the date of judgment and the five months.  In all of these things,
God is in control of who is able to understand them and see them and who
cannot, and He does this through a very definite way.  God has a methodology
that He lays out in the Bible that must be used in order to come to
understanding.  He speaks of this in Isaiah 28:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">For precept <i>must be </i>upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and </i>there a little:  </p>

<p>What is the best way of summing this up?  The Bible actually
does sum this up in the New Testament when He says, &ldquo;comparing spiritual things
with spiritual.&rdquo;  We are to compare Scripture with Scripture.  This is a
description of what it means to compare &ldquo;spiritual things with spiritual.&rdquo;  We
are to compare &ldquo;precept upon precept.&rdquo;  A precept is a law, and the whole Bible
is a Law Book.  Notice also that God doubles this:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;precept <i>must be </i>upon precept, precept upon precept; line
upon line, line upon line&hellip;  </p>

<p>When we read, we read one line and then we go to the next
line.  This is what we do as we go all through the Bible.  We go &ldquo;line upon
line.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s way.  This is His methodology for coming to
truth.  This is the way that He shall &ldquo;teach knowledge&rdquo; and this is His way of
making people &ldquo;to understand doctrine.&rdquo;  It is &ldquo;here a little, <i>and</i> there
a little.&rdquo;  It is here in Isaiah, and then we go over to 1 Corinthians 2.  We
are &ldquo;here a little&rdquo;; now let us go &ldquo;there a little.&rdquo;  It says in 1 Corinthians
2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Holy Ghost teacheth,&rdquo; and so if we are following the
Bible&rsquo;s hermeneutic of &ldquo;precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line;
here a little, <i>and </i>there a little,&rdquo; if we are being very careful by
checking out one word to see how it is used in other places, and if we then
look at the context of what God is speaking about to see how this is addressed
in other places, then we are following the way God wants us to follow.  </p>

<p>The only other thing is that we have to harmonize and fit
our conclusion.  Like the pieces of a puzzle, everything has to fit in its
place.  If something is not fitting, then you stop.  You never say, &ldquo;The Bible
has a lot of verses to support a teaching.  Even though there are a couple of
verses that do not support it, I have more that do.  Therefore, this is what I
am going to teach.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But, no; you have a couple of verses that do not support
your conclusion.  God needs to then open your eyes to see how they fit.  Once
they do, you can be sure and say that the Bible guarantees it.  You can then
say, &ldquo;Absolutely, this is what the Bible says.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what has happened with this information about
Judgment Day being on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  God locked this in.  All of the
pieces fell into place and now we know.  Now we know and we can be sure of it. 
We can also be sure that this is not a man&rsquo;s teaching, which is very
important.  </p>

<p>Again, notice that it says in 1 Corinthians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  </p>

<p>So &ldquo;the Holy Ghost teacheth,&rdquo; but I thought that I was
listening to Mr. Camping.  I was; but since he followed God&rsquo;s methodology and
he did it carefully and it fit with the whole Bible, it was God teaching.  It was
the Holy Spirit who was teaching.  </p>

<p>This is where a lot of people are making a mistake.  This is
where the charge of Camping-ite comes from.  They think that we are following a
man.  No; no.  We hear the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s voice.  We hear Christ&rsquo;s voice.  We
check it out and we see that the Bible is teaching this; and, yes, God used an
individual to bring this forth.  How could He bring this forth without using an
individual?  I do not know.  Nobody ever gets into this.  He had to use
somebody.  He had to use Louis Pasteur to find a vaccine that others could then
build upon.  It had to be an individual that invented one thing or another and
then others built upon their work.  </p>

<p>So here God is saying that this is what we are to do.  We
are not to look for the plain and literal meaning and to seek no other
meaning.  The Bible does not tell us to do this.  The Bible does not say, &ldquo;Try
to find out what this meant to the people of that day.&rdquo;  It does not tell us to
do this.  It says to compare &ldquo;spiritual things with spiritual&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
Holy Ghost teacheth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look now at Mark 13.  This is a parallel chapter to Matthew
24 and it is dealing with Jesus answering the disciples&rsquo; question, &ldquo;What <i>shall
be </i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&rdquo;  In Mark 13:11, it
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when they shall lead <i>you, </i>and deliver you up, take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is an incredible statement!  God tells us to &ldquo;meditate
upon these things.&rdquo;  Yes; we were definitely to mediate and to think about what
we were going to say.  We were to &ldquo;<i>be </i>ready always to <i>give </i>an
answer to every man that asketh you.&rdquo;  Do you not have to premeditate to do this? 
Why is He saying not to premeditate at some point?  Why were we not to
premeditate or to think on these things?  </p>

<p>The reason was because the information about the end was
sealed up.  It was sealed up and if you tried to come up with an answer to the
solution to the end of the world and all that the Bible had to say about
eschatology and the end times when it was the year 500 A.D. or 1,000 A.D. or
1500 A.D., you should not have bothered.  You should not have bothered, because
you were not going to come to truth.  </p>

<p>Of course, this knowledge was sealed up along with
everything else; but if people had listened to God, we would not have pre-mill
eschatology and post-mill eschatology and a-mill eschatology and all of the
errors that are out there in the churches.  However, they went ahead and did
think, &ldquo;This is how it is going to be,&rdquo; and commentaries were written by the
theologians, and yet God is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is because it is in the hour of judgment, the hour of
the Great Tribulation, when this information would be opened up.  Then it goes
on to say, &ldquo;that speak ye&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>How does the Holy Ghost speak?  It is not through a dream or
a vision or a tongue.  God has said that He will not do this.  </p>

<p>So God is saying, &ldquo;In that hour, you are going to speak; but
it is not really you; it is the Holy Ghost.  It is Me.  I am going to speak in
that hour.&rdquo;  This is referring to &ldquo;the hour of his judgment&rdquo; that the book of
Revelation speaks of, &ldquo;the hour&rdquo; of the Great Tribulation.  This is when God is
going to speak.  </p>

<p>He just told us in 1 Corinthians 2 how He speaks.  We read
again in 1 Corinthians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  </p>

<p>When you teach, you have to speak.  God is not just somehow
making people understand these things apart from speaking, but He is moving His
people to speak or to teach.  Since they are following His way that He has laid
out, then He says that He is the One speaking.  </p>

<p>This is what is going on today.  It is not really Family
Radio.  It is not the individual believers, but it is God.  Actually, in this
verse, God is basically taking full responsibility for the doctrines and for
the teachings that are being taught at this time.  </p>

<p>So if someone does not like what is being opened up at this
time, if someone does not like that there is no place called &ldquo;hell&rdquo; where
people were to suffer forevermore &ndash; how anyone cannot like this, I do not know
because this is a wonderful mercy of God &ndash; but if someone does not like this,
their issue is with the Holy Ghost; because the Bible has revealed this and the
Scriptures indicate this when we go &ldquo;here a little, <i>and </i>there a little.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Precept upon precept; line upon line,&rdquo; the Bible is teaching this.  Therefore,
God Himself is teaching this; and so if someone does not like this, their
problem is not with man; it is with God.  </p>

<p>Going back to Isaiah 28:9, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine? <i>them that are </i>weaned from the milk, <i>and </i>drawn
from the breasts.  </p>

<p>In Hebrews 5, God also uses this kind of language.  Towards
the end of chapter 5, He says in Hebrews 5:12-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
one teach you again which <i>be </i>the first principles of the oracles of God;
and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one
that useth milk <i>is </i>unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a
babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, <i>even </i>those
who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. 
</p>

<p>God is speaking about His Word and He is relating it to
those who drink milk and to those who can eat meat, &ldquo;strong meat.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you have had children, you know how this is.  For quite
awhile after they are born, they drink milk.  Then you start slowly giving them
more and more food until they can eat solid food.  At some point, they can eat
meat.  </p>

<p>So God is using this picture of those who are involved with
the Gospel and reading the Bible.  They start out with milk, but they have to
progress.  It is fine for a baby to drink milk; but if someone who is 10 or 15
or 20 or 40 years old drinks nothing but milk, they are going to have a
problem.  They would be someone who would experience stunted growth.  In this
case, spiritually, what we have is people who are not moving on to the more
complete teachings of the Bible.  They are stuck.  </p>

<p>In the churches today, the reason that they are stuck on
doctrines that are for babes and have not moved onto perfection is because of
their hermeneutic.  They do not follow comparing Scripture with Scripture. 
They follow other kinds of teachings, other kinds of ways that they think will
bring them truth; and yet what they are doing hinders them and holds them back
from truth so that they cannot understand things as they should.  </p>

<p>So Hebrews 5:14 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But strong meat belongeth to them that are of <span class="underline">full age</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Greek word that is translated here as &ldquo;full age&rdquo; is <i>teleios</i>. 
This is found 19 times in the New Testament.  It is translated as &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; 17
times.  It is translated once as &ldquo;full age,&rdquo; and it is translated once as &ldquo;men.&rdquo; 
These are the only times that this word is found.  </p>

<p>For instance, it says in Matthew 5:48:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be ye therefore <span class="underline">perfect</span>, even as your Father which is in
heaven is <span class="underline">perfect</span>.  </p>

<p>These are two instances of this word <i>teleios</i>.  He
says here, &ldquo;Be ye therefore perfect.&rdquo;  We know that God is perfect, and He is
commanding us to be perfect.  In all things, this is His standard.  His
standard is absolute perfection.  If you fall short, you &ldquo;come short of the
glory of God&rdquo; and you sin against the Law of God; but there is also a standard
of &ldquo;perfect knowledge,&rdquo; of &ldquo;perfect understanding.&rdquo;  Men fall short of this,
too, and have fallen short throughout the whole church age.  </p>

<p>We are now living at a time when God is opening the
Scriptures and revealing the fullness of all that He wants His people to
understand and to know.  He is really bringing His people &ldquo;unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.&rdquo;  He is filling up
our understanding to the degree that He had meted out, and God&rsquo;s people are
learning all kinds of things.  </p>

<p>We are just presently learning about the good possibility of
there being a rolling earthquake.  This was more information that we could not
understand until we had all of this other information.  As this is looked at,
according to His timetable, He opens up the Scriptures.  </p>

<p>Let us look at this word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; as it is found in
Ephesians 4:13.  We read in Ephesians 4:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, unto a <span class="underline">perfect</span> man, unto the measure of the stature
of the fulness of Christ: That we <i>henceforth </i>be no more children, tossed
to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are to become perfect in knowledge.  We are to become
like God; that is, God knows perfect truth.  Therefore, we must reach this
standard.  Then we will &ldquo;be no more children.&rdquo;  We put away the &ldquo;milk,&rdquo; and now
we have the &ldquo;strong meat.&rdquo;  We come to truth and we are no longer &ldquo;carried
about&rdquo; with this teaching and with that teaching and with all of the errors
that are out there.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Corinthians 14:20, which also has this word <i>teleios</i>. 
1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter that is dealing with tongues, as God indicates
that tongues were permissible for the church at Corinth.  In the church at Corinth,
tongues were permissible by God until the Bible was completed.  Afterwards,
tongues were never permissible by God again, because God would not be
communicating in this way.  He would communicate only through His Word.  We
read in 1 Corinthians 14:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Brethren, be not children in understanding&hellip;   </p>

<p>We will again find this word <i>teleios</i> and it is in the
context of not being a child.  This is related to doctrine, to understanding. 
It continues on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice [<i>or
evil</i>] be ye children, but in understanding be <span class="underline">men</span>.  </p>

<p>This is the word <i>teleios</i>.  Like &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; in Matthew
5:48 or the word translated &ldquo;full age&rdquo; in Hebrews 5, we are to be perfect in
understanding.  This is what God is doing today.  </p>

<p>Turn to the previous chapter in 1 Corinthians.  It says in 1
Corinthians 13:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be </i>prophecies,
they shall fail; whether <i>there be </i>tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there
be </i>knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part.  </p>

<p>When?  When did we know &ldquo;in part&rdquo;?  When did we prophesy &ldquo;in
part&rdquo;?  Is this what we are doing today?  </p>

<p>No; this is referring to the church age.  As God was moving
Paul to write this in the first century A.D., is it not true that the church
only knew &ldquo;in part&rdquo;?  They did not have all kinds of information that we have
today.  If you think that they had understanding in everything, just look at the
church&rsquo;s teaching on baptism or look at their teaching on salvation.  In many,
many churches and in probably all of them in some way or another, they teach
that salvation is up to an individual.  </p>

<p>So this statement in 1 Corinthians 13:9 is a statement that
was dealing with the 1,955 years of the church age:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 1 Corinthians 13:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away.  </p>

<p>Is this referring to Heaven?  Is this referring to May 21<sup>st</sup>
when God takes His people up into Heaven?  Is this saying that it is then that
the &ldquo;perfect is come&rdquo; and when &ldquo;that which is in part shall be done away&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>No; this is not referring to Heaven.  This is referring to
now.  It is now, because now is when we are being corrected and given &ldquo;strong
meat.&rdquo;  God is giving us understanding of numerous doctrines and teachings in
our day.  </p>

<p>So then, who is perfect?  God is perfect.  When is God going
to come?  This is a little misleading:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when that which is perfect is come&hellip;  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  </p>

<p>Let us go to John 16.  It says in John 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is perfect, just as God is perfect.  The
Bible says, &ldquo;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>So &ldquo;when that which is perfect is come,&rdquo; then we can be
expected to be guided into &ldquo;all truth&rdquo;; not partial truth, but &ldquo;all truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did this happen in Acts 2?  No; the church understood partly
and they prophesied partly.  </p>

<p>So when was this going to happen?  This was going to happen
during the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  This is what is happening
during the &ldquo;latter rain&rdquo; in our day when the seals are being taken off of the
Bible.  Christ, the Holy Spirit, is guiding His people into &ldquo;all truth,&rdquo; into
perfection, into a perfect understanding of what the Bible has to say.  We do
not understand everything in the Bible, but we understand everything that God
wants us to understand.  </p>

<p>This is kind of like the Trinity.  We understand that there
is a Trinity.  We understand that God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, &ldquo;these three are one&rdquo;; but we do not really understand this.  We do not
know how this is possible.  </p>

<p>We also understand that God is eternal and that He has
always been without beginning.  We understand this, but we do not really
understand this.  How can this be?  </p>

<p>Everything that God wants us to know at this time, He is
opening up.  Since He is probably opening up something new right now concerning
a rolling earthquake, we can be sure by the time that we get to the last day
that &ldquo;the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&rdquo; will be given to
us.  </p>

<p>This is what 1 Corinthians 13:10 is telling us:   </p>

<p class="verse">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away.  </p>

<p>It is hard to change and I do not like it.  I was at work
when they first brought in computers.  We had to stop doing the written
timesheets and we had to do them online.  I did not like this at all.  I am not
really comfortable with change, and neither are a lot of other people in many
areas of their lives, neither is the church and neither is national Israel.  </p>

<p>This is what happened to national Israel when God brought
about the change that the Gospel was to include the Gentiles.  It always had,
but there came a time when it was stated very clearly and boldly that the
Gentiles would also be &ldquo;heirs of salvation,&rdquo; and the Jews rejected this.  They
rejected Christ as the Messiah.  They wanted a certain stability in keeping
their traditions that they had been following, because their &ldquo;prophets prophesy
falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means.&rdquo;  This was their gospel and
their church.  Up until today, nearly 2,000 years later, they still hold to
this in stubbornness and in rebellion against God.  In essence, they are
saying, &ldquo;This is the way that we are comfortable in worshipping and we will not
change.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is exactly the same with the churches of our day.  God
is coming and He has &ldquo;done away&rdquo; with this teaching and with that doctrine.  He
has put it away.  Here is the truth.  There is no place called &ldquo;hell.&rdquo;  There
is no place of eternal torment.  God annihilates sinners.  </p>

<p>How many cannot accept this truth?  This is like Peter who,
at first, refused when the unclean animals were brought down on a sheet and
said, &ldquo;Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or
unclean.&rdquo;  But God was indicating that He had made a change.  The only
difference was that He brought Peter around.  He changed him and brought him around
to understand the truth.  </p>

<p>God will do this for His people, even if, initially, we are
stubborn.  We can be stubborn, too, but God will do this for His people.  </p>

<p>Then in 1 Corinthians 13:11, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
child&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, He is referring to a &ldquo;babe,&rdquo; to little children, to
the understanding of little children who are on &ldquo;milk.&rdquo;  They need to go on. 
They need to graduate to meat.  </p>

<p>Baby food used to be graduated.  The little children
graduated up to the carrots and the peas.  Then they graduated up to the meat
sticks.  I will not tell you how long my children ate the meat sticks, because
they really liked them.  </p>

<p>So you have to move on.  You cannot stay on milk.  This is
not possible.  If you remain believing the partial truths that your churches
are teaching and you do not humble yourself and bring yourself &ldquo;under the
mighty hand of God&rdquo; and submit to what He is teaching through His Word, you are
going to be destroyed.  Shortly, you are going to face this destruction.  This
will come upon you &ldquo;as a thief,&rdquo; because your hermeneutic, your methodology for
studying the Bible, forces you into blindness; it forces you not to understand
and see these things.  As an individual, you need to go to God and to ask Him
to &ldquo;guide you into all truth:&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So 1 Corinthians 13:11 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.  </p>

<p>Turn over to the next chapter, to 1 Corinthians 14.  Maybe
God had a reason for allowing the translators to translate 1 Corinthians 14:20
in this way:  </p>

<p class="verse">Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
ye children, but in understanding be men.  </p>

<p>Be grown up.  Be one who is brought to completion and
perfection.  Do not be a little child any longer, but be a man and put away
these childish doctrines.  Put away the idea that you can do anything to get
yourself saved or that you can repent unto salvation.  No; put all of these
things away.  </p>

<p>Finally, we read in 1 Corinthians 13:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For now&hellip;</p>

<p>This would be referring to the church age.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I
know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.  </p>

<p>God used the language of &ldquo;face to face&rdquo; for a good reason. 
When He speaks &ldquo;face to face,&rdquo; it is plain and not in similitude; that is, He
is making the Scriptures understandable.  </p>

<p>This is like when God spoke to Moses.  The Bible tells us, &ldquo;And
the LORD spake unto Moses face to face.&rdquo;  We know that God gave revelation to
Moses directly.  </p>

<p>So this is referring to a very clear form of speaking or
communicating.  This is what God is doing now with His people.  &ldquo;Face to face,&rdquo;
He is making these things plain.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
