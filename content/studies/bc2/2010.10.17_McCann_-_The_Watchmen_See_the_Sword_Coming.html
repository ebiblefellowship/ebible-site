  This message continues on the topic "The Trumpet is Sounding".
---
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we were looking at the trumpet and
sounding the trumpet.  We know that when Christ comes, it is at the sound of &ldquo;the
last trump.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It says in 1 Thessalonians 4:16:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first:  </p>

<p>We also find this language in 1 Corinthians 15:52:  </p>

<p class="verse">In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for
the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
shall be changed.  </p>

<p>This is referring to May 21<sup>st</sup>.  God&rsquo;s people will
be changed at this point.  </p>

<p>However, there is also information in the Bible that tells
us that God is sounding the trumpet now.  He is sounding the trumpet and the
trumpet is designed to warn people.  It is the equipment that a watchman would
have.  He would have a trumpet, as he would be in the watchtower to warn the
people of what is coming.  </p>

<p>We read in Ezekiel 33:2-4:    </p>

<p class="verse">Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man
of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: If when he seeth the sword
come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; Then whosoever
heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come,
and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the individual&rsquo;s role as a child of God
to be a watchman.  We are to keep a watch and a lookout to see when the sword would
be coming upon the land.  When we see the sword, we are to blow the trumpet and
warn the people; and yet what relationship does the blowing of the trumpet
have, for example, with Christ coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>I ask this because of something that is widely proclaimed in
the church.  I actually do not know of any church that does not teach this. 
The churches say that Christ is coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night,&rdquo; or they
quote, &ldquo;But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, if Christ is coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night,&rdquo; this
means that you cannot see His coming.  According to the way in which they
understand this, no man can know.  If this is so, what is the purpose of a
watchman?  If you think about this, what is the purpose for setting a watch?  </p>

<p>This would be like having a man who has his trumpet with him
up in the watchtower and who maybe has a looking glass so that he can see far
off and then giving him instructions, &ldquo;By the way, do not ever blow the
trumpet.  Do not ever blow the trumpet and wake us up in the middle of the
night to tell us that an enemy is coming, because you can actually never know. 
You can never see an enemy approach or an enemy come with the sword.  You are a
watchman; however, whatever you do, do not blow the trumpet!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we have to ask the question: what is the point in setting
a watch if you give the watchmen instructions that indicate, first of all, they
will never actually be able to see an enemy coming and that, secondly, they
should certainly never blow the trumpet?  There does not seem to be any point
in this and there is not.  </p>

<p>God mocks this idea, but I also did a little mocking myself
and I need to watch that.  I mentioned the 1960&rsquo;s TV Show &ldquo;F Troop&rdquo; and how
they had a character by the name of Vanderbilt up in a watchtower.  Anyone who
watched this show knows what I mean.  Vanderbilt wore glasses and could barely
see.  He would squint his eyes, but he could not see his hand in front of his
face.  They would place him in a watchtower, which was a ridiculous thing to
do.  It was ridiculous to put a blind man in a watchtower, but it was a comedy
and this was one of many jokes.  Was it not silly and stupid to put a blind man
in a watchtower to watch for Indians when he could not even see his hand in
front of his face?  </p>

<p>Well, God Himself mocks the churches of today in the book of
Isaiah.  In Isaiah 56, He is referring to Israel; but remember that Israel is a
type and a figure of the church.  We read in Isaiah 56:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">His watchmen <i>are </i>blind: they are all ignorant, they <i>are
</i>all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea,
<i>they are </i>greedy dogs <i>which </i>can never have enough, and they <i>are
</i>shepherds <i>that </i>cannot understand: they all look to their own way,
every one for his gain, from his quarter.  </p>

<p>So God speaks of blind watchmen or &ldquo;dumb dogs.&rdquo;  They are &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;
in the sense that they cannot make a sound; they cannot bark.  </p>

<p>This would be like having a watchdog in a junkyard who could
not make a sound.  He would run up to the burglar, but no sound would come out
and no warning would be given to the owners of the junkyard.  </p>

<p>If you remember, we talked about spiritual blindness.  What
is spiritual blindness?  This means that you cannot understand; and God is the
One who relates this idea.  There is a blindness of the mind and a blindness of
the heart.  Spiritual blindness is a lack of understanding.  It is ignorance;
but God tells us that His people, of course, do not have this problem because
He gives them &ldquo;eyes to see.&rdquo;  He gives them understanding.  We read, &ldquo;None of
the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&rdquo;  This is because
they are blind when it comes to these things.  This is why their watchmen are
blind and cannot see the enemy.  </p>

<p>So the constant report from the watchman who is in the
church is, &ldquo;All is well; the coast is clear; there is &lsquo;peace and safety.&rsquo;&rdquo;  This
is because they cannot see the enemy and they cannot see the sword in the enemy&rsquo;s
hand.  </p>

<p>We read in Ezekiel 33 that the watchman sees the sword
coming.  Who is bearing the sword?  Who is coming?  Who is coming like an
enemy?  Who is it?  It is Christ.  It is God.  He is the One who is coming and
He is coming to kill.  </p>

<p>For instance, if we go to Mark 13:34, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>For the Son of man is </i>as a man taking a far journey, who
left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work,
and commanded the porter to watch.  </p>

<p>Jesus is the One who is setting the watch.  He is setting
the watch.  He has established the role of watchman.  </p>

<p>He continues on to say in Mark 13:35-37:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest
coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all,
Watch.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye know not when the master of the house cometh.&rdquo;  This is
why we had to watch.  It is because we did not know throughout the church age;
however, God indicated that He would open up the Scriptures at the time of the
end and that He would reveal these things.  For anyone watching in the Bible, looking
for the judgment of God as God instructed us to do, at the proper time, which
is in our day, they would see.  They would see; but if someone was never
keeping watch, they would not see.  This is why Christ instructed all to &ldquo;watch&rdquo;
for His approach.  </p>

<p>Or look at Matthew 21:37-41.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
reverence my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his
inheritance. And they caught him, and cast <i>him </i>out of the vineyard, and
slew <i>him.</i> When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those
wicked men, and will let out <i>his </i>vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
shall render him the fruits in their seasons.  </p>

<p>This is related more to the first coming of Christ, but this
is the same idea.  God is coming to bring judgment on those who are disobedient
to His Word.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 25:14-19.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is </i>as a man travelling into a
far country, <i>who </i>called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and
made <i>them </i>other five talents. And likewise he that <i>had received </i>two,
he also gained other two. But he that had received one went and digged in the
earth, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money. After a long time the lord of those servants
cometh, and reckoneth with them.  </p>

<p>It is Christ the Lord who is coming to reckon with His
servants.  God has revealed that His day of coming is May 21<sup>st</sup> of
2011.  It is next year and He is the One who is approaching.  It is He who has
the sword.  The sword is the Word of God.  It protrudes out of His mouth,
according to the book of Revelation.  It is He who is going to destroy man for
their rebelliousness against Him.  </p>

<p>Let us look at James 4 and we will see how God directly
establishes that there is warfare between Him and mankind.  We read in James
4:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">From whence <i>come </i>wars and fightings among you? <i>come
they </i>not hence, <i>even </i>of your lusts that war in your members? Ye
lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight
and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because
ye ask amiss, that ye may consume <i>it </i>upon your lusts. Ye adulterers and
adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.  </p>

<p>Here is the battle.  Here is the war.  It is the kingdom of Satan
and the kingdom of darkness against the Kingdom of Christ and the Kingdom of Light. 
Each unsaved individual is the enemy of God, and so God is coming, as He said
He would, to destroy His enemy; and yet the churches are indicating today that
there is &ldquo;peace and safety.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we go to 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then
sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and
they shall not escape.  </p>

<p>They see &ldquo;peace and safety&rdquo; because they do not see God
coming with a weapon.  They do not see the battle of Armageddon straight
ahead.  They understand that God &ldquo;hath appointed a day, in the which he will
judge the world,&rdquo; but they will not admit that we can actually know the day.  </p>

<p>Therefore, the true watchmen are sounding the trumpet to
warn the people and we are telling everyone that this is the day.  The church
is countering this and saying, &ldquo;No, no; that is not the day.  That is not the
day because nobody can know the day.&rdquo;  Therefore, God&rsquo;s people are saying, &ldquo;This
is the day of battle.  This is Armageddon.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we look at Revelation 16:14, which is speaking of false
prophets, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <i>which </i>go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the
battle of that great day of God Almighty.  </p>

<p>This is the battle.  Look at the next verse, Revelation
16:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief&hellip;  </p>

<p>So God is indicating that there is a war, it is a battle. 
Actually, it is not going to be much of a battle.  To tell you the truth, there
is not going to be much resistance coming from man towards God on that day. 
God is just too all-powerful and too almighty.  How man could ever think, in
his creature-state, that he could actually do battle with the Creator is just
part of his blindness.  It is part of his spiritual deadness that he would dare
to rebel against God.  This is what it truly is.  If we look at the whole world
and all of the things that go on in this world, it is rebellion.  </p>

<p>It is just as if there was a King of England who had his
subjects, the English people, and they all wanted to do things contrary to the
king&rsquo;s decrees.  They would be classified as rebels, because they are rebels.  </p>

<p>Of course, there have been evil kings and kings who were not
just, but God is perfect and holy and just and good and never has an
unrighteous decree.  He is the most benevolent ruler possible, the great &ldquo;King
of kings and Lord of lords,&rdquo; and everyone should desire to serve this King and
to offer up their very lives in service to the King who has died for them, the
subjects.  Yet man does not want anything to do with this kind of a king, this
type of a ruler; and so there is constant rebellion and constant revolt against
God; and God has put up with this.  </p>

<p>He likens this to Him just going away for a short period of
time.  The Son of Man is like a man who takes a journey, but He is very much
aware of what happened during His absence.  He is very much aware of what was
going on with His subjects and with those who would not have Him rule over
them.  </p>

<p>So He has set a date in which He will return, and the
graciousness and wonderful compassion of God is that He is telling these same
subjects when He is coming back in order to hold them accountable.  He is even
gracious and kind enough to offer a possibility of pardon that all of the
rebellious transgressions against this great King could potentially be
forgiven.  </p>

<p>If someone were to approach God and to humble themselves and
cry out, potentially, He might forgive and pardon.  He might not say, &ldquo;Off with
their heads!&rdquo;  When He returns, He may grant them the golden scepter.  He may
extend it so that they can have favor and grace in His sight.  </p>

<p>But the rebels want nothing to do with this.  They want
nothing to do with it.  They want to keep rebelling against God.  It is only
when this great and good God draws these rebels to Himself against their will
that any will find grace in His sight and beseech Him on terms that match the
terms that God gives in His Bible.  </p>

<p>Many people want peace.  They want peace with God, but they
want it on their terms.  They want to determine what the Gospel is.  They want
to decide how an individual can become saved and have their sins forgiven. 
This has to do with their effort and their work; but God says, &ldquo;No; those are
not the terms for peace.  Those are not the terms at all.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We hear of armies that surrender to another army.  When
there is a vastly greater power coming against them, they are in no position to
bargain.  They are in no position to say to the other army, &ldquo;Here is the terms
of our peace if we do surrender.&rdquo;  No; it has to be an unconditional surrender
or they will be destroyed, &ldquo;We will destroy you unconditionally, because we
have the power to do this.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what God says in Luke 14.  He uses this image, this
example.  We read in Luke 14:31-32:  </p>

<p class="verse">Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him
that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is yet a
great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.  </p>

<p>This is what God is saying.  Kings have commonsense.  They
have commonsense.  When they see an army approaching whom they realize their
army cannot overcome, this is when they will send some ambassadors to approach
the enemy army and try to say something like, &ldquo;We do not want this war.  What
do you want from us?  Do you want our gold?  Do you want our silver?  What do
you want?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They will try to make peace; because they realize if they do
not, it will all be taken away anyway and that they will all be dead.  Their
women and their sons and their daughters will be taken captive.  It will be a
horrible situation, and so they will think, &ldquo;Let us sue for peace.&rdquo;  This would
be a wise thing to do.  This is a wise thing to do before the enemy gets to
you.  </p>

<p>So this is an option that can be given; however, first of
all, they need to know that the enemy is approaching.  Who is going to sue for
peace if they are completely unaware of the approaching enemy?  Who is going to
do this if they are in total ignorance that the enemy army is approaching?  </p>

<p>Do you remember how the Babylonian kingdom fell?  King
Belshazzar saw the writing on the wall and Daniel was called to interpret.  </p>

<p>Let us read this in Daniel 5.  Daniel begins to interpret
the writing in verse 25.  We read in Daniel 5:25-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And this <i>is </i>the writing that was written, MENE, MENE,
TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This <i>is </i>the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances,
and art found wanting. Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
</p>

<p>Here is the judgment: &ldquo;Thy kingdom is given to the Medes and
the Persians.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Daniel 5:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
and <i>put </i>a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning
him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.  </p>

<p>If you remember, Daniel had said earlier that he did not
want these things.  He said, &ldquo;Let thy gifts be to thyself.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Daniel had some sort of advance information about this;
because as soon as he was called, as soon as he went into the palace where the
king was and this feast was going on, he was able to interpret this particular vision. 
He did this immediately and without seeking the counsel of the Lord, as he had
done previously in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar.  </p>

<p>When Nebuchadnezzar had demanded of the wise men what his
dream was and the interpretation of it, Daniel and his friends went and prayed
and sought the Lord.  They had to take some time, and then God revealed it to
them.  It was then that they went back to the king.  </p>

<p>Here, Daniel just walks in, the king tells him about the vision,
and Daniel immediately interprets the vision.  What was the interpretation?  It
was that the kingdom of Babylon, which typified the kingdom of Satan, would be
destroyed.  </p>

<p>This is the 70<sup>th</sup> year of the Babylonian
captivity, which started in 609 B.C.  It is the year 539 B.C.  It is the end of
this 70-year period, which typified the Great Tribulation; and so this is
typifying the end of the Great Tribulation and God is indicating that Daniel
had some knowledge of this, because he immediately told the king what the vision
meant.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 30, Daniel 5:30:  </p>

<p class="verse">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.  </p>

<p>He was slain in that very night.  Where were the Babylonian
watchmen?  What were they doing?  Where were they?  </p>

<p>Earlier, what were the king and all of his princes doing? 
They were having a party.  They were drinking, they were eating, and they were
using the vessels from the temple of Jehovah.  </p>

<p>Obviously, they had no forewarning.  They had no advance
information about the approaching army of the Medes and the Persians.  Nobody
sounded the trumpet.  No one blew the trumpet to warn the people.  There is no
indication of this, even though the enemy had to be close.  </p>

<p>We know that the Medes and the Persians were a mighty
empire.  Babylon was, also, before it was conquered.  Therefore, the Medes and
the Persians would not have just sent a couple of platoons against Babylon. 
They would have sent their full strength.  They would have sent a large army.  </p>

<p>How was it possible that a large army of the Medes and the
Persians apparently just walked right into Babylon and the Babylonian
leadership knew nothing about it, from the king, through the princes, and down
to all of the nobles?  How were they so ignorant of this?  </p>

<p>Even after Daniel interprets this vision and tells them that
the kingdom is divided and <span class="underline">given</span> to the Medes and the Persians, even
after he tells them specifically who is going to conquer them, even after this,
the King of Babylon, Belshazzar, is ignorant.  We can see this because he is
still trying to make Daniel the third ruler in the kingdom.  </p>

<p>What kingdom?  What future did this kingdom of Babylon
have?  It had very little.  We are not told exactly how many hours passed, but
it was &ldquo;in that night.&rdquo;  &ldquo;In that night,&rdquo; the king of the Medes and the
Persians and his army marched right into where this palace was, because they
killed King Belshazzar the same night that this vision was interpreted for
him.  </p>

<p>So where were the watchmen?  Well, historically, we do not
know.  Were they, themselves, drunk, since this seemed to be the manner of the
kings and the princes?  Were they asleep in their towers?  </p>

<p>They could have been; but, spiritually, we know that this is
a picture of the end of the Great Tribulation.  The king of the Medes and the
Persians was Darius, who was also called Cyrus.  God said of Cyrus that he was &ldquo;his
anointed&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Messiah.&rdquo;  He says of Cyrus, &ldquo;<i>He is </i>my shepherd,&rdquo;

which is Christ.  </p>

<p>Christ came in the night to the kingdom of Babylon, which
represents this world.  This is the spiritual picture here.  The kingdom of Babylon
represents the kingdom of Satan, and Christ took them all by surprise.  He
marched right in with no advance warning.  </p>

<p>Is this because we are not doing our jobs correctly?  Is
this why on May 21<sup>st</sup> that so many people are going to be destroyed
by this enemy, by God who is coming to destroy them?  Is this because the
people of the world were not warned?  </p>

<p>No, it is not because of this.  Belshazzar was warned, but
he just did not understand.  He was warned, but he did not understand; and so
are the people of today being warned.  With every way imaginable, God&rsquo;s people
are trying to warn the citizens of this world, the rebels, that the King is
coming.  He is returning!</p>

<p>So we ask, &ldquo;Are you ready?  Are you ready to meet God?&rdquo;  We
ask them if they are prepared, as the Bible says, &ldquo;to meet thy God, O Israel&rdquo;? 
This is really what is being proclaimed and said.  </p>

<p>Just look at all of the different ways in which God&rsquo;s people
are sending forth this warning.  People are wearing T-shirts.  They are putting
bumper stickers on their vehicles.  They are putting magnetic signs that they
can just put on their cars.  They are putting up political-type signs in their
yards.  </p>

<p>I saw one in Delaware the other day.  My brother was with me
in the car.  We were talking about May 21<sup>st</sup>.  He is not a believer
at this point.  We drove past a yard and there was one of those signs with the
message, &ldquo;Judgment Day! May 21, 2011.&rdquo;  I had an opportunity to point this sign
out to him.  These signs are very good.  </p>

<p>By the way, I have put one of these in my own front yard.  I
am on sign number four now because the first three were taken over the last
couple of weeks.  I put one sign out in my yard and it stayed there all
throughout the day and night, but I came outside one morning to find it gone. 
If you buy any of these signs, try to buy several of them.  </p>

<p>After the first sign was taken, I had to wait for the second
sign to come in.  I put this sign out, but this sign was taken in the middle of
the night.  So I put out a third sign.  This time, we started taking the sign
in at night.  We decided not to leave it out all night.  Then this sign had to
have been taken between 6:00 and 8:00 P.M. because I had seen it at 6:00 P.M.  I came out at 8:00 P.M. and it was gone.  </p>

<p>I think it is an adult, because a kid would have just ripped
it up or destroyed it; but I have no idea where these signs have gone.  I have
to admit that I got a little mad because I started thinking about my First
Amendment rights and all of this kind of stuff.  After this, I thought I would
get a half dozen signs and just put them up all over the place, with the idea
that if they take one, I&rsquo;ll put up two more.  However, I realized that this was
a sort of striving.  Even in this, we do not want to strive.  </p>

<p>So this is bothering people.  They are very disturbed by
this information that they are seeing on trucks, etc.  A little bumper sticker
might bother them a little.  A big sign on an R.V. will bother them a lot. 
This is because this information is very disturbing to them.  </p>

<p>I have even thought that there might be someone in my
neighborhood who is thinking, &ldquo;You know, I do not want to see that sign up.  I
do not like it and the children might see it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Have you ever handed out tracts and given one to a child
when someone who is not even the parent starts yelling at you because you gave
a tract to a child?  They are going to come under judgment just like the
adults.  My feeling about this is that they also should be handed a tract, but
there is this sense of protectiveness.  However, in actuality, I do not think
that this is what is involved.  </p>

<p>People say that they do not want their children to see a
sign like this because it might hurt their psyche or make them fearful.  But is
this a valid concern for today&rsquo;s children?  Today&rsquo;s children watch horror shows
where people are being cut up.  People say that they are afraid that this might
frighten their children.  Yet do they not put up witches and ghosts and
vampires and all of these things designed to scare people?  </p>

<p>This is just an excuse, and so do not try to use the
children.  It is the individual who does not like this information.  I do not
like signs either sometimes.  People sometimes put up things in their yard that
I might not like, but I have never thought of going into their yard and taking
it away.  </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is that this is due to one of
two things.  The first reason could be because they do not believe this and they
think that this is a lie.  If this is true, how can it hurt anyone?  If they
think that this was a lie, why would they even be disturbed by this?  If they
think that this is a lie, why would it bother them at all?  </p>

<p>The other reason is because there is the knowledge of
judgment that God has placed within man.  We know that we are a creature.  We
know that He is God.  We know that we are accountable.  It is disturbing on
this level because there is truth involved in this.  If this is the reason, then
why would they not want people to hear the truth?  This does not make sense
either way.  </p>

<p>So God is moving His people to get the message out and to
sound the trumpet.  I have done very little in comparison to many people,
especially in the area of advertising.  People have hats and all kinds of
things.  They are wearing hoodies and jackets, all kinds of things with this
information on them, and it is all trying to get someone&rsquo;s attention.  </p>

<p>We are trying to get bolder in this, but are we doing these
things because we are just losing it?  Or are we trying to do more and more
because people are not hearing the sound of the trumpet?  It is because they
are not hearing it.  They are not hearing the warning cry.  They are not
responding.  </p>

<p>It is kind of like you give a blow on the trumpet.  However,
when you look around, the people are still living like normal.  Then you try to
sound it a little louder, and yet the people continue on as normal.  </p>

<p>All of this advertising of the date is a testimony to the
deafness and to the blindness and to the spiritual deadness of the world around
us.  There is a spiritual deadness that forces God&rsquo;s people, out of love, to do
whatever they can to blow the trumpet and to warn the people so that, perchance,
they might notice an R.V.  Just maybe someone will notice an R.V., which
happens to be worth a lot of money, that someone took the time to wrap or to
letter.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people are doing many things in many ways.  A lot of money
is being spent on a very short-term goal, which is to warn the people about May
21.  No one is asking for money in return.  It is just to warn the people, to
let them know that they may not be seeing this; but God&rsquo;s people see this.  According
to the Bible, the child of God has eyes &ldquo;in his head,&rdquo; because God gives them a
heart of discernment to discern &ldquo;time and judgment.&rdquo;  He just simply has
revealed this information to them and they see the sword coming.  </p>

<p>Even if your church does not, even if your pastor and your
elder and your deacon keep telling you that the coast is clear and that you are
not to sound this trumpet, God has told us what He thinks of them.  They are
blind watchmen.  They are like &ldquo;dumb dogs&rdquo; that cannot bark.  Do not trust
them.  Do not trust us either.  Trust the Bible, because this is all coming
from the Bible.  This is why we can be certain that this is going to happen and
that this is going to happen very shortly.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to 1 Thessalonians 5.  We read again in 1
Thessalonians 5:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>We know that this is referring to Christ coming upon the
unsaved, because they cannot see His coming.  They cannot receive the warning. 
They will not respond by going to God; and so they are surprised; just like Belshazzar
and the Babylonians must have been surprised when the Medes and the Persians
just marched right in.  </p>

<p>Then we read again in 1 Thessalonians 5:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
shall not escape.  </p>

<p>We have mentioned this before, but people have this so
engrained in their minds.  They know that Christ is coming &ldquo;as a thief&rdquo; because
the Bible says this, and so they think that He is coming &ldquo;as a thief&rdquo; even for
His people; but no, this is not possible.  This is not possible because a
thief, according to John 10:10, &ldquo;cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and
to destroy.&rdquo;  It is negative, negative, negative.  It is all bad.  </p>

<p>If a thief broke into your house, would there be anything
good in relation to this?  Except for the fact that &ldquo;all things work together
for good&rdquo; for the child of God, there would be nothing positive about this. 
The thief came.  He broke a window.  He came in.  He took your valuables. 
Maybe even in some cases, if he runs into someone within the house, he can kill
someone.  </p>

<p>So there is nothing good about a thief breaking into your
home.  It is all bad; and there is nothing good if Christ comes for you &ldquo;as a
thief.&rdquo;  If you are caught off-guard, if you are unaware that He is coming, and
if you insist &ldquo;of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>,&rdquo; then you are saying
that He is coming for you personally &ldquo;as a thief.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Without knowing it, you are saying that you are under the
judgment of God and that He is coming to kill you and to steal your treasure,
because your treasure should have been in heaven &ldquo;where thieves do not break
through nor steal.&rdquo;  However, obviously, your treasure was on earth.  It was on
earth.  You treasured up things on earth.  You are an unsaved individual and Christ
has come to steal everything, to take it all away.  </p>

<p>Notice that 1 Thessalonians 5:3 speaks of &ldquo;sudden
destruction.&rdquo;  How does this fit with so many warnings being given?  How could
people be suddenly destroyed?  </p>

<p>Look at Proverbs 29:1.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of &ldquo;sudden destruction,&rdquo; but notice how odd
this is.  It is referring to people who are being &ldquo;often reproved.&rdquo;  What is a
reproof?  </p>

<p>We read in 2 Timothy 3:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">All scripture <i>is </i>given by inspiration of God, and <i>is </i>profitable
for doctrine, for reproof&hellip;  </p>

<p>Scripture is given &ldquo;for reproof.&rdquo;  When we read things in
the Bible where God tells us what pleases Him and what displeases Him and we
still do what displeases Him, then God&rsquo;s Word has reproved us.  He has reproved
us, and God reproves us all of the time.  </p>

<p>Likewise, God, out of His wonderful kindness and love, is
revealing to the whole world that Judgment Day is May 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011. 
We are hearing it and hearing it.  Children, are you hearing this?  Yes, again
and again and again; but notice what Proverbs 29:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is being &ldquo;often reproved&rdquo; and he &ldquo;hardeneth <i>his</i>

neck.&rdquo;  This means that he becomes stubborn.  He does not like it and he has no
intention of listening to what God is saying.  </p>

<p>So when we hear about May 21, 2011, what is it that we should do?  What response does God want?  </p>

<p>God would have us respond like the Ninevites and go to Him
in &ldquo;sackcloth and ashes&rdquo; and &ldquo;fasting.&rdquo;  We need to beseech Him and cry
mightily to Him that He might turn from the evil that is intended upon us.  </p>

<p>What this means is that this information should interrupt
our lives.  We should not be living life as normal.  We should not be looking
ahead to school or to a career or to marriage and a family.  </p>

<p>This should interrupt our lives like the message from Jonah
when he came to Nineveh and cried, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.&rdquo;  They stopped what they were doing.  They were people, just like
we are.  They had a lot going on in their lives, just like everyone else, and
yet they sat in &ldquo;sackcloth and ashes.&rdquo;  They stopped the presses.  They stopped
the work.  They stopped everything, because this became the most important
thing to them.  God gave them &ldquo;eyes to see.&rdquo;  He gave them an understanding
heart and the knowledge that He would do what He had said He would do.  </p>

<p>Yet, today, people are hearing these things, but they are
not changing the course of their lives.  They are continuing on with their plans
or with the way in which they have been living.  The evil is still in their
hands.  The violence is still in their hands.  The transgressions are still
ongoing.  They are still disobeying this God who is returning to reckon with
all of His servants.  He is coming to destroy them.  They are hearing this, and
yet they are hardening their necks and they are not listening.  They are
hearing &ldquo;the sound of the trumpet,&rdquo; like it says in Jeremiah 6, and they are
saying, &ldquo;We will not hearken.&rdquo;  They are saying, &ldquo;We will not listen!  We will
not obey!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed&hellip;  </p>

<p>He says &ldquo;suddenly,&rdquo; as if by surprise, even though they
heard it and they heard it and they heard it; but, again, they never took this
seriously or they dismissed this.  Whatever method they used, they did not
listen to what God was saying.  </p>

<p>So God says, &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; but this is going to be the case for
the entire world.  As this verse ends, this will be:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;without remedy.  </p>

<p>There will be no salvation for them, no deliverance, no
mercy.  Starting on May 21<sup>st</sup> for that five-month period, it will be
nothing but judgment, judgment.  God will have &ldquo;judgment without mercy.&rdquo;  There
will be no more &ldquo;remedy.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now is the time for salvation.  This is what the Bible tells
us, and God is blowing the trumpet to warn the people, &ldquo;Take warning!  Take
warning!  Listen to the sound of the trumpet.  Hearken!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, we could pray that He would have mercy on us if we
realize that the enemy is right at the gate, and He is right at the door.  The
Bible tells us, &ldquo;The judge standeth before the door,&rdquo; and He is ready to come
in.  The time is very short until that day.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
