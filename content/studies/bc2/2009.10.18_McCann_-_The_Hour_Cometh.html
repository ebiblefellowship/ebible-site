<p>If everyone can turn to John 16 that we began to read last week,
I am going to read the first 15 verses.  John 16:1-15 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that
whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things
will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. But
these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember
that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning,
because I was with you. But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of
you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is
expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not
come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come,
he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of
sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to my
Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is
judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit
when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he
shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that </i>shall he
speak: and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall show <i>it </i>unto you. All things that the Father
hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show <i>it
</i>unto you.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>Some of you were here last week.  You probably remember this
chapter as we went over the first verse or two last week.  These verses brought
us to other passages in the Bible and we were seeing how they related to John
16.  I will just kind of do a quick summary.</p>

<p>If you remember, John 16:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended.  </p>

<p>Of course, we know that the Bible is an offense.  The Bible
is very much an offense to the people of the world.  The teaching that is
derived from the Bible can be an offense to the people of the world.  For
instance, May 21, 2011 comes completely from the Bible.  It is based on
Biblical evidence; and yet when some people hear about this, they do not like
it at all and can get very upset.  </p>

<p>Someone from our fellowship has a wrap on his truck with the
May 21 Judgment Day information on it.  It is a beautiful truck and it really
stands out wherever he goes.  He travels around and people see the date, so
they see this information as well as a few Bible verses.  They see that this
date is Judgment Day.  He was just sharing with me a couple of incidents where
people were very offended that this information was so prominently and boldly
displayed for anybody to see.  </p>

<p>They did not like it at all, and we know why.  We know why. 
Actually, it could be anything.  It could be a T-shirt with a Bible verse on
it; this is offensive to some people.  This is because Christ&rsquo;s Word, the
Bible, is an offense.  Jesus Himself is that offense that many people just
cannot get over.  He is the stumblingblock.  The Word of God is a
stumblingblock to many, many people.  </p>

<p>But Jesus said that He spoke these things &ldquo;<b>that ye should
not be offended</b>,&rdquo; which is referring to His elect people.  God&rsquo;s people, of
course, are not offended by the Bible or the Word of God.  We love the Bible
and we trust the Bible.  It is not an offense for us to proclaim the Bible,
because this is what Jesus would have us to do.  </p>

<p>When He says, &ldquo;<b>These things have I spoken unto you</b>,&rdquo;
we really have to understand that this is referring to the whole Bible.  He is
the Word who was made flesh.  The whole Bible is what Christ has spoken to us. 
Even though it is true that historically Jesus spoke specifically to His disciples
and to the apostles, this is actually a reference to the whole Word of God.  </p>

<p>What we read in verse 2 naturally follows verse 1.  In verse
1, He is implying that people will be offended by the things that He has
spoken.  Then John 16:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the <span class="underline">time</span>
cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  </p>

<p>We have to make one correction here in this passage where we
read the word &ldquo;time.&rdquo;  This is the Greek word <i>hora</i>.  What does that
sound like, <i>hora</i>?  It sounds like &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  It is very close to our
English word for &ldquo;hour,&rdquo; and this is what the word means.  Most often it is
translated as &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  It is also sometimes translated as &ldquo;time.&rdquo;  In one case,
it is translated as &ldquo;instant.&rdquo;  This is in Luke 2 when Anna came into the
temple.  It says that she was &ldquo;<b>coming in that <span class="underline">instant</span></b>&rdquo; and it is
the same word for &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So it is the same word where Jesus is saying in John 16:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the [<i>hour</i>]
cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  </p>

<p>We read about being put out of the synagogue in two other
places in John.  One other place is in John 9.  John 9 is the chapter that
deals with the healing of the blind man who was born blind.  He could never see
and Jesus healed him, which was an offence to the Pharisees, to the spiritual
leaders of Israel.  They abhorred Christ and what He was doing because He was
taking away their power and their authority and contradicting their teachings
and their doctrines.  They did not appreciate Him at all and they did not want
to see any good thing attributed to Jesus.  </p>

<p>So they called the blind man to their council where they
interrogated him as if he had committed a crime.  They tried to find out
whether or not he truly was a blind man and, if so, how he got healed, and so
they called the blind man&rsquo;s parents.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 9:19-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
born blind? how then doth he now see? His parents answered them and said, We
know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: But by what means he now
seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask
him: he shall speak for himself. These <i>words </i>spake his parents, because
they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did
confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  </p>

<p>That was a big threat.  That was a very big threat.  </p>

<p>When we read Israel&rsquo;s history, we find out how God had
commanded at times that if an individual were not circumcised, he was to be cut
off from his people&mdash;not put to death, just cut off.  He was to be removed,
separated.  He would be an outcast of Israel.  Many others were, too, who were
ceremonially unclean.  They were put outside the camp because they had this
uncleanness.  The Word of God actually commanded this to be done, which God did
in order to teach us about the filthiness of sin and how unclean we are because
of our sin.  </p>

<p>But this was a horrible thing and a terrible threat to
somebody to say, &ldquo;You will be put out of the synagogue,&rdquo; because keep in mind
that Israel was the corporate body.  It was not like the churches.  If you are
put out of one church, you can go to another church, as there are so many churches
today.  But Israel was the only nation who was outwardly identified with God
and His kingdom; therefore, where could somebody go if they were put out of the
synagogue?  Could they go to Damascus?  Could they go to Babylon?  </p>

<p>The whole world was heathen, so to be put outside of Israel
was a frightful thing for the Jews because they associated that with not being
saved.  After all, of course the holy people were the Jewish people.  They
believed that God was working through the Jewish nation; so if they were thrust
out, we can see how they would really fear that.  </p>

<p>But, of course, this was not true.  This was not true
because God has saved individuals outside of Israel all throughout history. 
Jesus actually went out of His way to explain that there were many widows in Israel
whom God did not take care of.  Instead, He took care of a widow from another
nation.  There were also many lepers in Israel, but God did not cleanse them. 
He cleansed Naaman the Syrian.  </p>

<p>The Jews were very upset when Christ told them these things,
but yet these were the leaders of Israel.  These were the teachers of the Law
of God and they taught the people, &ldquo;This is where you must remain in order to
be saved, right here.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Basically, what they were saying was, &ldquo;If we put you out, if
you are kicked out of the congregation of Israel, spiritually speaking, that is
as good as signing your death warrant.  You are killed.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is why in John 16, God associates being put out of the
synagogues with killing, as it says in the second part of John 16:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  </p>

<p>So the parents of the blind man were fearful.  They told the
truth, &ldquo;Yes, he was born blind,&rdquo; but they did not want to go any further than
that.  But this was their own son&mdash;their own son!  They did not want to support
and stand up for their own son because they feared being cast out of the church
of their day.  </p>

<p>We see this same thing in John 12:42 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him&hellip;  </p>

<p>Did you know this about the chief rulers and the authorities
who were constantly tempting Christ and constantly trying to find fault with
what He was saying?  <span class="underline">Many</span> of them believed.  These were the same people
who later would deliver Him over into the hands of Pilate where He would be
crucified and killed for being a false teacher who claimed that He was God.  The
Jews said, &ldquo;<b>By our law he ought to die</b>,&rdquo; and yet many of these people
thought, &ldquo;Well, this man has to be from God.&rdquo;  It says, &ldquo;<b>many believed on
him</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at what Nicodemus said in John 3:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles
that thou doest, except God be with him.  </p>

<p>He did not say, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;<b>We know</b>.&rdquo;  They
had conversations amongst themselves, whispered conversations, not out loud&mdash;but
they did have conversations.  &ldquo;You know, I heard that He healed the blind.  He
gave the deaf ears.  He raised the dead.  He gave the lame man legs to walk. 
How could he do those things?  How is that possible?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So the scribes and Pharisees who came from Jerusalem came up
with an official line in Mark 3 and said, &ldquo;<b>He hath Beelzebub, and by the
prince of the devils casteth he out devils</b>.&rdquo;  This is what they would
officially say; however, even amongst the rulers of the Jews, they knew.  They
had never seen anybody do these things before.  </p>

<p>We have charlatans today who claim to do these things, but
they do not actually do them.  Nobody who is blind is seeing or who is deaf is
hearing today.  Nobody is made whole of a withered hand today.  This just is
not happening because Satan does not have this kind of power.  Even though the
church world today is under his control, the only thing that he can do is to
cause people to perhaps fall over backwards, which is not hardly anything&mdash;is it? 
What is falling over backwards compared to saying &ldquo;<b>rise up and walk</b>&rdquo; to
a man who had never walked?  There is no comparison.  </p>

<p>The rulers of the Jews who knew something of the Scriptures
realized, &ldquo;Someone cannot do these things unless they are from God; however,
there is a problem because we cannot say this out loud.&rdquo;  So Nicodemus had to
come by night.  </p>

<p>Again, John 12:42:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him, </i>lest they should
be put out of the synagogue:  </p>

<p>We see the same thing, the same fear.  It was very
spiritually dangerous for them to say anything out loud because then they were
going to be identified as one of His disciples and out they would go.  </p>

<p>It was too bad that they feared this from the Jews, but can
we relate this in any way to our day?  Can we relate this?  What do the
synagogues represent if not the churches and congregations?  </p>

<p>There are people in the churches and congregations who are
very familiar with a ministry like Family Radio.  They are very familiar with
the fact that Family Radio is listener supported, that they do not sell
advertising time, that they are not trying to make any money, that the board of
directors of Family Radio are all volunteers.  Well, actually, I do not know
this for sure, but I do know that Mr. Camping is a volunteer and that Family
Radio has been around for 50 years without advertising.  </p>

<p>Is this not incredible?  Can you think of anything that can
survive for this length of time without trying to make some kind of money to
support itself?  How is it possible that Family Radio can be listener supported
when so many of the listeners seem to be against what they are hearing on
Family Radio?  </p>

<p>You can hear the people who listen and call into the &ldquo;Open
Forum&rdquo; and say, &ldquo;You said this&rdquo; or &ldquo;You are teaching the end of the church age
and that is a lie.&rdquo;  Again and again and again, many of the listeners are
contrary to the truths that are coming from Family Radio.  </p>

<p>So how does this work?  How does it happen that the Bible is
such an offence?  </p>

<p>It is because at this time we are learning from the Bible
that the church age is over, and this is being proclaimed faithfully to people
who are in the churches.  The doctrines that we came to know were in error are
now being corrected.  </p>

<p>In each case, many are offended.  Many are offended that
there is no place called &ldquo;hell&rdquo; where forever and ever individuals who were
unsaved would be tortured eternally, and yet the ministry of Family Radio
continues.  Doctrine after doctrine offends this one or offends that one, and
yet Family Radio continues to be broadcast.  It continues to go out into all the
world, and yet it has no way of making money other than maybe a few poor widows
and their &ldquo;<b>two mites</b>&rdquo; who are understanding that these doctrines are
from the Bible.  They want to support it and so they send their money&mdash;this one
here and that one there.  </p>

<p>But how can you count on that?  How can you depend on that
for even a year?  But then 50 years?  </p>

<p>People know.  The people in the churches know, &ldquo;This is from
God.  It is God who is behind the scenes and who established the ministry of
Family Radio.&rdquo;  There is no other explanation.  </p>

<p>The churches even have cookie drives or they try to sell
something just to support the financial backing of an individual church because
they have expenses.  They do not even rely on the members of their congregation
in many cases to provide for their own church.  They have to do additional
things&mdash;but not Family Radio&mdash;and yet why will not some who really know the
history of the teaching of Family Radio, that it is only the Bible and nothing
else, why will they not say, &ldquo;Well, you know what?  I see what is being said. 
The church age is over, so I am going to step down.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If a pastor were to do this, for one, they would be targeted
by the denomination and other churches and they would be badly spoken of. 
Also, the church is their livelihood.  They are getting their money and support
through the church.  </p>

<p>So this is not an easy thing.  I think that the people who
are in the churches are in much the same position as many of those in Israel
who just did not want to be put out of the synagogue, because they are afraid, &ldquo;Maybe
there is no salvation outside of the church.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Well, yes, there is.  This is the only place where there is
salvation.  There is no longer any salvation within the churches, within the
congregations.  </p>

<p>It goes on in John 16:3 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.  </p>

<p>The Jews would say, &ldquo;God is our Father&rdquo; or &ldquo;Abraham is our
father; we are of God.  We know God.  We know the Savior.  We know that He is
Jehovah; of course we know who God is.&rdquo;  But Jesus is saying, &ldquo;No, you do not.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>They did not know their God.  They did not know the Father,
because they did not understand that Christ was God in the flesh.  He was standing
right before them and they did not realize this.  </p>

<p>In John 8:53-55, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? Jesus answered, If I honour
myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye
say, that he is your God: Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I
should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him,
and keep his saying.  </p>

<p>Christ spoke very directly to them, which is another reason
as to why the Bible is an offense.  He spoke very directly.  </p>

<p>God does not hold back the punches.  He knows our hearts. 
He knows the truth apart from all of the outward trappings that go on in the
church or did go on in the nation of Israel.  </p>

<p>Christ was saying, &ldquo;You do not know God!  You do not know
Him.  You never have known Him.  I and the Father are One.  Here I am, right in
the midst of you, and you do not recognize it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the same problem today.  On the last day when many
are crying out, &ldquo;<b>Lord, Lord, have we not&hellip;in Thy name done many wonderful
works</b>,&rdquo; Jesus is going to proclaim, &ldquo;<b>I never knew you</b>.&rdquo;  This is
because they did not really know God.  The only way that we can know God is if
He first knows us or saves us.  God will tell people on May 21 by the act of
the earthquake and the Rapture and the taking up of His elect into Heaven, &ldquo;<b>I
never knew you</b>,&rdquo; and it will be shown that they never knew God either. 
They did not know the Father.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 16:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But these things have I told you, that when the time [<i>hour</i>]
shall come&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is that same Greek word <i>hora</i> where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the <span class="underline">time</span> shall come&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is actually better translated &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  It helps a lot
when this is translated as &ldquo;hour,&rdquo; because look at Revelation 14:7 where it
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  </p>

<p>This is &ldquo;<b>the hour of his judgment</b>&rdquo; that we are in
right now.  It is the hour of testing.  It is the hour of judgment on the
churches and congregations.  Now is that hour.  </p>

<p>Revelation 8:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
heaven about the space of half an hour.  </p>

<p>This identifies with the first 2300 days of the Great Tribulation&mdash;May
1988 till September 1994.  This is the hour that we are in.  This is the last
hour according to the parable of the workers being sent into the vineyard.  If
you remember, some were sent in at the third hour, some at the sixth hour, some
at the ninth hour, but there were still some standing idly around at the
eleventh hour.  At the eleventh hour, God hires them and sends them into His
vineyard just for one hour.  This language is based on the Jewish day which was
considered to be twelve hours.  Jesus had said, &ldquo;<b>Are there not twelve hours
in the day</b>?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So at the eleventh hour, those workers were sent into the
vineyard for one hour.  Then the workday was over and it was time for them to
receive their payment.  They then received just as much as some who had labored
for several hours, causing some of them to feel that it was not fair and that
they did not get paid correctly.  &ldquo;Why should I get a penny when I worked so
many hours?  They only worked the last hour and they also get a penny!&rdquo;  The
answer was, &ldquo;Is it not just for the goodman of the house (which is really
referring to God) to do with His money what He would do with it?  He made a
deal with them for a penny a day and He stuck to the deal.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This parable is teaching us that everyone who receives the
gift of God&rsquo;s salvation gets the same reward, which is eternal life.  Everyone
is equal.  No one gets more than another.  It is equal portions.  This is the
inheritance for all of God&rsquo;s people for eternity future, &ldquo;Here you are; here
you are.  Is eternal life not enough?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is more than sufficient.  It is abundantly more than anybody
could ever imagine.  We can only think about this a little bit before we get a
headache!  Our minds are so small and tiny.  We cannot imagine living forever
and ever and ever into the eternal future and there never being an end.  No old
age.  No death that comes.  No illness.  It is perfect life forevermore, and it
is for those of us who have maybe been a Christian for 30-40 years, and it is
for someone like the thief on the cross who was saved in the last few moments
of his life, or it is like someone in the world today who is going to be saved
on May 20<sup>th</sup> in 2011.  They will only be a child of God in this world
for a very brief period of time, yet God will say, &ldquo;Here you are.  Here is the
crown of salvation, which is eternal life.&rdquo;  It is the same for each one of
us.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Revelation 17.  We are still looking at
this word &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  It says in Revelation 17:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 
</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beast&rdquo; is Satan&rsquo;s name for what period of time?  The
Great Tribulation.  He is Satan.  He is the devil.  He is the adversary.  He is
the serpent.  Satan has many names and all of them could apply to him at any
point in history, but only &ldquo;the beast&rdquo; can be applied to Satan for the Great
Tribulation.  He is &ldquo;the beast&rdquo; in Revelation 13 who comes up out of the sea.  </p>

<p>So when we check out this verse, we know that this has to be
that period of time when Satan is loosed right at the end of the world.  God,
again, is referring to this as an hour, an hour; one hour is all that it is
going to be&mdash;it is short.  God speaks of it only as one hour (which is actually
a period of 23 years), and what is 23 years?  That is hardly anything.  What do
we have left&mdash;19 months?  What is 19 months?  I do not think that we are down to
18 yet.  We have about 19 months and a couple of days, which is a very brief
time.  </p>

<p>This is a very short period of time for anyone, is it not? 
For someone who is a child of God and who is afflicted in some way&mdash;like a wife
who is in a home with a brute of a husband who really has to pray throughout
the day just to get through the day&mdash;is it not a great blessing that she can
think, &ldquo;You know, time is short.  This is only a momentary affliction, which it
has always been, but now there is an end in sight.  I will receive that crown
of glory in a short period of time&rdquo;?  Or if someone has a physical affliction
and is infirmed and there is pain associated with the affliction or the
disease, &ldquo;Well, I have a short period of time.&rdquo;  Whatever it is in our life,
knowing the time, discerning time and judgment, helps us and is a comfort to
God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that not everyone has the best circumstances
like maybe some of us have here.  There are people in very impoverished
countries, like India or Africa or China, who can be experiencing great trouble
in their lives.  Maybe they are often hungry and they do not have some of their
necessities met at times, and yet it is a comfort.  It is a comfort for all of
God&rsquo;s people to know that our days are numbered and that they are very short.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Mark 13 and begin reading in verse 9.  Before I
begin reading, Mark 13 is a chapter dealing with what?  It is dealing with the
end of time because the disciples asked Jesus, &ldquo;<b>What <i>shall be </i>the
sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world</b>?&rdquo;  This is found in Matthew
24, and Mark 13 is a parallel chapter.  It says in Mark 13:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is not talking about Jewish synagogues.  This is
referring to the churches because this is dealing with the end of time.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and
kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. And the gospel must first be
published among all nations. But when they shall lead <i>you, </i>and deliver
you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for
it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>This is &ldquo;<b>that hour</b>,&rdquo; the hour of judgment.  </p>

<p>God said to past generations, &ldquo;<b>Neither do ye premeditate</b>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<b>take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you know how unusual that was?  How out of character, how
out of the ordinary writings of Scripture that was?  </p>

<p>That stood out like a sore thumb because the Bible says, &ldquo;<b>Meditate
upon these things</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b><i>be </i>ready always to <i>give </i>an answer
to every man that asketh you</b>.&rdquo;  Being prepared is what the Bible would have
us do.  It tells us, &ldquo;<b>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman
that needeth not to be ashamed</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>He tells us to study the Bible and to learn the Bible and to
meditate upon the Bible, and now all of a sudden in this verse we read, &ldquo;<b>Neither
do ye premeditate</b>&rdquo;; &ldquo;<b>take no thought</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What is the answer?  The answer is that God sealed up the
Word till the time of the end.  </p>

<p>Theologians of the past like Calvin, like Knox&mdash;I repeat the
same names all the time&mdash;like Luther, the great men of the Reformation, or go
back even further to anybody whom you can think of in church history who apparently
was a true child of God, and you will see that, yes, they did take thought. 
They did meditate upon Matthew 24.  They did try to understand the book of
Revelation, but it was a waste of time.  It was a waste of time because they
did not get it correct.  Not one of them.  </p>

<p>It is not pre-mill.  It is not post-mill.  It is not
a-mill.  It is what God will tell us it is &ldquo;<b>in that hour</b>,&rdquo; and we have
learned what it is.  It is the end of the church age.  It is Judgment Day on May 21, 2011.  It is a five-month period of torment on earth, and then it is the end of the
world on October 21, 2011.  And this scenario does not fit with anything in
previous history.  </p>

<p>I do not think that anyone was even close.  They maybe had
an element or two; but for the most part, they did not know and they wasted
their time writing commentaries on the whole Bible.  </p>

<p>Right there, they had a difficult task to get this right. 
They were going to write on the whole Bible and they were going to explain
everything?  That is very tough to do.  </p>

<p>So Jesus was saying, &ldquo;Do not bother.&rdquo;  If this had been
listened to, it would have been a blessing and it would have saved people a lot
of time and effort, &ldquo;Do not bother to think about what you will say.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Mark 13:11 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye:
for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>It is God who is speaking.  </p>

<p>If we go to Hebrews 1, it is interesting how the Lord breaks
down His revelation.  It says in Hebrews 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets,  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Old Testament and it is saying that
God spoke that.  </p>

<p>Then Hebrews 1:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by <i>his </i>Son&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the New Testament.  </p>

<p>Even though it is true that &ldquo;<b>holy men of God spake <i>as
they were </i>moved by the Holy Ghost</b>,&rdquo; we cannot really separate the
Persons of the Trinity.  God is One God but three Persons, and so the Holy
Spirit was involved with the prophets of the Old Testament speaking and the
Holy Spirit was involved with the New Testament individuals who were moved to
write and bring revelation.  However, here in these verses, God is saying that
the Father gave the Old Testament Scripture, Christ gave the New Testament, but
there is more to come.  </p>

<p>Not here, but later on in Hebrews God found &ldquo;<b>fault with
them</b>&rdquo;: the first covenant and the second covenant.  The fault was that they
were still too mysterious for those of us who have such thick heads&mdash;my hand is
up&mdash;for those of us who have such thick heads that we just cannot see it or
understand it, and also because God sealed it up and made it impossible to
understand.  </p>

<p>God developed the third method, which is finishing the
covenant or completing the covenant.  God spoke &ldquo;<b>by the prophets</b>,&rdquo; Christ
spoke &ldquo;<b>in the last days</b>,&rdquo; and in the completion of the covenant period
of time, &ldquo;<b>in that hour</b>,&rdquo; the Holy Ghost speaks.  It is He who now takes
center stage.  </p>

<p>Go to Habakkuk 2.  It says in Habakkuk 2:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it
</i>plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision <i>is </i>yet
for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it
tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.  </p>

<p>What is it?  What is it?  Personal pronouns in English can
be translated &ldquo;he,&rdquo; &ldquo;she,&rdquo; or &ldquo;it,&rdquo; depending upon the context.  Here the
translators did not know what God was saying, because this should not be &ldquo;it.&rdquo; 
In every instance, it should be &ldquo;he&rdquo;; &ldquo;<b>[<i>he</i>] will surely come</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Hebrews 10 where we find a quote from Habakkuk.  This
may not be an exact quote, but it is definitely referring back to Habakkuk 2. 
Hebrews 10:37-38 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>If we go to the next verse in Habakkuk 2, Habakkuk 2:4, it
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but the just shall live by <span class="underline">his</span> faith.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that in Hebrews it leaves out the word &ldquo;his&rdquo;
in the phrase &ldquo;<b>the just shall live by faith</b>&rdquo; in order for people to
think that it is their faith when it is not&mdash;it is Christ&rsquo;s faith&mdash;but it does
add the correct pronoun &ldquo;he&rdquo;; &ldquo;<b><span class="underline">he</span> that shall come will come</b>.&rdquo;  In
Habakkuk in the Old Testament, it reverses it and gives us the word &ldquo;his&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<b>the
just shall live by <span class="underline">his</span> faith</b>&rdquo;&mdash;where Hebrews 10 does not, but
Habakkuk uses the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;he.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So let me read Habakkuk 2:3 with the correct personal
pronoun:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the vision <i>is </i>yet for an appointed time, but at the
end [<i>he</i>] shall speak, and not lie: though [<i>he</i>] tarry, wait for [<i>him</i>];
because [<i>he</i>] will surely come, [<i>he</i>] will not tarry.  </p>

<p>You see, the Holy Ghost speaketh &ldquo;<b>in that hour</b>,&rdquo; and
Habakkuk is saying, &ldquo;<b>at the end [<i>he</i>] shall speak</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Will it be another book added after Revelation, book #67? 
No, it is not going to be #67 because God completed the Bible.  There are 66
books and He is not going to add to this or subtract from it.  We have the
whole Bible.  He is only going to finish it.  He is going to complete it by
giving us more information that will help us to understand many things in the
Bible&mdash;all kinds of things that we never really understood before, even though
we might have thought that we did.  We are in &ldquo;<b>that hour</b>.&rdquo;  It is now
that this is taking place.  </p>

<p>Let me also go to a couple of other verses.  If you look at
the context of Matthew 10 from verse 17, you will see that it relates to Mark
13 and Matthew 24; but then it says in Matthew 10:19-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For
it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. And
the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child:
and the children shall rise up against <i>their </i>parents, and cause them to
be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all <i>men </i>for my name&rsquo;s sake:
but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 10:25, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how
much more <i>shall they call </i>them of his household?  </p>

<p>Christ was called names.  It was said that He was of Satan. 
We will likewise be called names because we are in His stead.  If people want
to rail on us or to speak evil of us, &ldquo;<b>how much more</b>&rdquo; on us, because we
are nothing?  This is what Jesus is saying.  How much more will His people be
spoken evilly of?  Again, this is in the context of &ldquo;<b>that hour</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look also at Luke 12:8-12 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember what we read earlier about being put out of the
synagogue and the fear that the leaders of Israel had.  They did not confess
Him.  They believed, but they did not confess Him.  This is really related to
standing up for Jesus, as that hymn says:  <i>Stand up!  Stand up for Jesus!</i> 
In the eyes of the world, as we share the Gospel with the people of the world,
we are to stand up for Jesus.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man
also confess before the angels of God: But he that denieth me before men shall
be denied before the angels of God. And whosoever shall speak a word against
the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the
synagogues, and <i>unto </i>magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or
what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall
teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.  </p>

<p>Do you see the context?  It is in the context of what that
we find this verse?  </p>

<p>It is in the context of blaspheming the Holy Ghost, the Holy
Ghost who is speaking in this hour.  &ldquo;<b>In that hour</b>,&rdquo; the Holy Ghost
speaketh.  </p>

<p>This is God completing His salvation plan.  These few verses
fit perfectly in with Matthew 24 and Mark 13, and it mentions blaspheming the
Holy Ghost, just like Matthew 10 also mentioned it in a context that fits right
in with Matthew 24.  </p>

<p>So what is God saying?  Well, I think that we can understand
what He is telling us.  He is speaking of &ldquo;<b>that hour</b>&rdquo; as the time when
He is going to begin to open up the Scriptures to the understanding of His
people, and it is as though it is a new Book.  It is as if it is a new Bible.  </p>

<p>But we are reading this information in the Bible only. 
Nothing is being added to it.  It was always there.  It was always there, and
this is why John 16:12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.  </p>

<p>It was not for the church age.  It was not for 33 A.D. to
1988 A.D.  It was not for all of the people who were in the churches: &ldquo;<b>ye
cannot bear them now</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>All truth</b>&rdquo;&mdash;the Holy Spirit was poured out in Acts 2,
but there is no way that anyone can argue that the churches were guided into &ldquo;<b>all
truth</b>.&rdquo;  They had many errors, many false teachings on seemingly basic
doctrines, such as baptism and salvation.  How a person becomes saved, they
were in error.  </p>

<p>Well, the Bible teaches us that there is a second outpouring
of the Holy Spirit during the time of the Great Tribulation, the time of the
latter rain, the second Jubilee&mdash;however you want to put it.  Now the Holy
Spirit is teaching and opening up the Scriptures to the full measure of the
cup.  To the full amount of information that God would want His people to know,
it is being filled up and He is revealing Himself.  </p>

<p>Look at John 16:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the <span class="underline">time</span>
cometh&hellip;  </p>

<p>What correction can I make here, because this is the same
Greek word, <i>hora</i>:G5610?  This is the Greek word that means &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Jesus is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the [<i>hour</i>]
cometh&hellip;  </p>

<p>And we know that &ldquo;<b>without a parable [<i>proverb</i>]
spake he not unto them</b>.&rdquo;  The whole Bible has hidden truth in view
everywhere.  Therefore, this is not just referring to the proverbs or the
parables that Jesus spoke.  It is all Scripture.  It is all Scripture, because
He is the Word.  He is the embodiment of the Word of God.  </p>

<p>So He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but the [<i>hour</i>] cometh, when I shall no more speak unto
you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.</p>

<p>The hour comes, the Great Tribulation, and this is where we
are and this is what He is doing.  He is showing us plainly, plainly.  </p>

<p>Go back to John 16:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of them&hellip;  </p>

<p>In order to remember, it means that we had to experience
something.  We read something, we saw something, we heard something, and we
recall it to mind.  It is brought back into our memory.  </p>

<p>For instance, the butler forgot Joseph.  He forgot that
Joseph had interpreted his dream.  Later when Pharaoh had a dream, the butler
remembered his faults and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, that Hebrew in prison, he can
interpret your dream, Pharaoh.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Actually, when we look at what the Bible means by
remembering, it has to do with recalling a Scripture or a teaching of the Bible
and understanding it&mdash;understanding it.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 16, which is a discussion with the apostles
and Christ over bread.  It says in Matthew 16:6-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. And they reasoned among themselves, saying,

<i>It is </i>because we have taken no bread.<i> Which </i>when Jesus perceived,
he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves,
because ye have brought no bread? Do ye not yet understand, neither remember
the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither
the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? How is
it that ye do not understand&hellip;   </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 16:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then understood they how that he bade <i>them </i>not beware of
the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 
</p>

<p>To understand is to remember.  We can read a verse in the
Bible repeatedly, again and again and again, and we do not understand it; but
then when it is opened up to us, we respond, &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This happened to me with Revelation 13:8.  If you remember
awhile back, Mr. Camping began showing how Christ was &ldquo;<b>the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world</b>&rdquo; and that this was not in principle but in
fact, that this actually occurred.  I remember hearing this.  I do not know if I
thought this immediately, but I thought, &ldquo;Oh, that is right.  It says it
plainly.  He was &lsquo;<b>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</b>.&rsquo;  It
does not say &lsquo;in principle.&rsquo;  It does not say that.  This is a matter-of-fact
statement.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How about when we learned about annihilation?  Once our
minds were unclouded from all of our past understanding, we saw verses like &ldquo;<b>In
that very day his thoughts perish</b>&rdquo; or being &ldquo;<b>cut off</b>&rdquo; or how God
uses the word &ldquo;<b>hell</b>&rdquo; in relation to &ldquo;<b>the grave</b>.&rdquo;  It was all
right there in front of us, but then we remembered.  We understood what the
Bible was saying, what Christ meant when He spoke those words.  </p>

<p>This is how it has been with many of these understandings,
these teachings that have been opening up at this time as the Holy Ghost not
only is speaking&mdash;yes, He is; as we compare Scripture with Scripture, &ldquo;<b>the
Holy Ghost teacheth</b>&rdquo;&mdash;but He is also guiding our understanding.  He is
showing that He will guide us into &ldquo;<b>all truth</b>.&rdquo;  He is in total control
of opening it up and of bringing understanding in a correct way to what the
Bible is saying.  </p>

<p>Look also at Luke 17:32, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife.  </p>

<p>Again, when we remember this like, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember.  That
is in Genesis; I remember,&rdquo; this is not remembering Lot&rsquo;s wife.  Lot&rsquo;s wife is
someone who &ldquo;<b>looked back</b>&rdquo; as she fled from Sodom, &ldquo;<b>and she became a
pillar of salt</b>.&rdquo;  God judged her and destroyed her at that point; and so the
Lord wants us to remember her in order to teach us that if we have come out of
the church, we are not to look back: &ldquo;Do not go back.  Do not even look back. 
Do not have any longings for what you left behind.  Do not do that, because &lsquo;<b>remember
</b><b>Lot</b><b>&rsquo;s wife</b>,&rsquo;&rdquo; and there is even more information involved
with this.  </p>

<p>We will wind this up in Luke 24:6-8, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He is not here&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the tomb when Christ rose from the dead
that early Sunday morning.  </p>

<p class="verse">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you&hellip;   </p>

<p>Remember:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;remember&rdquo; is a different Greek word, but they are
derived from the same Greek word.  They are in the same family, and so we can
have the same understanding of what this is trying to say.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, Saying,
The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered his words,  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, He did tell us very directly that on the third day He
would rise,&rdquo; but they did not get it.  They did not get it, so then this is
explained to them by God Himself in the form of the angels who were in the
tomb. </p>

<p>So when we are told to remember, it is the Holy Spirit
guiding us into truth.  This was a small example, but this is exactly what is
going on today.  Christ spoke the words.  There are no additional words.  It is
the same Bible down through the centuries, except the difference is that we are
at the time of the end.  He who was to come has come and is speaking in showing
us what the Bible is saying and accurately teaching.  He is doing this by
bringing to our remembrance this Scripture and that Scripture and then another
Scripture.  It is all proved by the Word of God itself.  </p>

<p>Let us close with prayer.  Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank
You for Your grace and for Your Word that is so far above us that there is no
way that any human being could comprehend or understand what You have said in
the Bible.  Your thoughts are higher than our thoughts as the heaven is from
the earth.  Our only hope is that You would be our guide, as Philip guided the
Ethiopian eunuch who had questions.  When we have questions, our hope is that
You would show us what these things mean.  Father, this gives us great
encouragement because we know that You have been doing this.  We can see this
and have experienced it already.  This gives us encouragement that You will
continue to help us with maybe a couple of verses that we are struggling with. 
We do thank You for Your plan of salvation and Your great mercy.  Father, we
pray for wisdom today.  As we go our different ways, give us grace and wisdom
to do Your will and to accomplish Your purpose, which is sending forth Your
Word.  We pray for our family members who are unsaved.  We do ask that You
might have mercy on them, and we pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>

<p>Tonight at 9:00 P.M., we will be on Paltalk for an hour and,
Lord willing, this coming week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at lunch time. 
It will not be a study but an open discussion on Paltalk on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday, from 12:00 to 1:00 P.M. ET in the &ldquo;May 21 2011 Judgment Day&rdquo; room in the Christianity section.  On Tuesday and Thursday, we will be on in the
evening in the same area from 10:00 to 11:30 P.M. ET.  </p>

<p>(There was no question/answer session pertaining to this
study.)  </p>
