<p>As we know, we are at the very end of the world, and this is
what I would like to look at today.  We are living in that end-time situation. 
We are right there.  Judgment Day is only a few months away.  </p>

<p>When we begin to contemplate this, we realize that it is a
very awesome thing that we are living in that time and that the end of the
world is at hand.  It is right here.  </p>

<p>If there was ever a time when we ought to be looking inward,
it is now.  We ought not to be pointing a finger at someone else.  The finger
ought to be pointed at me.  Am I ready to meet God?  Are you ready to meet
God?  This is a very important question.  </p>

<p>According to God&rsquo;s Word, we know that He is &ldquo;no respecter of
persons.&rdquo;  God can save anyone.  No matter how deep you are in your sin or how
rebellious you might be, the grace of God is beyond human comprehension.  God
can save anyone.  As we read the Bible, we see that He will save a harlot; He
will save this person and that person.  </p>

<p>Some of us who are saved and here today were in deep sin and
we would want no one to know the sins that we have committed; but God, in His
mercy, has forgiven us if we are a child of God.  How wonderful this is and how
wonderful it is that the grace of God is still available today.  </p>

<p>Now, at this time, God has let us know what He is about to
do.  This is only due to God&rsquo;s mercy.  It is only because of His mercy that He
has done this.  He did not have to do this.  He could let this world go right
up to May 21, 2011, Judgment Day, just like that.  He could have done that. 
However, God in His infinite wisdom and mercy has let us know what He is about
to do and He has done this through the Bible.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Genesis 18.  Before God brought judgment, God
always let His people know what He was about to do.  This is how He operates. 
Look at Genesis 18:17.  He is about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.  Abraham was
a saved man and God let him know what He was about to do.  We read in Genesis
18:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
do;  </p>

<p>Of course, we know that He did not.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 18:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  </p>

<p>Now go to verse 20 of the same chapter.  We read in Genesis
18:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see
whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come
unto me; and if not, I will know.  </p>

<p>God was about to bring judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah and He
let Abraham know what He was about to do.  As it is in our day when God is
about to end the world, we can expect that He would do the same thing and let
His people know what He is about to do.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 18:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom:
but Abraham stood yet before JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>As we read on, we will see Abraham pleading for the people
of Sodom and Gomorrah.  We of course know that God finally destroyed them;
however, my point is that God let Abraham know what He was about to do, which
was to bring judgment.  </p>

<p>This is as it is in our day.  It is because of God&rsquo;s mercy
that He is letting the world know through His people what He is about to do,
which He has revealed to us from the pages of the Bible.  This is not a random
date that we picked out of the sky.  God has laid out all of this information
pertaining to the end of the world and it is coming from God&rsquo;s Word, the
Bible.  We could expect that God would let His people know when He was about to
bring judgment, because this is how He operates.  </p>

<p>Turn over to Amos 3.  We read in Amos 3:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city&hellip;  </p>

<p>What trumpet is this?  We are the true believers and we are
trumpeting this information throughout the world: over the Internet, through
tracts, through radio.  We are telling them that Judgment Day is coming.  How
can we sit still knowing that this information is coming from the Bible?  How
could we not warn the world?  </p>

<p>So what would we want to do first when it comes to warning
the world of this?  First, we would want to tell this to our family members.  </p>

<p>Let us turn back over to Genesis.  I forgot to bring this
point up when we were there.  When God was about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah,
He went to Lot.  What was the first thing that Lot did?  </p>

<p>Here we are today and we know this information from the
Bible.  Judgment Day will be May 21, 2011.  One of the first things that we
want to do is to tell our family members.  A true believer will do this.  We will
want to tell our immediate friends and loved ones, &ldquo;Judgment Day is almost
here.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Remember that Lot went to his sons-in-law.  Turn to Genesis
19.  Some of the first people whom we want to go to are our family members, our
loved ones, those who are close to us.  We read in Genesis 19:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law&hellip;  </p>

<p>He went to his sons-in-law:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked&hellip;  </p>

<p>They laughed at him!    </p>

<p>How many of us have experienced this?  You tell your mom,
you tell your dad, you tell your children, and they will not listen to you. 
They will not take it seriously and they will laugh.  </p>

<p>Lot&rsquo;s sons-in-law laughed but, lo and behold, it was true! 
They got destroyed in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, along with everyone
who was there, because they did not listen to this warning from God.  </p>

<p>How many are not listening today?  They are not listening to
this information that is coming from the Bible.  They think, &ldquo;Oh, this is not
going to happen!&rdquo;  Whatever excuse that they give just proves that they are not
listening to this information from the Bible, but this is so.  This <span class="underline">is</span>
going to happen.  </p>

<p>Returning to Amos 3:6, knowing this information as true
believers, we are going to sound the alarm.  We are going to sound this
warning.  In Amos 3:6-8, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done <i>it?</i> Surely
the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
prophets. The lion hath roared&hellip;  </p>

<p>We watch those nature programs and we see the lion chasing
the impala.  The lion is a very fearsome animal in the jungle.  All the other
animals tremble at the roar of the lion, and here God is a lion who has
roared.  He is sounding the warning that Judgment Day is almost here.  Will you
not pay attention to this?  Are you just going to keep on doing your own thing
and pay no attention to this warning that is coming from the Bible?  How
foolish you will be if you do not listen to what the Bible has to say.  </p>

<p>So it says in Amos 3:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath
spoken, who can but prophesy? Publish in the palaces at Ashdod&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can see from verse 9 that a true believer is going to
publish this.  By God&rsquo;s grace, we are going to make this known as He gives us
the means to do so.  </p>

<p class="verse">Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land
of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold
the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof. 
</p>

<p>So we are going to publish this information as far and as wide
as the Lord Jesus would have us do so because this is to be known by man.  &ldquo;The
lion hath roared,&rdquo; Judgment Day is almost here, and we had better listen to
this.  We had better listen to what God has to say from the Bible because the
Bible is the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Whether we believe this or not, Judgment Day has been
appointed by God.  This day is set and we cannot change it.  This day has been
appointed by God and we are heading towards it.  </p>

<p>Mercifully, wonderfully, He has let us know.  This is the
mercy of God even though many people do not want to hear this.  They do not
want to talk about it.  They do not want to face up to it.  They go into
denial.  They lock it out.  They laugh at you.  They mock.  However, let it be
known that none of this is going to change this fact.  </p>

<p>Many people are saying, &ldquo;Not so, Lord.  Not so; this cannot
be!  I have my full life ahead of me.  I have things to do.  I have to get
married.  I have to do this or that.&rdquo;  But, no!  God&rsquo;s will supersedes any and
all of that.  Nothing is going to change the fact that we are at the end of the
world and we ought to face up to this.  Face up to it!  We are right here at
the end.  </p>

<p>Maybe a lot of people think that they are just having a bad
dream and that this just cannot be.  We are all a part of this world but there are
those who love this world too much&mdash;the homes, the niceties, the toys, the cars&mdash;but
all of these things are vanity.  What are you going to do with them?  Come May
21<sup>st</sup> in 2011, these things will be useless.  On that day, these
things are going to be the last thing on your mind.  </p>

<p>On that day, do you think that you are going to be thinking
about your bank account or whatever it might be that you have?  No.  The things
in this life are not important.  They are not important.  If you were to die
today or tomorrow, you could take none of it with you.  </p>

<p>How much of this world&rsquo;s goods can you take with you?  How
much are you going to take with you when you die?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Your
body is going to go down into the ground, you are going to be buried, and then
you are going to rot.  </p>

<p>These things do not mean a thing.  The important thing is
salvation.  It makes no difference what your status in life is or where you are
from.  All of this means nothing.  If you are not a child of God, you are in
deep and terrible trouble with God.  You are headed for destruction on that day
of judgment.  </p>

<p>Many people are afraid of this and do not want to deal with
it.  There is a reason for this.  Deep in their hearts, they know that they are
not ready.  However, wonderfully, there is still time.  There is still time for
us to respond as the people of Nineveh did who cried mightily to God.  It may
be that God might have mercy upon you, but how foolish it is if you do not
listen to God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Ezekiel 33, which is a familiar passage.  God
tells us in the Bible that we are now looking at the closeness of the end of
the world.  We are right there.  If you are a true believer, this is the way
that you are to be living your whole life if you say that you are a child of
God.  As true believers, we see the sword coming.  This sword is for killing. 
The Bible is known as the &ldquo;sword of the Spirit.&rdquo;  We see Judgment Day coming,
and it says in Ezekiel 33:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
trumpet, and warn the people; Then whosoever heareth&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that the only way that we are going to hear this is
if God gives us ears to hear.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own
head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall
be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.  </p>

<p>Then God goes on.</p>

<p>As true believers, we are watchmen.  We are going to sound
the alarm because we know what God is about to do.  God lets His people know, just
as Abraham knew, as well as these other events that we read about in the Old
Testament.  They knew because God let them know what He was about to do.  </p>

<p>God did not hide what He was about to do from Abraham, did
He?  No, God spelled out to him that Sodom and Gomorrah were going to be
overthrown.  He let Jonah know what He was about to do to Nineveh, did He not? 
Wonderfully, in God&rsquo;s mercy, He spared the city of Nineveh.  </p>

<p>These are huge examples for us who are alive today.  It is
as if we are living in the days of Nineveh when the trumpet was blown.  The
trumpet is blown.  In 18 months and a couple of weeks, Judgment Day is going to
be here.  What are you doing with your time?  Think about this.  This is a
little over 18 months away.  This can be broken down into weeks and days and
hours.  What are you doing with the time remaining?  Are you just wasting it? 
We are not talking about 1800 years or 18 years.  We are talking about 18
months.  This is really not a long time.  There is not a long time remaining in
this life: 18 months and Judgment Day will be here, 18 short months.  </p>

<p>This year is almost done.  It is almost complete.  Then we
have 12 months left to next year.  In reality, we have two Christmases left,
this one and another one, just two more.  Before you know it, this time next
year will be here and we will be looking at another Thanksgiving holiday and
another Christmas.  Then we will be at the end of 2010 and we will start into
January of 2011.  We will have January, February, March, April, and then May.  </p>

<p>At this time next year, we will only have November, December,
January, February, March, April, and then May.  So next year at this time, we
will only have seven months left, seven months left to go, and then we will be
looking at Judgment Day.  This is not a lot of time.  If ever there was a time
when we ought to be beseeching God for His mercy, it is today.  </p>

<p>There are those who may not know any other verse in the
Bible who take great comfort in the verse that says that no one knows the day
or the hour.  There are many who take great comfort in this verse and who hide
behind it.  They comfort themselves with this verse, &ldquo;No one knows the day or
hour.&rdquo;  This is their response to you and then they turn around and walk away. 
They have taken great comfort in this verse.  They believe that no one can
know, so they go away and just continue on with their lives.  </p>

<p>God, however, warns us.  He lets us know what the people of
Noah&rsquo;s day were doing.  In Luke 17, He lets us know how the people were living
right before the flood.  The people of our day are doing the same thing, the
very same thing.  In Luke 17, God also tells us what was going on in the days
of Lot.  God tells us in Luke 17:26-27:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
days of the Son of man. They did eat&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what they were doing right before the flood.  God is
telling us what they were doing:  </p>

<p class="verse">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and
destroyed them all. </p>

<p>They went right up until that moment; they went right up
until that very day.  For decades, Noah had declared the Gospel.  It went out. 
This warning got around over the hundred plus years that it took him to build
the ark.  This word got around.  Word of mouth is a very powerful thing.  This
person told that person and it got around, but they went on with their daily
routine as it says here.  They were marrying and it was just business as
usual.  </p>

<p>What are the people of our world doing today?  They are
building skyscrapers.  People are going to college.  They are continuing on in
doing their own thing, just like the people of Noah&rsquo;s day who did so right up
until the very moment that the flood came.  They did not listen and then the
flood came and destroyed them all.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 17:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the days of Lot that we read about in
Genesis.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted,
they builded;  </p>

<p>It was the same thing.  This was the same thing that they
did in Noah&rsquo;s day and this was what they did right before God destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah.  </p>

<p>What are people doing today?  We are doing the same thing,
and God said that it would be this way.  However, this time, it is the end of
the world.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 17:29-32:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <i>them </i>all. Even thus shall it be in
the day when the Son of man is revealed.  </p>

<p>It is going to be the same thing.  </p>

<p class="verse">In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the
field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife.  </p>

<p>It is just going to be a repeat of the same thing.  They
were doing the same thing in the days of Lot, the same thing in the days of
Noah, and the same thing is going to be going on in our day.  People are not
listening to the Bible.  They are concerned with planning their future, all of
these things, and they will continue doing so right up until that moment on May
21<sup>st</sup> when the earthquake hits.  </p>

<p>At that point, mankind will know that Judgment Day has
come.  It will be too late to cry for mercy.  The day of salvation will be
over.  All of the true believers will have been taken out of this world.  All
who remain will just be the unsaved.  The &ldquo;light of the candle,&rdquo; the Gospel,
will have been put out.  The day of mercy will have come to an end.  All of the
true believers will have been caught up to be with Christ in their new
spiritual bodies.  All who will be left will just be the unsaved.  This is a
sobering fact.  </p>

<p>If this does not get your attention, what will?  What will
get your attention?  It is no longer business as usual.  The bright future that
you might have planned for yourself is not going to happen.  But then, what are
you missing?  </p>

<p>You are not missing anything.  If you never have a chance to
get married, or whatever, you are not missing anything.  If you are a child of
God, you have everything.  You are going to be an inheritor of the new heaven
and the new earth, and this is about to happen shortly.  Which do you really
prefer?  </p>

<p>We look at this world and we see that sin is multiplying. 
It causes us to wonder why God has put up with us for so long.  However, we
know that He has created the world to last a little over 13,000 years.  We know
that His perfect will is going to be done.  He is saving a people for Himself. 
After He is done, He destroys it.  He <span class="underline">will</span> destroy it.  </p>

<p>This is the time when we ought to really, really, really be looking
at ourselves.  We really need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I ready to meet God?&rdquo;  It
does not matter if you are a child or if you are middle-aged or if you are an
older person.  The end of the world is here.  If you want to argue, argue with
the Bible.  However, I would not do that because what God says <span class="underline">is</span> going
to happen.  </p>

<p>This information has no impact on some people&rsquo;s lives,
none.  They hear it, but it goes in one ear and out the next.  It goes right
over their heads.  They are not listening to this.  </p>

<p>Has this information impacted your life?  Has this made a
change in your life?  This is the question that we all have to ask ourselves. 
Has this warning, this information coming from the Bible, has this impacted
your life in such a way to where you are examining yourself, you are crying out
to God for mercy, you are trembling before God and pleading with Him for His
mercy?  Or has this not affected you at all?  Are you that caught up with your
life or your friends or your plans or anything else?  What is it?  What could
be more important than this?  </p>

<p>If this does not get your attention, nothing will.  We are
right at the end of the world and we should be listening to the Bible,
listening to God speaking to us, because it is God who is giving us this
information from the pages of the Bible.  He is not going to hide this
information from His people.  He has let us know in these days what He is about
to do.  I say this again: it is the sheer mercy of God as to why He has done
this.  It is because God is merciful.  </p>

<p>People say, &ldquo;Oh, why do you want to scare people like this?&rdquo; 
However, come May 21<sup>st</sup>, people are going to be frightened right out
of their skin.  If you are not saved, you are going to be scared to death
because Judgment Day is here!  </p>

<p>Let us look at Hebrews 2 because there are those who are not
taking this information that is coming from the Bible seriously.  I cannot make
you take this seriously.  I cannot even make you listen to this.  But here in
Hebrews 2:1-3, God warns:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed&hellip;  </p>

<p>We have this information.  God has made it known what He is
about to do and He is telling us:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore we ought to give the more <span class="underline">earnest</span> heed to the
things which we have heard&hellip;  </p>

<p>What are we hearing in these days?  We are hearing that the day
of judgment is almost here, &ldquo;the end of all things is at hand,&rdquo; and it is going
to be May 21 in 2011.  We are hearing this and God is telling us that we are to
give this &ldquo;the more earnest heed.&rdquo;  We ought to listen to what God is telling
us, to &ldquo;the things which we have heard&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;lest at any time we should let <i>them </i>slip. </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; How shall
we escape&hellip;  </p>

<p>Escape what?  The day of judgment.  How shall we escape the
day of judgment?  The only way that we can escape this is if &ldquo;God is our refuge,&rdquo;
our &ldquo;hiding place,&rdquo; our &ldquo;shield.&rdquo;  As you go through the book of Psalms, you
will see that God uses these terms.  These are the terms that God uses to
indicate that this is the only way that we are going to be able to escape
Judgment Day.  This is the big issue.    </p>

<p class="verse">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them
that heard <i>him;</i>  </p>

<p>How else are we going to be able to escape this?  God has
given us &ldquo;many infallible proofs&rdquo; that these things are going to happen.  This <span class="underline">is</span>
going to happen!  </p>

<p>This word that is translated as &ldquo;earnest&rdquo; in Hebrews 2:1 is
also found in Mark 15.  Christ was on trial and they were about to crucify
Him.  In Mark 15:12-14, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
that I shall do <i>unto him </i>whom ye call the King of the Jews? And they
cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath
he done? And they cried out <span class="underline">the more exceedingly</span>, Crucify him.  </p>

<p>The word that was translated &ldquo;earnest&rdquo; in Hebrews 2:1 is
translated as &ldquo;the more exceedingly&rdquo; here in Mark 15:14.  We are to look at God&rsquo;s
Word and take it very seriously.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Mark 15:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>so </i>Pilate, willing to content the people, released
Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i>him, </i>to be
crucified.  </p>

<p>So this word &ldquo;exceedingly&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;earnest.&rdquo;  God
uses it another way in 1 Thessalonians 2:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
presence, not in heart, endeavoured the <span class="underline">more abundantly</span> to see your face
with great desire.  </p>

<p>Exceedingly/earnest is this word that has been translated &ldquo;more
abundantly.&rdquo;  We are to have an <span class="underline">abundant</span> concern and listen very <span class="underline">earnestly</span>

to what God is saying to us.  We are to give &ldquo;the more earnest heed&rdquo; to what
God is telling us.  We are to listen to what He is saying because it is God who
is speaking to us from the pages of the Bible.  </p>

<p>You have to listen very carefully because these things are
serious and they are going to affect you.  It makes no difference how old you
are or whatever.  Judgment Day is going to affect you, one way or the other.  You
are to give &ldquo;the more earnest heed&rdquo; to what God is telling you because this information
has not been conjured up from someone&rsquo;s mind.  This is God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible,
as if God is standing in front of you and talking to you face-to-face.  You
ought to listen to what He has to say because &ldquo;the lion hath roared&rdquo; and
Judgment Day is almost here.  </p>

<p>Returning to Hebrews 2:3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">How shall we escape, if we <span class="underline">neglect</span> so great salvation&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; is used in Matthew 22 [<i>note: speaker
inadvertently said &ldquo;escape&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;</i>].  This word is used in
Matthew 22 and it is translated as those who are making light of God&rsquo;s Word.  It
says in Matthew 22:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">But they <span class="underline">made light of</span> <i>it</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;made light of&rdquo; is the same word that is
translated as &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in Hebrews 2:3 [<i>note: speaker inadvertently said &ldquo;escape&rdquo;

instead of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;</i>].  </p>

<p>There are those who are making light of this information
from the Bible concerning the end of the world and Judgment Day.  You go out to
hand out tracts and you get mocked, you get laughed at, people fuss at you, and
so forth.  They are making light of this information.  </p>

<p>Let us read the whole verse.  Matthew 22:5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But they made light of <i>it, </i>and went their ways, one to
his farm, another to his merchandise:  </p>

<p>People hear this information, they make fun of it, and they
are not taking this seriously.  What do they do?  They go back to their daily
lives, their daily routines, as if they never heard a thing.  They just go back
to their lives.  They hear the warning of Judgment Day and there are many who
are making light of this, &ldquo;Oh, you cannot know the day or the hour.  You are
crazy!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We hear these types of callers on the &ldquo;Open Forum.&rdquo;  They
want to argue and argue and argue the Bible.  They want to argue the Scriptures
instead of listening to the Bible and being as the Bereans of old who &ldquo;searched
the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.&rdquo;  Instead of doing this,
they just shrug this off.  </p>

<p>So we have these mockers.  We have those who are mocking
this information.  They are mocking the Bible and paying no attention to this. 
I hope that none of us are doing this.  I hope that none of us are making light
of this information that is coming from the Bible.  You should not be doing
this.  If you are, you need to stop what you are doing and listen to the
Bible.  </p>

<p>Let us return to Hebrews 2:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation&hellip;    </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is great.  When we read the Bible and we see
what Christ had to do to save a people for Himself, it boggles the human mind
that God would go through all of this trouble to save a rebellious people as we
are by nature.  </p>

<p>We know that God can save anyone: a child in the womb, a
two-year-old, a three-year-old, a ten-year-old, a teenager, someone who is
twenty years old, no matter what your age.  Can God hear the prayer of a child? 
Of course He can!  It has nothing to do with how fancy your prayer is or the
words that you are saying, because God looks at the heart of the person.  </p>

<p>If you know that you are not saved, if you are troubled, if
you are frightened of Judgment Day, what should you be doing?  You should be
crying out to God as the Ninevites did.  We know that God is a merciful,
merciful God, so this ought to be your priority.  The number one priority in
life ought to be your relationship with God because you know that you are
headed for this rendezvous with God on May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  </p>

<p>It is coming.  Each day, each week, each month goes by. 
That date is getting closer and closer and closer.  You cannot relive last
week.  It is gone.  That time is gone forever and you cannot go back.  But as
of today, you can thank God that you are still living, that the blood is warm
in your veins, that God is still saving people, and that maybe He might save
you, too.  </p>

<p>We want to make this the number one priority in our lives if
we are not doing so.  Life should not be fun and games.  This is serious
information that God is giving us.  He has let us know what He is about to do. 
</p>

<p>What are you doing with this information?  God speaks of
those who &ldquo;shall be beaten with many stripes.&rdquo;  You know this information.  It
is not as if you never heard this, so I think that your punishment is going to
be way worse than those who have never heard this even though they are &ldquo;worthy
of stripes.&rdquo;  You know this information.  </p>

<p>We know the very year and the very day of Judgment Day. 
Wow!  We may not know the hour on May 21, 2011, but this is a lot of
information and it should scare you right out of your skin.  </p>

<p>This God who is infinite in His wisdom has the ability to
bring this world to an end.  He created it and He can bring it to an end.  He
is not bluffing us.  He is telling us the truth.  He is about to return on May 21, 2011.  Time is of the essence and we should never make light of this information. 
We should never shrug this off.  This <span class="underline">is</span> going to happen.  The proofs
are there.  He did not give us one proof.  He gave us several proofs to show us
that this information is so.  </p>

<p>Let us look at 2 Peter 3 where God goes on to give us some
information.  The day of the Lord will come.  This is a given.  </p>

<p>When we listen to unsaved man speak, he consistently talks
about the end, the coming doomsday and destruction.  Unsaved man knows this. 
He knows because of the way that God has designed him.  He knows that there is
an end coming to this planet and this universe.  He knows this.  We hear it in
the worldly songs, in the way that he talks.  They know that this world is
going to end.  They may not believe the Bible or care about what the Bible
says, but mankind knows that there is an end coming.  </p>

<p>Even if the Lord would tarry for another hundred years, not
one of us would be living.  There are always exceptions and some people live to
be 100 or 103 or so.  However, if the Lord would tarry maybe even another 50-60
years, all of us in this room right now would be dead, every single one of us. 
</p>

<p>I am not old, but I am getting there.  Lord willing, this
month I will be 49 years old and I do not think that this world will be here
for me to see 51.  If the Lord would tarry, I would not see another 50-60
years.  Time is of the essence and it does not make a difference how old you
are today.  Time is running out.  </p>

<p>So we read in 2 Peter 3:1-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i>both </i>which
I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: That ye may be mindful of the
words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of
us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: Knowing this first, that there shall come
in the last days scoffers&hellip;  </p>

<p>We all know that there are scoffers out there who are making
a mockery of this information.  They are just laughing at this, &ldquo;Come May 22<sup>nd</sup>,
I will still be here.&rdquo;  We hear them and they are just scoffing at this
information.  They make light of it.  They do not listen to you.  They do
whatever.  They just do not want to be reminded of this.  They are just
scoffing at the Bible and:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise
of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they
were </i>from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are
ignorant of&hellip;  </p>

<p>Mankind, unsaved man, he is ignorant because this is what
the Bible calls him.  He is ignorant:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth
standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was,
being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are
now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
judgment and perdition of ungodly men. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
one thing, that one day <i>is </i>with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as
some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 2 Peter 3:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come&hellip;  </p>

<p>This will be May 21, 2011 when the day of judgment will
begin.  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come&hellip;  </p>

<p>You cannot change this.  You cannot wish this away.  You
cannot hope that this will not happen.  There are many who are hoping that this
will not happen.  They are working overtime to try to prove that this
information is not so.  They would give their right arm for this information to
not be correct.  However, we know that this is not incorrect because God has
given us &ldquo;many infallible proofs&rdquo; that these things are going to happen.   </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night&rdquo; for those who are not
ready to meet Him.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat&hellip;  </p>

<p>This information that we are reading in 2 Peter 3:10 is what will happen on October 21, 2011.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the heavens shall pass away&hellip;  </p>

<p>During that five-month period, the earth is still going along. 
People will still be here suffering through the most horrible punishment.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the elements shall melt with fervent heat&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what will happen on October 21, 2011.  All of the elements and whatever God uses to uphold the universe and whatever is out there,
it is all going to melt.  God is going to burn it up.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the works that are therein shall be burned up.  </p>

<p>Everything that you own, whatever you have on that day, on October 21, 2011, is going to be burned up.  </p>

<p>Then God says in 2 Peter 3:11:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Seeing </i>then <i>that </i>all these things shall be
dissolved&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that these things are going to be burned up, so:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;what manner <i>of persons </i>ought ye to be in <i>all </i>holy
conversation and godliness,  </p>

<p>We need to make sure that we are born again.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 2 Peter 3:12-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Looking for&hellip;  </p>

<p>Where do we look?  We look in the Bible.  </p>

<p class="verse">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is May 21, 2011.  That is &ldquo;the day of God&rdquo; when
Judgment Day begins.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see how God is driving home that these things are
going to be dissolved?  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?  Nevertheless
we&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the true believers.  We:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace&hellip;   </p>

<p>In other words, make sure that the peace of God is upon you and
that you are a child of God:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;without spot&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are &ldquo;without spot&rdquo; when our sins have been forgiven, when
God has given us eternal life:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and blameless.  </p>

<p>We become &ldquo;blameless&rdquo; before God when our sins are paid
for.  We are &ldquo;without spot.&rdquo;  We are &ldquo;without blemish.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the great hope of those who are truly children of
God.  We are going to be the inheritors of the new heaven and the new earth
when the Lord Jesus returns.  However, &ldquo;the day is at hand.&rdquo;  He has let us
know what He is about to do.  He is about to return and we had better listen to
what He has to say because time is of the essence.  Time is running out.  </p>

<p>What is your priority?  Remember that God tells us in
Matthew 6, &ldquo;But seek ye first the kingdom of God.&rdquo;  We are not to seek the
creature comforts of this life.  God did not say that.  Our whole attention as
we live out our lives in this world ought to be to &ldquo;seek ye first the kingdom
 of God, and his righteousness&rdquo; because we do not have any righteousness of our
own.  </p>

<p>Do you see what we are to be spending our time doing?  We
are to be seeking the Kingdom of God.  God has a lot more to say about this,
but this is where our priority ought to be because Judgment Day is fast
approaching.  </p>

<p>Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, we thank You O Lord that You
have let us know what You are about to do.  It is only because of Thy mercy
that You have let us know this.  O Father, have us to look at ourselves
honestly.  We know, O Lord, according to Your Word, if there is anyone who
might not be saved, they can still beseech Thee for mercy.  It might be that
You might forgive them of their sins and save them.  We pray that You will work
in us, O Lord, that You will quicken us according to Thy Word.  We pray for our
children and for our family members who are not saved.  O Lord, how we desire their
salvation!  But, O Lord, we pray that Thy perfect will be done in all things. 
Dear Lord, we thank You for this time together around Thy Word.  We pray as we
go home that You may give us traveling mercies.  This coming week, O Lord, may
we spend time reading Thy Word, reading Thy Word, reading Thy Word, and just
listening to what You say.  O Lord, could it be that You will have mercy upon
us as we study and seek to do Thy will.  We pray, O Lord, as we share the
Gospel with whomever You put in our path that You might have mercy upon them,
and may You have us not to become weary in well-doing.  O Lord, we thank You
for Thy mercy.  In Jesus&rsquo; Name.  Amen.  </p>

<p>(There was no question/answer session pertaining to this
study.)  </p>
