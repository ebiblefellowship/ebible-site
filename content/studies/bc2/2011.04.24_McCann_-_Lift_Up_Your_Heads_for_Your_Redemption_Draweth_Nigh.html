title: Lift Up Your Heads for Your Redemption Draweth Nigh
---
<p>Let us go to Luke 21.  I am going to read from verse 14.  We
read in Luke 21:14-28:    </p>

<p class="verse">Settle <i>it </i>therefore in your hearts, not to meditate
before what ye shall answer: For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all
your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. And ye shall be
betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and <i>some
</i>of you shall they cause to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all <i>men
</i>for my name&rsquo;s sake. But there shall not an hair of your head perish. In
your patience possess ye your souls. And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed
with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which
are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it
depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For
these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck,
in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon
this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there shall be
signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men&rsquo;s
hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall
they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when
these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for
your redemption draweth nigh.  </p>

<p>The last part of Luke 21:28 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; for your redemption draweth nigh.  </p>

<p>This has to do with the resurrection, the resurrection of
the dead, the resurrection of the people of God.  </p>

<p>Today is Easter and this is a good day to remember the
resurrection of Christ.  We do know that Christ died before the world began and
rose from the dead before the world began, as Romans 1 indicates.  It is stated
there that He was &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the Son&hellip;by the resurrection from the
dead.&rdquo;  Because of or through the resurrection of the dead, He became the Son. 
Jesus entered into the world as the Son of God.  This means that He had already
risen; and then, as the Son, He created the world.  </p>

<p>So when we are thinking about the cross, as Jesus went to
the cross in 33 A.D., we are really just looking at what He did to make
manifest and to declare what He had done before the world began.  Resurrection
Sunday teaches the people of God and assures them that because He rose, so will
they rise.  </p>

<p>As far as the resurrection of the believers, God has done
this in an interesting way.  He does this in two parts.  This is like what we
read about in Revelation 20.  We read in Revelation 20:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them: and <i>I saw </i>the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the
beast, neither his image, neither had received <i>his </i>mark upon their
foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were
finished&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a reference to 1988 when the church age came to a
close and Satan was loosed.  He was bound for a thousand years, and then he was
loosed.  The rest of the dead did not live again; that is, they did not become
saved until this time of Great Tribulation when God plans on saving the &ldquo;great
multitude&rdquo; of people.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Revelation 20:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
years were finished. This <i>is </i>the first resurrection. Blessed and holy <i>is
</i>he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath
no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
him a thousand years.  </p>

<p>We are reigning with Christ and we are seated with Him &ldquo;in
heavenly <i>places</i>,&rdquo; and this goes on forever.  There is no end of this reign
for the believers, and so this thousand years is looking at the completeness of
eternity.  This is a different thousand years.     </p>

<p>God speaks about &ldquo;the first resurrection,&rdquo; and some of the
people here have experienced &ldquo;the first resurrection.&rdquo;  If you are born again,
if you are a child of God, then you have been resurrected.  This is because our
souls, our spirits, were &ldquo;dead in trespasses and sins.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When God saves a person, when He brings His Word, He
resurrects that individual and gives them a new heart and a new spirit.  This
is an actual resurrection because that which was dead is brought to life.  This
is referring to the soul existence or the spirit being of man.  God brings the
Gospel to a house.  Maybe He saves everyone in that home or just one or two. 
They have then experienced &ldquo;the first resurrection.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Has there been any change to them outwardly?  No; we cannot
tell.  As we look around, we cannot tell who is saved or who is not saved. 
This is why we are never to judge.  We are never to make a judgment as to
whether or not someone is saved.  We can have an idea either way, but we really
should leave this with God because God in His wisdom determined to make
salvation two parts or two stages.  The first stage is the soul.  </p>

<p>When we think about this, He had to do this, right?  If God
gave complete salvation of body and of soul at the moment an individual became
saved, how could they continue to operate in this world?  </p>

<p>When we read of Moses and Elijah on the Mount of
Transfiguration, they were shining with Christ with the brilliance of the sun;
but the saved cannot go about the world with the Gospel if they are shining
with the brilliance of the sun.  The world would not be able to accept this. 
Even when Moses went up into the mountain and was with God, he came down and
his face shone.  The Israelites &ldquo;were afraid to come nigh him,&rdquo; and so he had
to put a veil over his face.  </p>

<p>So it just was not practical for God to perform a complete
salvation on individuals.  Remember that the moment someone is saved, it is
like they are transported into Heaven to be seated in Christ.  Then they are
dispatched right away to earth to be a messenger of the Gospel.  In order to
carry out this duty, we have to keep these bodies.  We have to continue in
these bodies.  Then the world is not afraid of someone who is standing on the
corner who looks just like them or like anybody else.  They just seem like they
are just another person and it is not known that there is a big difference and
that this individual has been resurrected the first time in their soul, which
is the first resurrection, and has a promise of the completed action.  </p>

<p>This is one big reason for why we do desire this day to come
- the day of the resurrection, the day of the rapture - because we only have
half.  We cannot really say what portion, but we only have a partial salvation
and we need to be completely saved.  We have to be rid of these physical bodies
that are still seeing corruption.  </p>

<p>This is also why even after someone is saved, they continue
to age, their body continues to deteriorate, and they will eventually die. 
This is because their body has not been saved yet; only the spirit.  Since
their spirit is saved, when someone who is saved dies, the Bible says that &ldquo;to
be absent from the body&rdquo; is to be &ldquo;present with the Lord.&rdquo;  Their soul is
already prepared and they go into Heaven, but their body has not yet been
prepared for Heaven.  The body goes into the ground and has to wait.  </p>

<p>All those who have died throughout history have to wait for this
day, as Job said, &ldquo;I know <i>that </i>my redeemer liveth&rdquo; and that one day his
body would be brought up and would rise.  This is the hope of the children of
God: to receive a new resurrected body, which is going to be something that we
just cannot comprehend.  Our bodies are weak.  We are prone to illness and, of
course, death.  </p>

<p>Children, you may not realize this yet.  Most of you
probably feel strong.  You probably feel that you can run all day, and some of
you do; but this is just a little temporary period and then the body begins to
see corruption.  It begins to weaken until it finally will die in this life.  </p>

<p>However, there is this promise to the people of God.  One
place that we read about this promise is in Proverbs 23:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <i>be thou </i>in the fear
of JEHOVAH all the day long. For surely there is an end; and thine expectation
shall not be cut off.  </p>

<p>This is our expectation.  It is the hope of the promise of
God, and He has promised eternal life.  This does not just relate to our soul,
but a whole new complete personality, body and soul, forever and ever.  </p>

<p>We read incredible things in relation to this new body.  It
is a body that will not sorrow.  It is a body that will not cry.  It is a body
that will not see death.  This is going to be an incredible creation that God
will give to His people.  It is going to be a body that will be equipped to
exist and to live forever and ever and ever.  It will have no sin.  It will
have no disease of any kind.  Nothing bad will ever harm it or kill it.  This
will be impossible.  God tells us this repeatedly in many places.  It is
salvation forever, eternal life.  </p>

<p>Some people just want to live in this world to be one
hundred.  They do not care if they have to be stooped over and if they have to
kind of walk very slowly and if they cannot make too sudden of a move because
they might break a hip.  They are prone to all sorts of illnesses.  It is a
very difficult life as we get older and older and our bodies are aging, and yet
people just want to live in any kind of condition.  They just want to live
because they are afraid of death.  </p>

<p>What does death offer to the person of the world?  It is an
end of this life, and so people want to keep living; but this is not really
living.  The living that God talks about is just way, way, way beyond our
ability to even imagine.  Whatever your greatest desire has been, your greatest
hope for living in this life, magnify this a billion times and it still would
not be enough.  We will be a perfect body at the time of the resurrection of
the dead, and this is coming 26/27 days on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  The hope of
God&rsquo;s people all throughout time is about to be realized in less than four
weeks, and so we just stand amazed.  </p>

<p>I just want to look at this one verse again and then we will
move on.  We read in Luke 21:28 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.  </p>

<p>Go to Romans 8:23.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And not only <i>they</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, the creation groaning and travailing in pain.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, <i>to wit, </i>the
redemption of our body.  </p>

<p>We have the firstfruits.  We have the Holy Spirit.  We have
a new resurrected soul.  God is indicating here that this produces a groaning
and that we are waiting still.  We are to wait on the Lord.  Some might be
waiting on Him for the first resurrection, and this is good.  They are still
waiting for Him to resurrect their souls; but also, even after God saves a
sinner and gives them a new spirit, we still have to wait.  We wait for the
completion of all things.  </p>

<p>This is spoken about in Hebrews 11, which is the chapter of
faith.  We read in Hebrews 11:39-40:  </p>

<p class="verse">And these all&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, all of the men of faith who came before.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;having obtained a good report through faith, received not the
promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
should not be made perfect.  </p>

<p>They had the first resurrection.  Noah was saved by grace. 
David was saved by grace.  But they have not received the completion, the
body.  God says that they have not received that promise yet because He has
provided something better; that is, everybody gets this at the same time, which
is what 1 Thessalonians 4:17 is speaking about.  It is the day of the rapture
and the day of the resurrection when God is equipping His people with that new
spiritual body that will live forever.  </p>

<p>The redemption is spoken about in Ephesians 1.  After God
lays out in the first couple of verses His plan of election and predestination,
that He chose which ones He would save out of the whole of mankind, we read in
Ephesians 1:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us
accepted in the beloved. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;  </p>

<p>We have redemption in Christ and Christ&rsquo;s name is actually
Redemption as well as Wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30, which says that He is &ldquo;made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.&rdquo;  He is
the essence of redemption.  Everything that the Bible says about redemption has
to do with the Lord Jesus.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ephesians 1:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">In whom ye also <i>trusted, </i>after that ye heard the word of
truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed&hellip;  </p>

<p>This would be the belief that God gives with a new heart. 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession,
unto the praise of his glory.  </p>

<p>God is dragging out this sentence and throwing a lot of
things in here, but He is basically saying that we have been sealed because we
have the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit is the &ldquo;earnest of our
inheritance.&rdquo;  It is our down payment.  It is like the earnest money that is
talked about when someone is buying a house.  The Holy Spirit, within the child
of God, is God&rsquo;s guarantee that He will finish their salvation, that He will
complete it, that He will redeem their body just like He has redeemed their
soul.  </p>

<p>So the Holy Spirit is actually evidence to the child of God
of the truthfulness and faithfulness of God and His Word to do what He has said
what He will do in the matter of salvation.  He will save the sinner completely
and entirely, both in spirit and then in body, on the day of the resurrection. 
</p>

<p>I actually want to go back to Luke 21 and read about this
day of redemption, because God gives us indicators of when this is going to
be.  We know when this is going to be.  We know that it will be on May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
All the evidence of the Bible points to this.  But it is interesting how He
makes reference to this in Luke 21:28, and so I would like to go through some
of the preceding verses; for example, Luke 21:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  </p>

<p>This is referring to our day.  In Mark 13, God tells His
people to &ldquo;speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; as we
follow His methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture.    </p>

<p>He is saying here that He is going to give His people &ldquo;a
mouth and wisdom,&rdquo; and wisdom has everything to do with discerning &ldquo;time and
judgment.&rdquo;  We read in Daniel that &ldquo;none of the wicked shall understand; but
the wise shall understand.&rdquo;  In Ecclesiastes, we read that &ldquo;a wise man&rsquo;s heart
discerneth both time and judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So in this chapter that is parallel to Matthew 24, God is
saying that He will give ability and utterance to declare the Word and wisdom
to discern &ldquo;time and judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Notice how this says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor <span class="underline">resist</span>. 
</p>

<p>Is this true?  Are the adversaries not gainsaying this?  Are
they not resisting this?  </p>

<p>No; they are in a big way, but what God means is that they
cannot do this legitimately, honestly, and Biblically.  Nobody can &ldquo;gainsay nor
resist&rdquo; this information from the Bible itself.  </p>

<p>If we go to Acts 6, we will find this word &ldquo;resist&rdquo; used in
relation to Stephen.  We read in Acts 6:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called <i>the
synagogue </i>of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them
of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. And they were not able to <span class="underline">resist</span>
the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.  </p>

<p>So they could not resist Stephen and what he was saying, but
then look at verse 11, Acts 6:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
blasphemous words against Moses, and <i>against </i>God. And they stirred up
the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon <i>him, </i>and
caught him, and brought <i>him </i>to the council, And set up false witnesses&hellip; 
</p>

<p>They did this to the point where they stoned him to death. 
They definitely resisted and gainsaid what God had given Stephen to talk about,
but they could not do this like a Berean.  They could not search the Scriptures
to show that what Stephen was saying was wrong.  This is God&rsquo;s point in Luke
21, &ldquo;I am going to give my people a mouth and wisdom, which all their
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Can they say that we are in a cult?  Yes.  Can they say that
we are heretics?  Yes.  Can they say that we are crazy or stupid or morons? 
Yes; and I am just relating some of the things that I have been called within
the last week.  Can they say these things?  Yes; yes they can.  But can they
show their conclusions from the Bible?  No.  They can repeat over and over and over,
&ldquo;No man knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  Okay; but that is only one or two verses.  Can
they show how the Bible supports this?  What about all of this other
information from the Bible that indicates that we will know, that Noah knew and
 Lot knew and Jonah knew and told the Ninevites, and so on?  What about all of
that?  These things cannot be gainsaid or resisted.  People harp on a couple of
things and think that if they repeat it enough, it is going to be so; but this
is not how it works.  Any conclusion has to be shown with the whole Bible.  </p>

<p>The following verses in Luke 21 are very interesting, but we
do not really have too much time for them.  Let us go to Luke 21:20.  We read
in Luke 21:20-22:    </p>

<p class="verse">And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
that the desolation thereof is nigh.  </p>

<p>This is the Jerusalem that represents the churches and
congregations.  This is not referring to the Jerusalem that is over in the Middle
 East.  It is not that physical city, but it is the Jerusalem that typifies the
church.  You can read Galatians 4 to see how God makes this identification.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judaea flee to
the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let
not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of
vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>This is referring to God&rsquo;s judgment on the churches and
congregations, and the command to &ldquo;depart out&rdquo;; that is, to leave the church,
to come out of the churches.  We are very familiar with this.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 21:23-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath
upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>We can compare Revelation 11:2 with this passage:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure
it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread
under foot forty <i>and </i>two months.  </p>

<p>These verses fit together.  God is describing the whole 23
years of the Great Tribulation, which is typified by &ldquo;forty <i>and </i>two
months&rdquo; or three and a half years.  In the days of Elijah, there were three and
a half years of famine, which is 42 months.  </p>

<p>Therefore, Luke 21:24 is speaking of our present Great
Tribulation and the trodding down of the nations, as Jerusalem is trodden
down:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;until the times of the [<i>nations</i>] be fulfilled.  </p>

<p>This will be on May 21<sup>st</sup>.  They continue for 42
months or for the full 23-year Great Tribulation duration.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 21:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars&hellip;  </p>

<p>What does this fit with?  This fits with Matthew 24:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven&hellip;    </p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately after the tribulation,&rdquo; these things are
happening in the heavens, except God is indicating that this is not to be
understood literally.  On May 21, the sun will not literally go dark, the moon
will not be darkened literally, and the stars are not literally going to fall. 
These things represent Christ, the Gospel, and His people.  As He takes them
out of this world on that day of resurrection, the day of the rapture, and He
brings them up into Heaven, then immediately after the tribulation,
spiritually, the sun and moon and stars have been darkened.  It has to be this
way because we know that other information tells us that there is going to be
five months of time, and timekeepers are needed to have time.  The sun, moon,
and stars will still be needed.  </p>

<p>God does not let us get this wrong.  The Bible forces us to
realize that on May 21<sup>st</sup>, immediately after the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day of judgment, spiritually the Gospel is removed because God comes for His
people.  On the other hand, the earthquake is very real and physical.  It will
literally open the ground to bring about the resurrection.  God is the One who
determines these things, not us.  We just have to carefully follow what He is
saying.  </p>

<p>So Luke 21:25 helps us to see that these things are
spiritual because it refers to them as &ldquo;signs&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then look at the second half of this verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and upon the earth <span class="underline">distress</span> of nations, with perplexity;
the sea and the waves roaring;  </p>

<p>This is what will be happening four weeks from now.  God is
going to bring judgment.  </p>

<p>Why does this say that there will be &ldquo;upon the earth distress
of nations&rdquo;?  This Greek word that was translated as &ldquo;distress&rdquo; is only found
one other place.  It says in 2 Corinthians 2:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For out of much affliction and <span class="underline">anguish</span> of heart I wrote
unto you with many tears&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;anguish&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;distress&rdquo; and it
just indicates great sorrow.  We know that this five-month period of torment is
a time of extreme sorrow for those left behind; and so upon the earth will be
anguish and &ldquo;distress of nations&rdquo; among the people of the world who were never
saved.  At that time, they will know this.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 21:25 that it is:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;with <span class="underline">perplexity</span>&hellip;</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;perplexity&rdquo; is related to another word that means
&ldquo;doubt&rdquo; or &ldquo;doubting.&rdquo;  One passage that we can look at is John 13:21-22.  This
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall
betray me. Then the disciples looked one on another, <span class="underline">doubting</span> of whom he
spake.  </p>

<p>Why is this used to describe what will be going on on the
earth in relation to mankind doubting?  People have no doubts right now.  They
are very confident that May 22<sup>nd</sup> will come, that May 21<sup>st</sup>
will be a day like any other day, that it will pass without event.  There is
great confidence in the mind of mankind, those in the world as well as those in
the church.  Those in the church have confidence that we cannot know the day or
hour.  </p>

<p>Well, when they begin to see these things happen, of course,
their confidence will be immediately shaken and they will doubt, &ldquo;What is going
on?  We thought we had it all figured out.  We thought that this world was
eternal.  We thought that this world would continue forever.  There is no way
that it could ever come to an end.  Do not tell me that those people were
right!  Do not tell me that what was being proclaimed all over the world was
correct and true!&rdquo;  Yes; it was true.  </p>

<p>Just imagine this and try to place yourself there as a
person who dismissed this.  Maybe someone in your family or in your
neighborhood had a sign up in their front lawn or maybe you heard a news
report, but you just dismissed this out of hand and now it is beginning to happen;
now this is starting over on the other side of the world.  In all probability,
this will come as a progressive earthquake, a rolling earthquake from &ldquo;nation
to nation,&rdquo; as it says in Jeremiah 25.  We read in Jeremiah 25:32-33:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of
the earth. And the slain of JEHOVAH shall be at that day from <i>one </i>end of
the earth even unto the <i>other </i>end of the earth: they shall not be
lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.  </p>

<p>The bodies of the unsaved came up from nation to nation to
nation and it is approaching where we are in our nation.  This seems to answer
a lot of questions that we had.  </p>

<p>So this is beginning and Luke 21:25 says that there is:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;distress [<i>or anguish</i>] of nations, with perplexity [<i>doubting</i>];
the sea and the waves roaring;  </p>

<p>Perhaps this will have a physical element to it, as we saw
in Japan where the ocean came into the villages and the towns.  The sea and the
waves were certainly roaring there.  But spiritually, God does liken false
prophets, those who bring other kinds of gospels, to seas and waves.  </p>

<p>Let us quickly go to one passage.  You would need to read
the context; but referring to false teaches, it says in Jude 1:13 that they are
like:  </p>

<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame&hellip;  </p>

<p>So this can have a spiritual meaning, too.  When this
happens, the teachers in the churches, the priests and the pastors, will also
be very disturbed by this, and it will be like the sea and the waves are
roaring.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 21:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
</p>

<p>On one hand, something has happened; something is going on
because there is &ldquo;distress of nations, with perplexity.&rdquo;  On the other hand,
nothing has happened because it is coming, it is approaching them, it is headed
their way.  How could we have ever understood this?  Nobody ever did, but does
this now begin to become understandable?  From nation to nation to nation,
people will be able to see this coming:    </p>

<p class="verse">Men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for fear&hellip;  </p>

<p>They are afraid because they can now see this.  Men do not
fear a declaration of Judgment Day that is even four weeks off.  I am sure that
even the day before, there will be people who do not fear.  They are not going
to be afraid.  Why should they fear?  They do not believe God.  They do not
believe the Bible.  Even in the churches, they really do not believe what God
says about there being an end to this world, about a day of resurrection and a
day of rapture.  They dismiss it with a quick flip of a verse.  They quote: &ldquo;of
that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>.&rdquo;  This will not make it go away, but
this is how they have handled this.  Now, though, this is happening; this is
the difference.  </p>

<p>Mankind has no faith, and so they cannot be like Noah and be
&ldquo;moved with fear&rdquo; in advance upon hearing this information, because they do not
have spiritual life.  They do not have spiritual eyes to see, and so they just
do not know anything about this; but the interesting thing is that there is
fear.  </p>

<p>Look at Romans 3:18.  Again, if you read the previous
verses, they give a good description of all mankind, &ldquo;There is none righteous,
no, not one.&rdquo;  &ldquo;There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
after God.&rdquo;  &ldquo;There is none that doeth good,&rdquo; and so on.  This is referring to
all people.  God knows us better than we know ourselves.  This is His analysis
and His description of the world and the people in it.  Then it says in Romans
3:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">There is no fear of God before their eyes.  </p>

<p>This is the natural state of man.  This is describing the
sinner.  They have no fear of God.  This is demonstrated all over the place as
people dismiss this with, &ldquo;This is just another Judgment Day warning.  This is
just one more prediction.&rdquo;  Then they lump this with everything else and say, &ldquo;See
you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.&rdquo;  They say that our first mistake is in believing
that old Book.  </p>

<p>They do not have a fear of God, but there is something deep
down within them to where they cannot leave this alone.  If this was really
nothing but a fairytale, this would not bother anyone; but there are a lot of
people getting upset and angry over what they think is a fairytale.  If you
watch something on television that causes you to get upset because you think
that it is ridiculous, why would you even get upset about it?  But they hear
that Judgment Day will be May 21<sup>st</sup> and all kinds of people do not
like this at all.  This is because deep down mankind knows that there is a
God.  We know that we are also liable to Him and that we are guilty before Him,
and yet they have no fear.  </p>

<p>It is interesting how the Bible speaks of fear or the fear of
God.  Let us go to Leviticus 19.  We will quickly look at a few verses.  We
read in Leviticus 19:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Leviticus 19:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head [<i>the grey head</i>],
and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>Look at Leviticus 25:17.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
thy God: for I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH your God.  </p>

<p>Look also at Leviticus 25:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
thy brother may live with thee.  </p>

<p>God gives a Law.  He tells us what to do and what not to
do.  He says that we are not to disrespect our elders, that we are to honor our
parents, and that we are to fear thy God.  </p>

<p>What He is basically saying is that when people hear His
Word, His Law, and follow it and desire to obey it, this is an example of
fearing God.  When we disregard His Word, we are not fearing God.  </p>

<p>Go to Deuteronomy 6:1-2.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now these <i>are </i>the commandments, the statutes, and the
judgments&hellip;  </p>

<p>These are all synonyms for the Bible.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;which JEHOVAH your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do
<i>them </i>in the land whither ye go to possess it: That thou mightest fear
JEHOVAH thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command
thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son&rsquo;s son, all the days of thy life; and that
thy days may be prolonged.</p>

<p>We are to fear God and obey Him.  </p>

<p>Is this not what it said in the book of Ecclesiastes when
the conclusion was reached in Ecclesiastes 12?  We read in Ecclesiastes 12:13: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
keep his commandments&hellip;  </p>

<p>So we are to fear God and keep His commandments, but look at
what is going on in the world today.  I do not even know where to start.  Where
do we start?  How about divorce?  How about marriage, divorce, remarriage, and,
in some cases, divorce again?  God says, &ldquo;They are no more twain [<i>two</i>],
but one flesh.&rdquo;  God says, &ldquo;What therefore God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder.&rdquo;  How many marriages are now estimated to end in divorce? 
Why?  The reason is because they have no fear of God.  </p>

<p>How about abortion?  God says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo;  Men
then say, &ldquo;Yes, we should not kill, but it is okay to do in a certain stage of
the pregnancy,&rdquo; and then they just make this a whole tangled mess.  Basically,
it becomes very simple and not all that difficult to justify; but this was a
human being and God says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo;  Men do not fear God, and so
they kill.  They kill by abortion or they kill by murder.  People kill in many,
many different ways.  </p>

<p>What about Sunday?  Today is Sunday and it is the Lord&rsquo;s
Day.  To the world, this is just another day for shopping and going about, the
game is on television, and this is just like any other day because they do not
fear God.  </p>

<p>How about gay pride and the homosexual movement in our day? 
To the world, this is a good and right thing.  As far as the world is
concerned, there is no problem if two people are in a committed relationship
and if they want to get married; but the Bible indicates that this is sin.  The
Bible does not matter, though, because man does not fear God.  </p>

<p>We could go to this area or that area.  Today, what has
always been in the heart of man is all over the place.  There is no fear of God
before their eyes.  </p>

<p>Judgment Day is May 21 and what do we see?  We see mocking,
reviling, and joking.  There is no fear of God at all in regards to this.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Proverbs 1.  There are so many verses that we
could read, but let us start in Proverbs 1:24.  We read in Proverbs 1:24-30:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would
none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh
as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call
upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not
find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of JEHOVAH:
They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.  </p>

<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;All scripture <i>is </i>given by
inspiration of God, and <i>is </i>profitable for&hellip;reproof.&rdquo;  They despised the
counsel and the reproof of the Word of God.  They would not fear God.  </p>

<p>God is commanding all men everywhere today to repent.  This
is the command, just like He gives us a lot of other commands.  Do you fear
God?  Are you going to obey this command or are you just going to give further
demonstration of there being no fear of God before your eyes?  If you do not
fear God in these other areas, are you going to fear God concerning repentance
before this Day comes?  </p>

<p>God says in Jeremiah 5, &ldquo;Fear ye not me?&rdquo;  Then He gives the
example of setting the bounds of the ocean, a great demonstration of the mighty
power that the whole heavens declare, and yet unsaved mankind does not fear
God.  That is fine; but as we read in Proverbs 1:26-27, &ldquo;Your fear cometh.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what Luke 21:26 is telling us:  </p>

<p class="verse">Men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
</p>

<p>Their hearts are failing them for fear for what they see
coming on the earth; it has begun.  </p>

<p>Look at Revelation 18.  Again, there is a lot here that we
could read, but we read in Revelation 18:8-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong <i>is
</i>the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who have
committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and
lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, Standing afar off
for the fear of her torment&hellip;  </p>

<p>They see it begin, they have also heard about the five
months, and now they are afraid.  There are also other verses that indicate
that it will be at that point that men will want to bless God.  </p>

<p>It will be like the rich man in torments in Luke 16 who
basically is crying out, &ldquo;Send Lazarus with a drop of water on his finger so
that I can lick it from his finger, just a drop.  I do not even need the whole
Gospel.  Just send the slightest little portion.&rdquo;  If those left behind were to
see a tract in a rain puddle, they would be crying out for just that one little
section of Scripture that could be seen, &ldquo;Just give me that one little verse of
Scripture, that one possibility that I might be delivered out of torments, that
I might be taken up to Heaven where I can see Lazarus in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom.  I
can see him.  I saw him go up.  I know that he is up there, but I am now in
torment and it is now that I want this Gospel.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This will also be like Esau who did not care about the
blessing before.  Once it was given to Jacob, then he wanted to know, &ldquo;Hast
thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <i>even </i>me also.&rdquo;  What is this
blessing?  Psalm 133 says, &ldquo;The LORD commanded the blessing, <i>even </i>life
for evermore.&rdquo;  God is just telling us here that if we do not fear Him now, we will;
we will.  </p>

<p>Look at Revelation 11:12-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
up hither&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the rapture.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies
beheld them.  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand:
and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Isaiah 2.  I think that we will be able to
pinpoint exactly when this will take place.  We read in Isaiah 2:10-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of JEHOVAH,
and for the glory of his majesty. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and
the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and JEHOVAH alone shall be exalted
in that day. For the day of JEHOVAH of hosts <i>shall be </i>upon every <i>one
that is </i>proud and lofty, and upon every <i>one that is </i>lifted up; and
he shall be brought low: And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, <i>that are </i>high
and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, And upon all the high
mountains, and upon all the hills <i>that are </i>lifted up, And upon every
high tower, and upon every fenced wall, And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and
upon all pleasant pictures. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and
the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and JEHOVAH alone shall be exalted in
that day. And the idols he shall utterly abolish. And they shall go into the
holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of JEHOVAH, and
for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. In
that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which
they made <i>each one </i>for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for
fear of JEHOVAH, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake
terribly the earth.  </p>

<p>There will be a lot of the fear of the Lord then; quite a
bit.  Notice that they are getting rid of their idols.  They are throwing them
all away.  All of the idolatry that the Bible says, &ldquo;God winked at; but now
commandeth all men every where to repent.&rdquo;  They have not repented; but in that
day, they will try to repent.  Then they will try to do what God had said.  </p>

<p>Look at this language.  They are &ldquo;humbled.&rdquo;  They are &ldquo;brought
low.&rdquo;  They have the fear of the Lord, the fear of Jehovah; but what good is
it?  What good will this be on the day that God rises &ldquo;to shake terribly the earth&rdquo;? 
This will be that &ldquo;great earthquake&rdquo; that the Bible tells us is coming, and
this will come from land to land and from &ldquo;nation to nation.&rdquo;  Mankind will see
this; they will behold it and they will see all of the people of God going up. 
</p>

<p>So there will be fear upon the unsaved when this day comes,
but notice what it says back in Luke 21:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when these things begin to come to pass&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of when it begins.  We know that this is
going to happen now, but there is further verification when this actually does
happen.  This is like when God&rsquo;s people knew the Messiah would come, but then
He came.  </p>

<p>We know when Judgment Day will be and it is a wonder to see
God fulfill His Word precisely, and so when it begins to come to pass:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
draweth nigh.  </p>

<p>It is not here yet.  You will see this come to pass, but you
will still have to wait, just like the unsaved will have to wait in great
fear.  Their hearts will be failing them for fear; but the believer on the
other hand is not to fear.  God is saying not to fear and not to worry.  We are
to be comforted and encouraged.  At that point, we are to look up.  </p>

<p>This is as He tells us in Psalm 46.  We read in Psalm
46:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<i> Though </i>the waters
thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof. Selah.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people are not to fear this.  We have lived our lives
in the fear of the Lord.  Now, at this point, there will be no more fear, just
a confident security.  </p>

<p>Wow!  We are so busy now that we cannot even think about
this.  We are so busy trying to get the Gospel message to everyone, but we are
literally days away from the fulfillment of all things that the Bible has said
and of receiving an everlasting body.  </p>

<p>There will be a few more days of sorrow, sowing the seed in
sorrow, but then we will reap in joy.  This is what the Bible indicates.  At
that time, we can just look up into Heaven and it will be finished.  For us, everything
in this world will be done.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
