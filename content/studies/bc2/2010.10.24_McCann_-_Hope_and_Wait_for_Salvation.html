  This message refers to Lamentations 3:26, "It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD."
---
<p>I would like to turn to Lamentations 3.  This is a book that
the Lord moved Jeremiah to write.  We will begin in verse 21.  We read in
Lamentation 3:21-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.<i> It is of </i>JEHOVAH&rsquo;S
mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<i> They are
</i>new every morning: great <i>is </i>thy faithfulness. JEHOVAH <i>is </i>my
portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. JEHOVAH <i>is </i>good
unto them that wait for him, to the soul <i>that </i>seeketh him.<i> It is </i>good
that <i>a man </i>should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of
JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This is a passage that has really been a comfort and an
encouragement to the people of God for a long time throughout the centuries. 
God is telling us, the reader, to hope.  He is telling us to hope.  </p>

<p>Looking ahead to May 21, 2011, many people are not sure of
their salvation.  Of course, there are some who have assurance; yet there are
many others who are not sure of their own salvation.  They are not sure if God
has saved them and where they stand with God; however, they do hope.  They do
have hope.  </p>

<p>Look at it this way.  God has opened up the Scriptures and
revealed many truths to people.  Some people are not resisting this.  They are
not fighting against God regarding the information that He is opening up.  They
understand and recognize that these things are true, &ldquo;Yes, it is true concerning
the end of the church age.&rdquo;  This is a truth that they recognize.  They also
recognize that God&rsquo;s judgment process is not what they had thought and that,
instead, God intends to utterly destroy and annihilate the sinner.  They say, &ldquo;Yes,
I understand this.&rdquo;  They also understand that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  They are not fighting against this or resisting this in any way.  They also understand
that God saves by the &ldquo;faith of Christ&rdquo; and not by their own faith; and they understand
the five months of torment.  </p>

<p>They understand all of these things, but they also
understand that knowledge does not save.  They understand that knowledge or
correct doctrine does not save anyone.  They realize that an individual could
know these things intellectually, and yet this does not mean that they are
saved.  </p>

<p>What is the Bible&rsquo;s definition for Biblical understanding? 
Turn to Job 28:28, where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <i>is </i>wisdom;
and to depart from evil <i>is </i>understanding.  </p>

<p>So this goes beyond what we think or what we agree with.  It
goes beyond what we understand with our minds.  It must translate into a fear
of God.  The fact that we are continuing in sin, even though we have an
understanding of these things, is really telling us that we do not understand
in the way in which God indicates that His people will understand, as it says
in Daniel 12:10:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the wise shall understand.</p>

<p>Yes, part of this understanding is what happens in our
minds.  We understand it.  We see it intellectually.  We agree with it.  We
know it.  However, there has to also be action.  There has to be some action in
our lives.  There has to be a turning from our sin in repentance.  </p>

<p>We also understand repentance at this time.  God&rsquo;s people
know that they cannot repent satisfactorily enough to please God.  Right?  I
hope that we understand this.  God commands us, &ldquo;Repent ye: for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand,&rdquo; and we should do all that we can to turn away from sin.  We
should turn away from whatever sin we see in our lives.  We should turn away
from lying or cursing or stealing or drinking or smoking.  We should turn away
from whatever it is, but we should never think that turning away from these
things is salvation.  It is nothing but a step in the right direction.  </p>

<p>The Ninevites did this.  They turned &ldquo;from the violence that
[<i>was</i>]<i> </i>in their hands,&rdquo; but they did not think that this saved
them.  They cried &ldquo;mightily unto God&rdquo; because they said, &ldquo;Who can tell <i>if </i>God
will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>So they believed God through the prophet Jonah, and they
took action.  They began crying out to God, sitting in sackcloth and ashes and
fasting.  This impacted their lives.  It stopped them in the way in which they
were going.  </p>

<p>In this we see an intellectual understanding coupled with
right actions as they went to God.  Of course, God is the One who would have to
bring this about in anyone&rsquo;s life.  </p>

<p>But God&rsquo;s people are made to be honest with themselves,
because God gives them a spirit that has &ldquo;no guile.&rdquo;  If you remember, Jesus
said this of Nathanael, &ldquo;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We do not want false salvation.  We do not want false
assurance.  This is the problem with the churches.  If we wanted false
security, we would stay in the church and follow their method.  By doing so, we
could guarantee our salvation, except for the fact that this would be false. 
This is not true salvation.  </p>

<p>So for the ones whom God is really dealing with, they do not
want any kind of falsehood.  This causes us to take the Bible seriously when
God tells us to &ldquo;Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith&rdquo;; and when we
look at ourselves honestly, we do see sin.  This troubles us, but all of these
other things are in place and we are hoping that God will save us, that He will
deliver us.  </p>

<p>God has some very good things to say about people who hope
in His mercy.  He has some excellent things to say about those who are waiting
on Him.  Waiting on Him and hoping go hand in hand.  They are waiting on Him to
do the work.  They are waiting on Him to take the action in granting
assurance.  Is this not what the Bible says?  </p>

<p>Do you remember Psalm 35?  I like this verse because it
really says a lot.  We read in Psalm 35:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way </i>against them
that persecute me&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a Psalm of David and God is moving him to write
this, but this is also a prayer from David.  It is a prayer of a child of God. 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation.  </p>

<p>That is, &ldquo;You, God, speak to my soul and say, &lsquo;I am thy
salvation.&rsquo;&rdquo;  In other words, &ldquo;You convince me.  You do it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>People read, &ldquo;Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the
faith,&rdquo; as it says in 2 Corinthians 13; and so they look at themselves and,
perhaps, they see some change in their lives.  Maybe they have been able to get
away from a couple of sins, and so they intellectually agree with a lot of
these things.  </p>

<p>The problem arises when they say, &ldquo;You know what?  I
examined myself.  I looked at myself through the mirror of the Word of God and
I think that I am saved.  I do think that I am saved.&rdquo;  From this point on,
they will tell others, &ldquo;I am saved.  I am a child of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What is the problem?  What is the problem with this?  Who is
saying this to their spirit?  They are saying this to themselves.  They are
telling themselves, &ldquo;I am saved.&rdquo;  But the Bible says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation.  </p>

<p>Look at Romans 8.  Romans 8:15-16 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The
Spirit&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is referring to God the Holy Spirit, and so it says in
Romans 8:16:    </p>

<p class="verse">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
the children of God:  </p>

<p>How does God&rsquo;s Spirit &ldquo;bear witness&rdquo; to our spirit?  The
Bible says, &ldquo;Faith <i>cometh </i>by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So as we read the Bible and as we pray and as we cry out for
mercy, it would be an excellent prayer to say, &ldquo;O Lord, speak to my soul that
You are my salvation.  May You convince me.  May You give me assurance of
salvation.  I do not ever want to do this myself.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We say this because of what we read in Jeremiah 17:9, which
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heart <i>is </i>deceitful above all <i>things, </i>and desperately
wicked&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is our heart.  Something that is deceitful is like a
con man.  A con man is someone who is deceitful.  Someone who is a liar is
someone who is being deceitful.  Satan is deceitful; so is man.  We are born
liars.  We are conceived in sin.  </p>

<p>Do you remember what God says of a baby?  He says that a
baby is &ldquo;born, speaking lies.&rdquo;  This is relating to all of mankind; and so how
do you trust yourself?  How could you ever trust yourself?  </p>

<p>God does not want us to trust ourselves.  He does not want
this.  He says instead, &ldquo;Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith&rdquo;; but
as we do self-examination, it should bring us to the point of recognizing that
we can never know ourselves.  Yes, we can know ourselves better than anyone else
can know us.  The Bible says, &ldquo;For what man knoweth the things of a man, save
the spirit of man which is in him?&rdquo;  But no one really knows us, not even our
wife or our husband, our mother or our father.  No one knows what is really
going on within the mind or the heart of a person.  </p>

<p>This is why when someone goes crazy and kills half a dozen
people, the neighbors often say, &ldquo;He was such a nice guy.  He was such a good
guy.  I never would have expected this of him.&rdquo;  This is because we cannot know
one another.  We only know what comes out of our mouths and the things that we
do.  We can get an idea from these things; but even in this, people are still
often fooled by what others are capable of whom they thought that they knew. 
Even you or I, any one of us, we do not know ourselves as well as we think we
might.  </p>

<p>Look at Jeremiah 17:9 again.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heart <i>is </i>deceitful above all <i>things, </i>and
desperately wicked: who can know it?  </p>

<p>We cannot know it.  Deep down in the subconscious, deep down
in our hearts, if we were put in a certain position or into a certain situation
in our lives, would we be any different than the guards at concentration camps
who were placed in positions because of the way in which things unfolded in Germany? 
</p>

<p>Maybe some would.  Maybe someone would never do things like
they did; but until tested, we do not know what we are capable of in our sinful
condition.  </p>

<p>So when God commands, &ldquo;Examine yourselves,&rdquo; our response
should be, &ldquo;Okay, Lord.  I will look at what I can.  I will look to see what I
can see about myself.&rdquo;  Ultimately, though, in the command to examine
ourselves, we fall short.  </p>

<p>It is just like every other command.  We are commanded to
believe.  Well, we can believe to a certain degree, but we fall short of
believing unto salvation.  We are commanded to repent.  We can repent to a
certain degree, but we fall short of repentance unto salvation.  We are also commanded
to examine ourselves, and we fall short.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 10, Jeremiah 17:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">I JEHOVAH search the heart, <i>I </i>try the reins&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is where we need to go.  &ldquo;O Lord, I want to be sure.  I
want to know if I am saved or not, but I do not trust myself.  I do not trust
myself.  How do I know that I am really a child of God?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are living in a world of over two billion professing Christians
who are in the churches and who do not understand what God is saying.  If they
remain, they will be bundled as tares for the burning.  </p>

<p>This means that over two billion people are deceived.  Their
hearts have deceived them into thinking that they are right with God when they
are not.  Since this is a day of great deception, how could we ever trust
ourselves?  What are we to do then?  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 139:23-24.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
And see if <i>there be any </i>wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
everlasting.  </p>

<p>So we go to God and we cry to Him, &ldquo;You complete the search.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>This would be similar to me trying to find a virus on my
computer.  With my limited knowledge in technical things, I would never get to
the root of where a virus would have hidden itself in the files of my
computer.  However, I could have an expert look at it or I could purchase
software that runs a virus check; then it would be found.   </p>

<p>Basically, this is the idea.  We are so complex, we do not
know what is going on deep-down within us; and so we can pray to the Lord, &ldquo;O
Lord, I started the search, but I have to give this up at this point to You. 
You continue searching.  Look in me and lead me in the way everlasting.  Save
me.  Save me, O Lord, and make sure that I am not going in any wicked way.&rdquo; 
This is what God would have us to do.  </p>

<p>Can God give true repentance?  Yes.  Can He give faith? 
Yes.  Can He give assurance of salvation?  Yes, He can.  </p>

<p>Have you ever asked Him?  Have you ever asked Him, &ldquo;O Lord,
have mercy on me.  I know that You can save me even right now, O God, but could
You please say to my soul, &lsquo;I am thy salvation&rsquo;?  Can Your Spirit testify and
speak to my soul and witness to my soul that I might know that I am a child of
God, as it says in Romans 8?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why not pray this way?  Why not pray that God give us the
assurance so that we know, especially as this Day is approaching?   </p>

<p>So this is what I wanted to talk about, as we read in
Lamentations 3:26:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>It is </i>good that <i>a man </i>should both hope and quietly
wait for&hellip;salvation&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a really good verse.  There are good verses in relation
to this in Lamentations 3. </p>

<p>So God tells us to wait and to hope, to wait and to hope;
but at the same time, there is an urgency.  Is this not true?  There is a great
urgency right now because we have so little time left.  We have just a short
while and the Day of Judgment will be here.  </p>

<p>God tells us in 2 Corinthians 6:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">We then, <i>as </i>workers together <i>with him, </i>beseech <i>you
</i>also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith, I have
heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured
thee: behold, now <i>is </i>the accepted time; behold, now <i>is </i>the day of
salvation.)  </p>

<p>It is today.  Today is the time.  It is not next week.  It
is certainly not May of 2011.  </p>

<p>What a wonderful blessing we have today that we can cry to
God and we can beseech Him.  If it is as though there is just silence or if it
seems that God is ignoring us, we can always think, &ldquo;Yes, but I have tomorrow. 
I have tomorrow.  Thank God that there is tomorrow and that it is the day of
salvation tomorrow.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we can still go to Him, but we cannot demand that He save
us.  This could be a temptation.  This could be an urge that we have, &ldquo;God! 
Save me now!  Save me!  You must!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But this is not how we go to God.  We have to go to Him
humbly and we have to go in a very contrite way.  We go to Him and say, &ldquo;O
Lord, may You have mercy.  I know that You have saved people from the
foundation of the world.  Before the foundation of the world, You paid for
their sins; but I do not know if I am one of them.  Could it be that You would
have mercy on me and save me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It may be that nothing happens, just like the Canaanite
woman.  She went to the Lord and besought Him and He ignored her.  I love these
verses in Matthew 15, because how many times have you prayed when it seemed
like nothing happened?  Did God even hear?  </p>

<p>In Matthew 15:21-23, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
  Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried
unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou </i>son of David; my
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word&hellip;  </p>

<p>Is this not amazing?  Now, put yourself in her place.  She
had been hearing incredible things about this Prophet who certainly, by all of
the miracles He had been doing, very well could be the Messiah.  As she must
have thought about this, many said that He was the Messiah.  He had all this
power.  He made the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame
to walk, the dead to rise.  He had done all of these miracles; and so she must
have thought, &ldquo;My daughter is grievously vexed.  I love my daughter so much,
and so I will go to Him.  I have heard nothing but good things about Him.  I
have heard of His great compassion, mercy, and grace; so I will go to Him and
just lay it all out.&rdquo;  She even called Him the &ldquo;son of David,&rdquo; which was in
recognition that He is the Messiah.  She cried, &ldquo;O Thou Son of David, have
mercy on me!  Have mercy,&rdquo; and the Bible says that He answered her not a word. 

</p>

<p>If you talk to someone, especially if you are pouring out
your heart, and they do not say anything back and just walk away, would this
not be rude?  Yet there was Christ, the Saviour.  She came to Him and poured
out her heart, and He did not say a word.  </p>

<p>Have you prayed and poured out your heart and it seemed like
there was no response?  Well, did Christ hear her?  He heard her.  Did He have
a plan for her?  Yes, He did have a plan for her.  He wanted to use her as an
example of great multitudes, probably, of the people of God who have gone to
Him over the course of history and besought Him for their own salvation or
besought Him for the salvation of their children or the salvation of their
family, when it seemed, at first, that there was no response from God.  Some
people may even wonder, &ldquo;O Lord, are You hearing me?  Are You hearing me?&rdquo; 
But, yes; yes, He heard and yet He ignored her.  </p>

<p>Why do you think that He did this?  Why would Jesus ignore
her?  We have other instances where He immediately granted someone&rsquo;s request. 
Immediately, He could perform a miracle; however, not in this case.  Why not?  </p>

<p>We know the story.  We know that He is going to heal her
daughter, but He did not answer her a word because He was testing her.  He
wants us to know this, too.  The test was, &ldquo;You come to Me and you understand
that I am merciful.  You understand that I am the Messiah, that I am the
Saviour and that I have the power to heal you, but I will do this in My own
time, if I do it at all.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now, how are you going to respond?  Are you going to get
angry?  Are you going to get upset and stomp your feet and walk away?  Are you
going to respond with, &ldquo;Huh; some compassionate Saviour; some gracious God He
is!  He did not listen to me; He did not even acknowledge that I was there&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Well, on one hand, Jesus is holding her off, while on the
other hand, He is drawing her to Himself.  She did not go away angry, nor did
she go away discouraged.  She knew that if her daughter was to get well, He was
her only hope, which is just like God&rsquo;s people who know today that there is
nowhere else to go.  There is nowhere to go.  </p>

<p>Are you going to go to the church?  Are you going to find
salvation in the church?  Are you going to go to the world and its
philosophies?  Are you going to find some religion somewhere?  Are you going to
go and dip yourself in the Ganges River, which is a filthy and polluted river
that never cleansed anyone?  Where can you go?  </p>

<p>You go to God because He is the One who has the words of
eternal life; and so you pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I am coming to You and I am going to
wait.  I am going to wait on You.  I am going to hope in You because I know
what You are like and that You delight in mercy.  You are very merciful, which
I do not deserve at all, and so I am going to wait on You and on Your timing.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>It continues on in Matthew 15:23 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  </p>

<p>They saw that Jesus was not paying any attention to her, but
they made a wrong assumption that He had no interest in her.  Therefore, they
said, &ldquo;Send her away.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We then read in Matthew 15:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.  </p>

<p>Who are amongst the &ldquo;lost sheep&rdquo;?  Is it only the Jews?  No;
it is people from all over the world, people from all nations, Gentile and Jew;
but the Jews had a wrong understanding about this.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 15:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he
answered and said&hellip;    </p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Okay; I will help you.&rdquo;  Right?  No; He did not
say this.  It continues:    </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children&rsquo;s
bread, and cast <i>it </i>to dogs.  </p>

<p>So He stopped ignoring her, but now He is insulting her by
calling her a dog.  A dog was an unclean animal.  He tells her that it was not
meet to take the bread for the people of God, the children&rsquo;s bread, and to cast
it to dogs.  </p>

<p>Can you see how Christ is pushing her away?  He could very
well be doing the same thing with you.  He could be pushing you away.  You
could be getting very frustrated and tired and you may even feel like
fainting.  </p>

<p>What does God say in the Gospel of Luke?  If you remember,
He says in Luke 18:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint;  </p>

<p>Keep praying.  Keep going to Him.  Keep beseeching Him for
mercy and do not faint.  </p>

<p>Here in Luke 18, we have the example of the widow and the &ldquo;unjust
judge.&rdquo;  We read that her continual coming to him wearied him so that he
granted her request.  This is what God is saying.  How much more will He, who
is a just judge, grant the request of His elect people?  So He tells us to keep
coming.  We are to keep coming.  </p>

<p>Remember what we read in Luke 11.  In Luke 11, we have the
account of a man who goes to his friend at midnight.  We read in Luke 11:5-10: 
</p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; For
a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before
him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now
shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say
unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet
because of his importunity&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, because of his persistence.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I say unto
you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  </p>

<p>Is this all that we have to do?  We just have to ask God,
right?  We just have to seek Him.  This is what many say today, &ldquo;Seek the Lord
and you will be saved,&rdquo; and then they go to Romans 10; because in Romans 10:9,
it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved.  </p>

<p>The key statement here is &ldquo;believe in thine heart.&rdquo;  We are
to believe in our hearts, but our hearts are dead.  The heart is dead; it is a
stony heart, &ldquo;an evil heart of unbelief.&rdquo;  You should not count on your heart. 
You need a new heart and then you can believe.  It is then that your confession
will match your heart.  This is what God is looking for.  </p>

<p>We continue on to read in Romans 10:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever
believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the
Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon
him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  </p>

<p>Again, this is what is commonly presented to people, &ldquo;Here
is what you have to do.  Call upon the Lord and you will be saved.  It says it
right here.&rdquo;  However, the problem is that man cannot call upon the name of the
Lord.   </p>

<p>Isaiah 64:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>there is </i>none that calleth upon thy name, that
stirreth up himself to take hold of thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>God commands us to call on His name and then we will be
saved, but then He gives us other information that none can.  None can do this,
not in the way in which God means it.  For instance, God says, &ldquo;Seek, and ye
shall find,&rdquo; but what is the Biblical definition of seeking?  </p>

<p>If we go to Deuteronomy 4:29, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But if from thence thou shalt seek JEHOVAH thy God, thou shalt
find him&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is exactly as it says in the Gospels, &ldquo;Seek, and ye
shall find&rdquo;; but look at the rest of the verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<span class="underline">if</span> thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy
soul.  </p>

<p>This is the condition.  Apart from God saving someone and
giving them this kind of a heart, has anyone sought God with all of their heart
and with all of their soul?  No; no one can do this.  At best, we seek God with
a certain low percentage of our hearts.  Actually, most probably, we are at 0%,
because the seeking is really just something that we think that we are doing.  God
says that true seeking would be with all of one&rsquo;s heart and with all of one&rsquo;s
soul.  Since none can do this, He therefore says in Romans 3, &ldquo;There is none
that seeketh after God.&rdquo;  None seek Him because no one can do this with all of
their heart and with all of their soul.  </p>

<p>Let us go to a couple more verses.  I just wanted to
emphasize some things because we are right at the edge of the end of the
world.  Because of this, there is tremendous pressure being placed upon
everyone to obtain salvation.  There is tremendous pressure.  </p>

<p>This is similar to when the Israelites came out of Egypt and
they were right up against the Red Sea.  They had Pharaoh and his army after
them and then they had a sea in front of them, which was impossible for them to
cross.  There they were and they needed a miracle.  </p>

<p>This is exactly the situation that we are in.  If we are to
find safety and deliverance and enter into Heaven, we have to get through the Red
 Sea to get to the Promised Land.  We cannot do this ourselves.  </p>

<p>The problem in today&rsquo;s churches is that they believe that we
can do this ourselves.  Because of this, they teach a freewill Gospel.  This
causes people to wonder, &ldquo;If it is up to me and I can get myself saved at any
point I want to by accepting Christ, then why do I have to wait on God?  What
is the sense of hoping and waiting quietly on God if I can get myself saved
today?  All I have to do is take steps one, two, and three.  I have to
recognize that I am a sinner.  I have to say the sinner&rsquo;s prayer.  Then I have
to walk down the aisle and accept Christ.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So why in the world did God write something like
Lamentations 3 or why did He write what we read in Psalm 130?  It says in Psalm
130:5-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">I wait for JEHOVAH, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
hope. My soul <i>waiteth </i>for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning: <i>I say, more than </i>they that watch for the morning. Let Israel
hope in JEHOVAH: for with JEHOVAH<i> there is </i>mercy, and with him <i>is </i>plenteous
redemption.  </p>

<p>Why wait?  Why wait, as it says in Psalm 123?  We read in
Psalm 123:1-4?  </p>

<p class="verse">Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
heavens. Behold, as the eyes of servants <i>look </i>unto the hand of their
masters, <i>and </i>as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
our eyes <i>wait </i>upon JEHOVAH<i> </i>our God, until that he have mercy upon
us. Have mercy upon us, O JEHOVAH, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly
filled with contempt. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those
that are at ease, <i>and </i>with the contempt of the proud.  </p>

<p>Why would I have to wait when what is taught in the churches
is that I can do this today?  The problem is that the Bible does not teach
this.  The Bible says to &ldquo;wait on the LORD.&rdquo;  The Bible says to &ldquo;hope in his
mercy.&rdquo;  We are to wait for Him to act.  </p>

<p>As far as free will, Jesus said in John 15:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you&hellip;  </p>

<p>Does this not answer the question?  Do we choose Christ?  Do
we accept Him?  No; Jesus says, &ldquo;I have chosen you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Or look at John 1:12.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, <i>even </i>to them that believe on his name: </p>

<p>So He is talking about belief.  Many pastors quote this
verse to show that you have to believe, but they forget the next verse.  It
says in John 1:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which were born&hellip;   </p>

<p>John 3 speaks of being &ldquo;born again.&rdquo;  This is what is in
view here.  John 1:13 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which were born, not of blood&hellip;  </p>

<p>No one becomes a child of God because of their ancestry or
their lineage or who their father was.  This does not matter.  It is &ldquo;not of
blood.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember that the context of this is believing and being
born again.  Someone is not born again, in other words, by the will of man. 
This is very definite.  God is saying to those who say that man has a free will
that this is not so in the case of salvation.  A person&rsquo;s free will will never
save them.  We are not born again by the will of man.  </p>

<p>How are we born again?  We are born again, as John 1:13 ends
with:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but of God.  </p>

<p>Another way that the Bible says this is &ldquo;salvation <i>is </i>of
the LORD.&rdquo;  He also says, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; God says; it
is not man&rsquo;s will.  There is no possibility that salvation is based on man&rsquo;s
will.  </p>

<p>This is why the disciples were shocked after the rich man
had gone away and Jesus had told them that it was impossible for a man to enter
into the Kingdom of God.  He said, &ldquo;With men this is impossible; but with God
all things are possible.&rdquo;  This is where salvation is.  It is in God.  It is
not in us.  We can never obtain it through our own works or through our own
efforts.  </p>

<p>To finish, let us go to Luke 14, which is a parable that Christ
gave that I think is very important for us today.  We read in Luke 14:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, When thou art
bidden of any <i>man </i>to a wedding&hellip;  </p>

<p>God likens His salvation plan to being invited to a wedding. 
Do you remember the man who went into the wedding but did not have on the
proper garment?  Spiritually, this would be Christ&rsquo;s robe of righteousness,
that &ldquo;pure and white linen&rdquo; of the saints.  He did not have this, and so they
bound him &ldquo;hand and foot&rdquo; and he was &ldquo;cast into outer darkness.&rdquo;  In a sense,
we are all bidden to this wedding.  </p>

<p>Luke 14:8 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">When thou art bidden of any <i>man </i>to a wedding, sit not
down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of
him;  </p>

<p>What would this be referring to if you are bidden to a
wedding and you go and sit down in the highest room?  The key word here is &ldquo;highest&rdquo;
because God likens pride to those who lift themselves up.  Humility is likened
to those who are brought low; they are &ldquo;lowly.&rdquo;  Jesus was &ldquo;meek and lowly in
heart,&rdquo; and so He was of great humility.  </p>

<p>In terms of the Gospel, how could someone lift themselves up
to a very high place?  How could someone take the highest room?  How could
someone do this?  What happens upon salvation?  If someone says, &ldquo;I accepted Christ
and I became saved,&rdquo; what are they actually saying?  Where did they go?  </p>

<p>Ephesians 2:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And hath raised <i>us </i>up together, and made <i>us </i>sit
together in heavenly [<i>heavenlies</i>] in Christ Jesus:  </p>

<p>Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father in Heaven. 
When someone says, &ldquo;I accepted Him, and so I am born again; I can tell you the
day and the year when I accepted Him,&rdquo; what they are basically saying is, &ldquo;At
that point, I was lifted up into Heaven itself and exalted on high in Christ.&rdquo; 
However, this is pride.  This is pride because they think that they did it
all.  They did it all.  They lifted themselves up by their own action, by their
own will, by their own work; but God does not accept any of this.  </p>

<p>In the book of Obadiah, in Obadiah 1:3-4, the Lord says in
relation to Edom or Esau, who is a picture of those who are in the corporate
churches and not truly saved:    </p>

<p class="verse">The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee&hellip;</p>

<p>We were talking about the deception of our hearts earlier.  The
pride of man&rsquo;s heart has deceived him.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation <i>is
</i>high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? Though
thou exalt <i>thyself </i>as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the
stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This is what will happen on May 21<sup>st</sup>, the Day of
Judgment.  God will rapture His people, He will resurrect His people to life,
and He will take them up; and it will be the lowly ones, those poor beggars.  </p>

<p>Just look at how much reproach God&rsquo;s people experience in
this world.  We are the &ldquo;offscouring&rdquo; of the world.  We are the lowest in the
eyes of the world.  We are lowly esteemed.  This is true especially if you are
standing on a corner and handing out tracts, or if you are holding a sign, or
if you have anything to do with Judgment Day and you are putting forth a date. 

</p>

<p>Anyone who has experienced this to any degree knows how this
is received by some.  By some, it is not very highly esteemed at all; and yet
God indicates that He is going to bring down Esau or all those who thought that
they were saved but never were.  On that Day, He will lift up His people.  </p>

<p>We read in Revelation 11:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld
them.  </p>

<p>Where are the enemies of God?  They are down below.  God&rsquo;s
people go up.  The enemies remain down on the earth, which is quite a distance from
Heaven up above.  The enemies are made low.  </p>

<p>If we go back to the parable in Luke 14 again, God had just
warned about taking the highest seat.  Then we read in Luke 14:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.   </p>

<p>May 21<sup>st</sup> will be a great day of shame.  It will
be the exposure of the sins of man.  It will be God judging man, and a big part
of this judgment will be the shame that they were never able to feel for their
sins that they committed in God&rsquo;s sight.  At this point, God will be making the
sins of man known and His judgment known.  This will be those who had exalted
themselves to Heaven in Christ but who will then be shown to have never been
saved.  They will be left behind where they will remain upon the earth.  They will
be made low.  </p>

<p>Then Luke 14:10-11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher:
then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with
thee. For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth
himself shall be exalted.  </p>

<p>This is a Biblical principle.  If we lift ourselves up in
any way, God will bring us down.  However, it would seem that God would be
pleased with anyone who hears the Gospel and who agrees with it and says, &ldquo;O
Lord, I understand all of these things that You are saying and I believe them,
but I do not know if I am saved.  I know that because I am a sinner, this means
that Your wrath could be upon me and that I might be destroyed.  I am
continuing to head towards this very Day with this understanding, but I just do
not have 100% confidence that I am a child of God; yet I hope in Your mercy.  I
wait upon You to speak the Word to my soul.  I wait for You to lift me up into
Heaven and to save me.  Though You slay me, I will trust in You.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I think that God would be pleased with those who take this
position, this low room.  Day after day, they are not going to run away.  They
are not going to try to lift themselves up in any way, shape, or form.  They
are just going to wait on the Lord.  It would seem that God would be pleased
with anyone who is doing this.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
