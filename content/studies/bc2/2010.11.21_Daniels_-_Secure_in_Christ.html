<p>One of the things that I would like to talk about today is
that God gives the true believer many assurances in the Bible.  When we truly become
a child of God, when God has done a work of salvation in someone&rsquo;s heart and we
are truly saved, God has given us many assurances in the Bible that we are safe
and secure in Christ.  It is a wonderful thing to know that when God has truly
saved us, we are saved eternally.  </p>

<p>As true believers, we desire this also for our loved ones. 
Our heart goes out to them.  It makes it more difficult if we have to live with
someone who is unsaved.  We can see their rebellion against God and this
grieves the true believer; but we know that we are secure in Christ and that we
do not have to be afraid of May 21, 2011.  Many people are worried about this,
but the true believer has nothing to worry about.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a beautiful passage in 1 Corinthians 15.  We
do not have to be afraid of the earthquake that will come on that day, an
earthquake like this earth has never seen before.  We do not have to fear this
earthquake, because God is in control.  God tells us here in 1 Corinthians
15:51-52:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep&hellip;  </p>

<p>There are going to be plenty of true believers here and still
living when God comes who had never died physically, and so He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye&hellip;  </p>

<p>Whether the true believer experiences a second of this
earthquake, or whatever it could be, we do not have to fear this day.  Those
who are not saved should fear this day.  They should be terrified of it, and
yet God tells us in the Bible that unsaved man does not fear God.  When you
give them this information about May 21, it does not register.  It just goes
right over their heads.  Some laugh at it.  Some scoff at it.  But for the true
believer, there is nothing to fear about this day, nothing at all.  Even if we
experience a second of the earthquake, we will be changed at the snap of a
finger.  We will be in our glorified spiritual bodies and we are going to be
caught up to be with Christ.  </p>

<p>For the wicked, the ones who remain, they should be
terrified, though they may not fear now.  On Judgment Day, which will be on May
21, they will fear and they will be very frightened.  This is because we are
talking about Almighty God who is going to turn His attention to punishing
those who are left behind.  They will fear, but all hope will be gone then and
there will be no possibility of salvation.  At that point, unsaved man is going
to have to face the wrath of Almighty God.  </p>

<p>What will this be like?  We do not know.  All we know is
that this is going to be horrible, because when we look at Psalm 2:4, which is
just one verse among many that addresses this, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have
them in derision.  </p>

<p>It is going to be a terrible time for those left behind to
face the wrath of God.  At that point, this world is going to become hell.  It
is going to be nothing but a curse.  It is a curse even now, but there are
still blessings.  </p>

<p>On May 21<sup>st</sup>, where are you going to find food to
eat?  Where are you going to find all of these physical things that you need,
these physical blessings from God?  They will no longer be here.  God will then
be finished with mankind, so to speak, even though He will not be completely
finished with mankind until October 21<sup>st</sup>.  At that point, He will be
done with mankind and He will pour out His wrath.  </p>

<p>It is easy for us to see the devastation that an earthquake
will bring.  If you want to frighten unsaved man, put him through an
earthquake.  He thinks that he is not afraid, but let an earthquake strike Delaware
and see what happens.  Let the earth start to shake and unsaved man will be
beside himself.  He will see all of his hopes and dreams come crashing down on
him.  He will stand there in fear because all of his dreams and aspirations are
in this life.  We know that on that Day of Judgment, he will be afraid.  There
will be no hope for him then.  </p>

<p>Let us turn over to Romans where God gives the true
believers great assurances.  God just goes on and on and on about how safe we
are in Christ when God has given someone a new heart.  When He has saved
someone, they are safe and secure in Christ.  This is a familiar passage.  He
tells us in Romans 8:35-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&hellip; </p>

<p>This is a question.  If you are truly saved, what in this
life could ever separate you from the love of Christ?  Nothing could do this,
and now God is going to list all of these things.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>shall </i>tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are
killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in
all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I
am persuaded, that neither death&hellip;  </p>

<p>Death is something that is the enemy of mankind.  We hear
people proclaim when they are very ill or when they are in some type of
accident, &ldquo;I do not want to die!&rdquo;  Why is this?  Unsaved man says this.  Why? 
It is because death is the enemy of mankind.  </p>

<p>So God tells us that not even death will separate us from Christ. 
As we know, when the true believer dies, their spirit instantly goes home to be
with Christ.  The physical body dies because of the curse of God.  It goes back
to the grave and it decays, and yet God has even given us the assurance that
physical death cannot separate us from God, as we continue to read:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.  </p>

<p>Wow!  What a comfort the true believers can take from these
verses!  No matter what we could think of, there is nothing in all of the earth
that could separate us from God.  Once we are truly saved, we are saved
forevermore.  There is no need for us to fear Judgment Day.  As true believers,
we should not.  We should be looking forward to this day.  </p>

<p>Throughout the Bible, God has been speaking about this one
day when our salvation will be completed and we will be with Christ forever. 
How wonderful this is!  As true believers, we take great comfort in God&rsquo;s
Word.  God&rsquo;s Word is a comfort to us.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 119.  This is not a study in comfort, but for
the true believers, God&rsquo;s Word is a comfort to us.  It is the absolute truth. 
God has the ability and the power to bring to completion and fruition His
promises to His people.  This is the absolute truth.  He is going to do what He
says He will do.  There is no question about this.  The true believers trust
this with all of their hearts, because God has given to them a new heart.  We
read in Psalm 119:49:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
me to hope.  </p>

<p>For the true believers, God&rsquo;s Word is our hope and,
therefore, Christ is our hope, because you cannot separate the Word of God from
 Christ.  He is the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 119:50 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">This <i>is </i>my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
quickened me.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Word of God.  For the true
believers, it has made us spiritually alive.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Psalm 119:51-52:  </p>

<p class="verse">The proud have had me greatly in derision: <i>yet </i>have I not
declined from thy law. I remembered thy judgments of old, O JEHOVAH; and have
comforted myself.  </p>

<p>The true believers take great comfort in God&rsquo;s Word.  We
rest in His Word.  The Word of God is truth and we love it because God has
given to us a brand new heart.  Because of this, we are going to love the
Bible.  </p>

<p>Read through Psalm 119, through the whole 176 verses, and ask
yourself how you relate to what you read there.  Do you love the Word of God? 
Do you delight yourself in Christ?  This is what the believer delights in.  He
delights in God&rsquo;s Word.  He delights in doing what God says.  Read through
Psalm 119 and you will see how the true believer delights in the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Turn to Romans 15:4.  He says here:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have
hope.  </p>

<p>Through the &ldquo;comfort of the scriptures,&rdquo; which is the Word
of God, we have hope.  We have hope, because we know that God&rsquo;s Word is the
absolute truth.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Romans 15:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with one
mind <i>and </i>one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
</p>

<p>We take great comfort in the Word of God, because it is the
truth.  What He says, He will do.  He has written in the Bible His promises to
His people and He will do them.  </p>

<p>God tells us in the book of Hebrews that it is &ldquo;impossible
for God to lie&rdquo;; and so when He declares that Judgment Day is a certain month,
day, and year, then this is so.  It is so.  God even tells us in the Bible that
we are not supposed to trust in our own understanding.  Do not trust your own
heart.  Do not trust your own thoughts or your own ideas.  We are sinners; do
not do this.  We only put our trust in God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible.  We do not trust
a man.  We do not trust anything but God.  We trust God, because God is true. 
The Word of God is the absolute truth.  This is why what He says, He will do.  </p>

<p>Turn over to 2 Corinthians 1:3.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;  </p>

<p>No matter what you are going through in your life, whether
it is an illness or whether or not you are in a difficult situation, no matter
what it is, He is:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;  </p>

<p>We go to God&rsquo;s Word for strength and for comfort.  We are
comforted in it.  </p>

<p>Then 2 Corinthians 1:4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation&hellip;  </p>

<p>Unsaved man does not go to God&rsquo;s Word for comfort.  When
unsaved man is going through difficulties in this life, he turns to alcohol or
to something else for comfort.  These things do not help; but the true
believers go to Christ for comfort.  </p>

<p>So we read in 2 Corinthians 1:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
are comforted of God.  </p>

<p>We are comforted by God through His Word.  We are comforted
by sitting at the feet of Christ and feeding on the Word of God.  We have great
comfort and delight in God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p>Then 2 Corinthians 1:5-6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, <i>it is </i>for your
consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, <i>it is </i>for
your consolation and salvation.  </p>

<p>So we take great comfort in God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible.  There is
great hope for us in God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Thessalonians 4, which is very familiar to us. 
Starting in verse 14, God speaks of how the true believers are going to be
resurrected to life on the Day of Judgment.  Then He says in 1 Thessalonians
4:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  </p>

<p>That great day is coming when our salvation will be
completed.  Look how close it is now.  Look at how close the salvation of the
true believes is.  It is almost completed.  We have six months from today. 
Look at how close we are!  Our salvation is going to be completed six months
from today.  We will then be with Christ forevermore, and so we take great
comfort in the fact that our salvation is soon to be completed and that we are
eternally secure in Christ.  </p>

<p>Back in Noah&rsquo;s day, although he warned the people of that
day, they did not listen.  God prepared an ark, which was a picture of Christ. 
Noah&rsquo;s family was saved on that day, which was a picture of the fact that the
true believers do not come into condemnation because they are safe and secure
in Christ.  </p>

<p>This is the wonder and the beauty that May 21<sup>st</sup>
will be for God&rsquo;s children.  Although all of this destruction is going to be
happening, the true believers are not going to be here to see it.  They are
going to be taken up right away.  </p>

<p>Throughout the Bible, He always takes His people out before
He brings destruction.  These are great examples for us.  The flood of Noah&rsquo;s
day was an example.  Sodom and Gomorrah was an example.  Lot came out and he
was a true believer.  He did not get caught up in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah. 
Before He brings destruction, God always takes His people out.  He warns them
and then He takes them out.  He takes them out, which is a picture of us being
safe and secure in Christ.  We do not come into condemnation.  </p>

<p>We know now that before the foundation of the world, God had
already paid the penalty for our sin.  We are safe, and so there are a few
verses that I would like for us to look at.  These verses tell us how safe we
are in Christ.  It is amazing that He does not tell us this just once in the
Bible.  He tells us many, many times throughout the Bible that the true
believers are safe and secure.  We have nothing to worry about.  As far as
coming into Judgment Day, we have nothing to worry about.  We are eternally
secure in Christ.  God just goes on and on and on to tell us this.  </p>

<p>Look at John 10:22-26.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon&rsquo;s porch. Then came the Jews
round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If
thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.  Jesus answered them, I told you&hellip;  </p>

<p>Jesus is telling them that He had told them.  It continues: 
</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my
Father&rsquo;s name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not
of my sheep, as I said unto you.  </p>

<p>There are people who are having trouble with May 21.  If
they do not believe this, God is telling them that they are not of His sheep.  This
is why they do not believe it.  </p>

<p>He goes on in John 10:27 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">My sheep hear my voice&hellip;  </p>

<p>For the true believers, God gives them spiritual ears to
hear.  When He saves them, they will hear.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them&hellip;  </p>

<p>God knows all of His elect.  Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and they follow me:  </p>

<p>Then He continues on to say in John 10:28-30:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish&hellip; 
</p>

<p>The true believers will never perish because God has given
them eternal life.  He has saved them and He knows each one of His people.  </p>

<p>He continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;neither shall any <i>man </i>pluck them out of my hand. My
Father, which gave <i>them </i>me, is greater than all; and no <i>man </i>is
able to <span class="underline">pluck</span> <i>them </i>out of my Father&rsquo;s hand. I and <i>my </i>Father
are one.  </p>

<p>Can you see what God shows us here and what He has given to
us?  No one is going to snatch us away from God.  This would be impossible. 
God says that He has given to us eternal life.  We shall never perish.  The
unsaved will perish.  They will perish forever.  They are going to be
destroyed.  It does not matter who they are.  They can be a child or an
adult&mdash;it makes no difference&mdash;but the true believers will never perish.  </p>

<p>Do you see how God is emphasizing this?  He knows them, they
will never perish, and no man is able to pluck them out of His hand.  This is
because when you are saved, God has you; that is it.  He cannot lose you.  This
would be impossible.  You cannot fall away.  </p>

<p>The churches coined the phrase that someone can fall away. 
If someone does, then they were never saved to begin with.  But here God tells
us that no one is going to snatch us away from God.  This is impossible,
absolutely impossible.  &ldquo;Neither death, nor life&hellip;nor principalities,&rdquo; whatever
it is in this life, it can never snatch us away from Christ because He has us. 
God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit indwells us.  He has given us a new heart.  </p>

<p>He tells us all of these things.  He just goes on and on to
tell us all of these things.  God, who is the Almighty, the One who is
all-knowing, all-wise, and all-powerful, has given us all of these assurances
to tell us that this could never happen.  Once we become a child of God, this
could never happen.  He will never lose us.  He will never forsake us.  </p>

<p>No matter what you are going through in this life, a life
that is difficult at best, no matter what trials you are in, you name it, God
will never forsake His people, because look at what is ahead.  The action is
not in this life.  It is on the other side.  It is in the new Heaven and the
new earth, a place where this world will be forgotten.  </p>

<p> Do you see how unimportant this life is?  It is so
unimportant that God tells His elect that when we get to Heaven, this world
will not even come into mind anymore.  Do you see how unimportant the riches of
this life are or anything that this world has to offer?  Whatever this world
has to offer, the Bible says that it is &ldquo;vanity of vanities; all <i>is </i>vanity.&rdquo; 
The little trials that we go through in this life compared to the new Heaven
and the new earth, they do not compare.  They will not even enter into our
minds.  This world will be completely erased from our minds.  It will all be
gone.  </p>

<p>Can you see the wonderful blessings that lie ahead for God&rsquo;s
people?  This is what we desire for our loved ones, but they cannot see this
for dust.  They cannot understand this.  They have a spiritually dead heart and
we cannot save them, but we can see from these verses that no one can pluck us
out of God&rsquo;s hands.  We are secure in Christ forever.   </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;pluck&rdquo; that we find in John 10:29 is also used in Matthew 13 where we read of the parable of the sower.  In Matthew 13:19, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it
</i>not, then cometh the wicked <i>one, </i>and <span class="underline">catcheth away</span> that which
was sown in his heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word that was translated as &ldquo;pluck.&rdquo;  No
one can snatch us out of God&rsquo;s hand.  They cannot pluck us away from God&rsquo;s
hand.  He has us.  We cannot lose our salvation.  </p>

<p>God goes on to tell us how safe we are in Christ by using
other phrases in the Bible.  For example, turn over to Luke 10.  Luke 10 goes
on to give us more information.  Let us start in verse 17.  God had sent out
the seventy with the Gospel.  Then we read in Luke 10:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through thy name.  </p>

<p>Then Christ says to them in Luke 10:18-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and
over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but
rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.  </p>

<p>When did God place the names of His people there?  He did
this from way back into eternity past.  We are known in the infinite mind of
God from way back into eternity and our names are written there.  God has
placed our names there.  </p>

<p>Do you see how safe and secure we are?  We know that God had
to create a world and bring us into this world, and so forth.  We had to be
born to our parents.  God worked out all of this in time, and He tells us these
things, but our names are even placed in Heaven.  </p>

<p>Look also at John 14:1-3.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let not your heart be troubled&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking to the true believers.  We do not have to
worry about things.  We do not have to worry.  If you are a child of God, all
is well.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
in me. In my Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions: if <i>it were </i>not <i>so, </i>I
would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
place for you, I will come again&hellip;</p>

<p>Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <i>there </i>ye may
be also.  </p>

<p>Do you see the promise of security that God has given to
us?  He says that where He is, there is where His people will also be with Him
forevermore.  These are all wonderful verses that God has given to us in His
Word.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 147:1-4.  We read there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye JEHOVAH: for <i>it is </i>good to sing praises unto
our God; for <i>it is </i>pleasant; <i>and </i>praise is comely. JEHOVAH doth
build up Jerusalem&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is building up Jerusalem with all of the true believers. 
They are the ones who build up Jerusalem.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the
broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He telleth the number of the
stars&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who are the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in this context?  They are the true
believers.  He is not speaking about the literal stars in the heavens.  He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He telleth the number of the stars&hellip;  </p>

<p>There are a certain number of people whom God is going to
save.  Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he calleth them all by <i>their </i>names.  </p>

<p>In the Bible, the true believers are sometimes known as &ldquo;stars.&rdquo; 
 Christ is also known as a &ldquo;star,&rdquo; but He is telling us here that there are a
certain number of people whom He is going to save and He calls them all by
their names.  He knows every one of His people.  </p>

<p>Turn over to Daniel 12 where the true believers are talked
about.  Daniel 12:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that be wise&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to God&rsquo;s elect.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever.  </p>

<p>So in one sense, &ldquo;the stars&rdquo; are speaking about the true
believers.  He calls us all by our names, every one of us.  We are individually
called by God and we are secure and safe in Him forevermore.  </p>

<p>Let us now look at the unsaved in the world.  The only
security in this world is Christ and His salvation.  When He has saved us, He
has given us eternal salvation and we are safe and secure in Christ; but the
unsaved of this world find their security in this life.  Their names are not
written in the Book of Life.  Their portion and their lot are in this life.  They
find their security in riches and in what they have.  Their security is in
their money, their home, their education; it is in all of these types of
things.  This is their security.  </p>

<p>I was speaking to someone once who was looking for a
potential mate.  They were telling me the qualifications of whom they were
looking for.  They wanted this person to be financially secure.  They were looking
for their security in money and in the things that this other person might have
to offer.  </p>

<p>For the true believer, this is not so; but for the unsaved,
they find their security in this life.  However, according to the Bible, we
know that anything that we see in this life is vanity.  It is vanity.  It does
not bring happiness, even though they think that it does.  This is because they
have been deceived by these things, but this is all that they are going to
get.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Psalm 49.  Psalm 49 tells us about the
unsaved.  Their lot is in this life.  God tells us what their trust is in.  We
read in Psalm 49:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches; None <i>of them </i>can by any means redeem his
brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:  </p>

<p>God goes on to tell us about the unsaved.  They trust in the
things of this life.  This is what they trust in.  This is their lot and this
is all that they are going to get.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 16 where God is speaking to the true
believers.  We read in Psalm 49:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
house is increased; For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away&hellip;  </p>

<p>I was present at the birth of my children.  When they were
born, they did not come into this life with a handful of riches.  They came
into this world with nothing.  God tells us that it is certain that the unsaved
will leave this world with nothing.  Although they amass wealth and riches in
this life, they will leave this world with nothing.  All of this is vanity, and
yet this is their trust and this is their security.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Psalm 49:17-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
not descend after him. Though while he lived he blessed his soul&hellip;  </p>

<p>God has blessed the unsaved.  He gives them a beautiful
day.  He gives them good health.  He gives them riches.  He gives them all of
the things of this life, but this is all that they are going to get.  This is
what they trust in.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and <i>men </i>will praise thee, when thou doest well to
thyself. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see
light.  </p>

<p>Where are his riches?  In the Day of Judgment on May 21<sup>st</sup>,
no matter how much unsaved man has had in this life, what good will his money
be to him in that time of judgment?  It becomes worthless in that day, does it
not?  What is he going to buy then?  What good will his mansions do him after
May 21<sup>st</sup>?  His home is going to be destroyed along with everything
else.  </p>

<p>So we read again in Psalm 49:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
see light.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Psalm 49:20:    </p>

<p class="verse">Man <i>that is </i>in honour, and understandeth not&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember that the unsaved do not understand.  It goes on to
say that man who does not understand:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;is like the beasts <i>that </i>perish.  </p>

<p>He is like an animal.  He is going to die just like an
animal.  He will cease to exist in that Day of Judgment.  </p>

<p>So, you see, what good are these things that are his
security?  They are nothing; but for the child of God, we come into the most
wonderful blessing that there is.  Is this not true?  We will be in the new Kingdom. 
We will be in the new Heaven and the new earth forever.  We will be with God
forever.  What more could we ask for?  This life is &ldquo;but for a moment,&rdquo; is it
not?  This is only &ldquo;but for a moment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Someone could be healthy and young, and yet who could say
that they could not die tonight?  Any one of us could die this night.  God is
in control.  We could be young and fit and healthy with muscles, but let a
mosquito bite you with the West Nile virus and your health will decline
instantly.  Before you know it, you are in the emergency room where the doctors
will be trying to administer all kinds of medicine to you to keep you alive. 
Yet if God has made a decision to take you, then you will be gone and you will
be dead.  God can take any one of us at any given moment.  </p>

<p>I often use the example of a friend of mine where I work. 
She had a 14-year-old son.  He was just 14 years old.  He was on a basketball
court where he was playing with his friends and shooting some hoops.  He was
just playing around when, all of a sudden, he felt sick.  Before that moment,
there was nothing wrong with him.  He was as healthy as a horse.  He was just
14 years old.  They rushed him to the hospital.  Within about six hours, this
14-year-old boy was dead.  Just like that.  He just collapsed on the basketball
court.  </p>

<p>After this when I was able to speak to his mother, I asked
her if he had been ill.  She told me that he had not been ill.  He was a smart
kid.  He had just received a scholarship to go to the University of Pennsylvania. 
His future was bright and he was making plans, and yet God had other plans for
him.  He collapsed on a basketball court and he died.  This happened a year or
two ago.  I recently spoke to his mother and she is still in shock.  She still
cannot believe this.  </p>

<p>So not one of us is guaranteed another day.  Whether the
Lord takes us at age 10 or 14 or 20 or 50, if you are a child of God, you are
safe and secure in Him; and yet not one of us is guaranteed another breath.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a couple more verses.  Let us look at Psalm
32.  The true believers do not have to worry about physical death.  To be &ldquo;absent
from the body&rdquo; is to be &ldquo;present with the Lord.&rdquo;  Whether we &ldquo;wake or sleep,&rdquo;
we are the Lord&rsquo;s; and so we do not have anything to worry about.  Let us start
reading from verse 6.  God tells us here in Psalm 32:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found&hellip;  </p>

<p>This says: &ldquo;in a time when thou mayest be found.&rdquo;  God can
be found now.  Salvation is still possible.  Anyone can be saved.  No one is
beyond the mercy of God.  God can be found now.  The door to salvation is wide
open now, but the time will come when He will no longer be found.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh
unto him.  </p>

<p>This person is saved from God&rsquo;s eternal damnation.  The &ldquo;floods
of great waters&rdquo; destroyed the world in Noah&rsquo;s day, but the true believer is
safe.  The &ldquo;floods of great waters&rdquo; will not come near him because he is safe
in Christ forevermore.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Psalm 32:7:    </p>

<p class="verse">Thou <i>art </i>my hiding place&hellip;  </p>

<p>What do we need to hide from?  If the police are trying to
get someone, they will try to hide from the police; but we need to be hidden
from the Day of Judgment.  Christ will hide us from the wrath of God, which is
coming very soon.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou <i>art </i>my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.  </p>

<p>Then God says in Psalm 32:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go: I will guide thee with mine eye.  </p>

<p>We could say that God hovers over the true believers like an
eagle.  He is there guiding the path of all of His people.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 32:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be ye not as the horse, <i>or </i>as the mule, <i>which </i>have
no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they
come near unto thee. Many sorrows <i>shall be </i>to the wicked: but he that
trusteth in JEHOVAH, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in JEHOVAH, and
rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <i>ye that are </i>upright in
heart.  </p>

<p>Do you see how safe we are?  He tells the true believers
that they are safe in Christ, but &ldquo;many sorrows <i>shall be </i>to the wicked.&rdquo; 
He is going to destroy the wicked.  For the true believers, they will not be
destroyed.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Psalm 46:1-3.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<i> Though </i>the waters
thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof. Selah.  </p>

<p>Then look at verse 7.  Psalm 46:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH of hosts <i>is </i>with us; the God of Jacob <i>is </i>our
refuge. Selah.  </p>

<p>God is our refuge.  He uses all of these words in all of
these verses to tell us how safe we are in Him.  </p>

<p>Look at Proverbs 1:32-33.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who are the ones who are going to hearken to the Word of
God?  It is those whom God has given &ldquo;eyes to see, and ears to hear&rdquo; and a &ldquo;new
heart.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil.  </p>

<p>God indwells us when we become saved and we indwell Him.  We
are safe from the &ldquo;fear of evil,&rdquo; which is Judgment Day.  We are safe from
this.  We will not be harmed by this day.  We will not be touched, because we
are safe in Christ forevermore.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Proverbs 11:14.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Where no counsel <i>is</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that this &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; is the Word of God, and so this
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Where no counsel <i>is, </i>the people fall: but in the
multitude of counsellors <i>there is </i>safety.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;multitude of counsellors&rdquo; is pointing to God&rsquo;s Word. 
There is safety in God&rsquo;s Word, because God&rsquo;s Word is true and because God is
faithful to His promises and to the commitments that He has made in the Bible. 
</p>

<p>How wonderful it is for the true believers!  There are many,
many, many other verses.  God just keeps going on and on and on about how safe
and secure we are in Christ.  </p>

<p>For the true believers, life can be difficult at best with
one trial after another.  Maybe we are the only saved individual in our
household and it is difficult to live in this situation, but we go to God
because God knows our situation.  He knows it.  It is difficult for a spouse to
live with someone who is not saved.  This is difficult, but God&rsquo;s grace &ldquo;is
sufficient.&rdquo;  God&rsquo;s grace is sufficient for whatever situation there is in this
life.  Just think of this.  We only have to put up with these things &ldquo;but for a
moment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Turn to Ephesians 2.  God tells us here in Ephesians 2:6:</p>

<p class="verse">And hath raised <i>us </i>up together, and made <i>us </i>sit
together in heavenly <i>places </i>in Christ Jesus:  </p>

<p>When we are saved, we are reigning with Christ.  Even though
we cannot see this now, this says that we are seated with Him in the
heavenlies.  God&rsquo;s blessings just go on and on for the true believer.  We are
seated with Him &ldquo;in heavenly <i>places</i>&rdquo; in Christ.  </p>

<p>Very soon, just six months from today, God&rsquo;s promises to His
people will have been completed.  All of the problems and the tribulations of
this world will have been forgotten.  They will be forgotten forevermore.  </p>

<p>There are so many verses where God has given us this
assurance to tell us that once we are saved, we are His.  We are His.  Just
wait.  Six months from now, we will be with Christ and we will be with Him
forevermore.  This world will be forgotten and nothing of this world will come
into our minds.  This will all be completely forgotten.  It is worth it to do
things God&rsquo;s way.  </p>

<p>If anyone is not truly saved, if you do not know that you
are saved, the door is still open.  You can still cry out to God for mercy.  He
is &ldquo;the God of all comfort.&rdquo;  He is &ldquo;the Father of mercies.&rdquo;  He is &ldquo;full of
compassion.&rdquo;  He is all of these things.  He is patient.  He is kind.  God
tells us in many verses about Himself, about who He is.  When Christ walked the
earth and healed people, He did not even turn away one individual.  He would
heal them.  God tells us these things because He wants us to come to Him.  He
wants us to pray to Him.  He wants us to come before Him and to plead to Him for
mercy.  He tells us these things so that we will know that He is gracious and
that He is merciful.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
