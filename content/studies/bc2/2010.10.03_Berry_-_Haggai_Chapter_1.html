<p>Please turn to the book of Haggai.  I will read Chapter 1. 
It says in Haggai 1:1-15:    </p>

<p class="verse">In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
the first day of the month, came the word of JEHOVAH by Haggai the prophet unto
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high priest, saying, Thus speaketh JEHOVAH of hosts, saying, This
people say, The time is not come, the time that JEHOVAH&rsquo;S house should be
built. Then came the word of JEHOVAH by Haggai the prophet, saying,<i> Is it </i>time
for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house <i>lie </i>waste?
Now therefore thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; Consider your ways. Ye have sown
much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are
not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that
earneth wages earneth wages <i>to put it </i>into a bag with holes. Thus saith
JEHOVAH of hosts; Consider your ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood,
and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,
saith JEHOVAH. Ye looked for much, and, lo, <i>it came </i>to little; and when
ye brought <i>it </i>home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith JEHOVAH of hosts.
Because of mine house that <i>is </i>waste, and ye run every man unto his own
house. Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is
stayed <i>from </i>her fruit. And I called for a drought upon the land, and
upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil,
and upon <i>that </i>which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon
cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. Then Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the
remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of JEHOVAH their God, and the words of
Haggai the prophet, as JEHOVAH their God had sent him, and the people did fear
before JEHOVAH. Then spake Haggai JEHOVAH&rsquo;S messenger in JEHOVAH&rsquo;S message unto
the people, saying, I <i>am </i>with you, saith JEHOVAH. And JEHOVAH stirred up
the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the
spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all
the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of JEHOVAH
of hosts, their God, In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
second year of Darius the king.  </p>

<p>Notice that it says in Haggai 1:1 that the Word comes to
Haggai &ldquo;in the sixth month, in the first day of the month.&rdquo;  Then in Haggai 1:15, the very last verse of Haggai 1, it says that it was &ldquo;the four and twentieth day of
the sixth month&rdquo; when Jehovah stirred up Zerubbabel and Joshua, and the people
began to work.  The entire book of Haggai is actually a little picture of the
tribulation period, but we are only going to look at Chapter 1 today.  </p>

<p>So at the end of twenty-three days, they began to work
again, which is a picture of the first part of the Great Tribulation period.  We
know that at the end of the first part of the Great Tribulation period, the end
of those 2300 days that began on Pentecost in 1994, is when the Lord poured out
His Holy Spirit again, God&rsquo;s people began to work again, and God began to save
again.  </p>

<p>Let us talk about this a little bit.  In Haggai 1, this is
actually after the official tribulation period had ended.  This takes place in
the second year of Darius the king, which is actually 520 B.C.  We know that
this official tribulation period began in 609 B.C. at the death of Josiah, who
was the last good king of Judah.  This period lasted for seventy years.  Twenty-three
years (inclusive) later, in 587 B.C., the temple was destroyed.  Finally, in
539 B.C., seventy years later after 609 B.C., some of the Israelites went back
to rebuild the temple.  The Lord brought back their captivity and they went
back into their own land.  </p>

<p>We can read about this in Daniel 9.  This seventy-year
tribulation period had been prophesied by Jeremiah.  He had told the Israelites
that they would &ldquo;serve the king of Babylon seventy years.&rdquo;  This prefigured the
tribulation period that we are coming to the end of right now, which began in
1988 and which will end on May 21, 2011.  So in Daniel 9:1-2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; In the first
year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof
the word of JEHOVAH came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish
seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>How did Daniel understand &ldquo;by books&rdquo;?  He understood by studying
the Bible, as God opened his eyes to what was happening.  So this tribulation
period began in 609 B.C. and ended in 539 B.C.  This is that seventy-year
tribulation period.  </p>

<p>Back in Haggai, this is after this tribulation period has
ended; yet we still see tribulation here.  A lot of the Israelites are still in
foreign lands and the temple is in ruins.  In 539 B.C., a contingent of the
Jews went back and began to rebuild the temple; but their work was stopped by
the people of the land, which we will look at in a moment.  So we read in
Haggai 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the second year of Darius the king&hellip;came the word of JEHOVAH
by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest&hellip;  </p>

<p>Both of these men are figures of Christ.  Zerubbabel was the
governor of Judah.  Joshua was the high priest.  The Word of Jehovah is coming
to them through Haggai the prophet.  </p>

<p>All four of these names have to do with salvation or being
brought out of Babylon, as it were.  Zerubbabel means &ldquo;to descend from&rdquo; or &ldquo;to
flow from&rdquo; or &ldquo;to come out,&rdquo; to come from Babylon.  Zerubbabel is the son of
Shealtiel and Shealtiel means &ldquo;asked God&rdquo; or &ldquo;petitioned God&rdquo; or &ldquo;obtained
leave of God.&rdquo;  Joshua is the same word as &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; in the New Testament.  It
means &ldquo;Jehovah freed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah delivered&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah saved.&rdquo;  Joshua is the
son of Josedech and Josedech means &ldquo;Jehovah righted&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah justified&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah
cleansed&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah turned to righteousness.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So all four of these names have to do with salvation, and
being brought out of Babylon is a picture of salvation.  This is the sense of
this in the first place.  The Israelites are being brought out of tribulation. 
They are being brought out of Babylon and coming back into their own land. 
However, we read in Haggai 1:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus speaketh JEHOVAH of hosts, saying, This people say, The
time is not come, the time that JEHOVAH&rsquo;S house should be built.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Ezra 1, we will see what is happening here
and what this is all about.  In the opening verse of Ezra, we read in Ezra
1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia&hellip;  </p>

<p>This would be 539 B.C. when the Medes and the Persians came
in and defeated Babylon.  This is officially the end of the tribulation period
and the captivity of the Israelites.  </p>

<p>So we read in Ezra 1:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
JEHOVAH by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, JEHOVAH stirred up the
spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
kingdom, and <i>put it </i>also in writing, saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of
Persia, JEHOVAH God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and
he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which <i>is </i>in
Judah. Who <i>is there </i>among you of all his people? his God be with him,
and let him go up to Jerusalem, which <i>is </i>in Judah, and build the house of
JEHOVAH God of Israel, (he <i>is </i>the God,) which <i>is </i>in Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>God is commanding that they go back and begin to build this
temple again.  </p>

<p>Then if we go to Ezra 3:8, we read that they got started on
this.  It took them a little while, but they got started on rebuilding.  In
Ezra 3:8, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at
Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and
Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and
the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem;
and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the
work of the house of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>In other words, they began to build.  This would be 537 B.C.
at this point.  This was the &ldquo;second year of their coming&hellip;in the second month,&rdquo;
and so they began to build again in 537 B.C.  </p>

<p>If we look now at Ezra 4, we read that the people of the
land hindered their building.  We read in Ezra 4:1-2:   </p>

<p class="verse">Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto JEHOVAH God of Israel; Then
they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them,
Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye <i>do; </i>and we do
sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us
up hither.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the king of Assyria who had placed
these foreigners in the land of Judah when they went into captivity.  </p>

<p>So Ezra 4:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an
house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto JEHOVAH God of
Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.  </p>

<p>Then Ezra 4:4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah,
and troubled them in building,  </p>

<p>They actually were able to get this work stopped, but look
at what it is saying in Ezra 4:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah&hellip; 
</p>

<p>We are talking about the Promised Land in Israel.  The
people of the land are weakening the Jews in building this temple again.  </p>

<p>What we are to see in this is that this land, which is a
representation of the Kingdom of God, now has foreigners in it, people who are
not true Jews, which is a picture of the tares in the church.  So these people
were actually hindering the building of this temple.  </p>

<p>All through time, God is building a house.  He is building
the house of the true believers, and God&rsquo;s people are actually spoken of as
builders.  We read about this in 1 Corinthians 3.  It says in 1 Corinthians
3:9-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God&rsquo;s husbandry, <i>ye
are </i>God&rsquo;s building. According to the grace of God which is given unto me,
as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth
thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any
man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
stubble; Every man&rsquo;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man&rsquo;s work
of what sort it is.  </p>

<p>So God&rsquo;s people are being used to build this house.  </p>

<p>Look at Hebrews 3.  In Hebrews 3, it is speaking of Moses
and comparing him to Christ.  In Hebrews 3:3, this is speaking of Christ.  It
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this <i>man </i>was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.  </p>

<p>Moses actually represented the church here as he brought the
Law; but this is saying that Christ Jesus had much more honor than Moses.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 3:4-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For every house is builded by some <i>man; </i>but he that built
all things <i>is </i>God. And Moses verily <i>was </i>faithful in all his
house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken
after; But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.  </p>

<p>Again, the house that is being built is the true believers. 
All through time, God has been building this house, which He uses His people to
do.  We are now at the end of the tribulation period and God&rsquo;s people have
again returned.  They are attempting to start building this house again.  </p>

<p>In 1 Kings, we read about Solomon building that temple, and
it is the same picture.  Solomon is a picture of the church and he was used to
build that temple of God.  When they built the tabernacle in the wilderness,
that was also this same picture.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 127.  It starts out in Psalm 127:1 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Except JEHOVAH build the house, they labour in vain that build
it&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the house that is being spoken of.  God&rsquo;s people
have returned now to the Promised Land to build this house and they are now
being hindered by the people of the land.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 37.  We know from Genesis 17 and others
chapters that Abraham was given the physical land of Canaan, but Canaan was
simply a picture of the Kingdom of God and it always has been.  But in Psalm
37:3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Trust in JEHOVAH, and do good; <i>so </i>shalt thou dwell in the
land, and verily thou shalt be fed.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 37:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wait on JEHOVAH, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to salvation.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>So the people of the land have now hindered the Israelites
in trying to build this temple again, and this is what it is talking about in
Haggai 1:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus speaketh JEHOVAH of hosts, saying, This people say, The
time is not come, the time that the JEHOVAH&rsquo;S house should be built.  </p>

<p>It is as if they are saying, &ldquo;Now is not the time.  There is
so much opposition that we cannot do it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we read in Haggai 1:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came the word of JEHOVAH by Haggai the prophet, saying,<i> Is
it </i>time for you, O ye, to dwell in your <span class="underline">ceiled</span> houses, and this
house <i>lie </i>waste?  </p>

<p>Throughout the book of Haggai, we can see where God is
speaking both to the unsaved in the church and to His elect.  The Israelites
were dwelling in their own ceiled houses, but the house of God was still in
ruins and was laid waste.  </p>

<p>Again, this is a picture.  In the corporate church, they
have some beautiful edifices.  They are in their houses, but God is not there. 
</p>

<p>To get an idea of this word &ldquo;ceiled&rdquo; and what it is speaking
of, look at Jeremiah 22.  God is speaking to the Israelites in their rebellion,
in their apostasy, in their falling away, in their turning to Baal, and in
their false teachings, to the priests and to the prophets who were leading the
people astray.  Jeremiah 22:13-14 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
chambers by wrong; <i>that </i>useth his neighbour&rsquo;s service without wages, and
giveth him not for his work; That saith, I will build me a wide house and large
chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and <i>it is </i><span class="underline">ceiled</span> with
cedar, and painted with vermilion.  </p>

<p>This is that same word.  This is actually looking at the
corporate churches who build these beautiful churches today but they have built
them &ldquo;by unrighteousness,&rdquo; even though they are &ldquo;ceiled with cedar, and painted
with vermilion.&rdquo;  In other words, they are beautiful.  </p>

<p>This is what is being talked about in Haggai 1:4, where God
says to the Israelites:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Is it </i>time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses,
and this house <i>lie </i><span class="underline">waste</span>?  </p>

<p>Their houses are desolate.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Jeremiah 33 and we will get an idea of this
word &ldquo;waste&rdquo; and what it is talking about.  Almost the entire book of Jeremiah
speaks about the judgment that God is bringing on the Israelites through the
Babylonians.  He actually does not tell them until about Chapter 19 that He is
going to bring judgment by the Babylonians.  We see the longsuffering of God in
this.  For the first 19 chapters of Jeremiah, He just tells them of their
apostasy and their falling away, how they have turned to Baal.  Then He tells
them that He is going to destroy them.  He does not actually tell them that it
is going to be through the king of Babylon until Chapter 20.  But look at
Jeremiah 33:10, where the Lord is speaking about His house that is laid waste: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH; Again there shall be heard in this place,
which ye say <i>shall be </i><span class="underline">desolate</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking about the desolations that are going to be
brought on Israel.  This word &ldquo;desolate&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;waste&rdquo; in Haggai 1.  </p>

<p>So we read in Jeremiah 33:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH; Again there shall be heard in this place,
which ye say <i>shall be </i>desolate without man and without beast, <i>even </i>in
the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate,
without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, The voice of joy, and
the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,
the voice of them that shall say, Praise JEHOVAH of hosts: for JEHOVAH <i>is </i>good;
for his mercy <i>endureth </i>for ever: <i>and </i>of them that shall bring the
sacrifice of praise into the house of JEHOVAH. For I will cause to return the
captivity of the land, as at the first, saith JEHOVAH. Thus saith JEHOVAH of
hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast&hellip;  </p>

<p>He says this three times.  He links &ldquo;desolate&rdquo; to being &ldquo;without
man and without beast.&rdquo;  He is sending the Israelites into captivity and the
land is going to be desolate, but He is going to bring His people back.  &ldquo;The
voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride&rdquo; will again to be there, as
there will be the voice of truth going out.  Certainly, Christ is the
Bridegroom and the Church is the Bride.  </p>

<p>But this is what we are looking at in Haggai 1:4, where He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Is it </i>time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses,
and this house <i>lie </i>waste?  </p>

<p>Then Haggai 1:5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now therefore thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; <span class="underline">Consider your ways</span>. 
</p>

<p>This literally means: &ldquo;set your heart on your ways.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Haggai 1:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not
enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is
none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages <i>to put it </i>into a bag
with holes.  </p>

<p>This is tribulation language.  This is speaking of the
judgment that God has brought on the Israelites.  There is no fruit coming from
His land.  </p>

<p>Turn back to Deuteronomy 28.  Most of us are familiar with
Deuteronomy 28.  After verse 15, it goes on for over fifty verses using
terrible and frightening language where God is speaking of judgment; and God is
admonishing them in Haggai.  He is telling them what is going to happen if they
depart from His ways and His Word.  So we read in Deuteronomy 28:36-37:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over
thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there
shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. And thou shalt become an
astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither JEHOVAH shall
lead thee.  </p>

<p>This next verse is just like what we are reading in Haggai. 
We read in Deuteronomy 28:38:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather <i>but
</i>little in; for the locust shall consume it.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of judgment and tribulation.  Then we read
in Deuteronomy 28:39-42:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress <i>them, </i>but shalt
neither drink <i>of </i>the wine, nor gather <i>the grapes; </i>for the worms
shall eat them. Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou
shalt not anoint <i>thyself </i>with the oil; for thine olive shall cast <i>his
fruit.</i> Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them;
for they shall go into captivity. All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the
locust consume.  </p>

<p>This is what He is telling them is going on in Haggai 1:6. 
Then He says in Haggai 1:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; Consider your ways. Go up to the
mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it,
and I will be glorified, saith JEHOVAH.</p>

<p>Matthew Henry&rsquo;s commentary says that &ldquo;Go up to the mountain,
and bring wood&rdquo; is talking about going up to the mountains to cut the trees and
then bringing the wood back to build the house, but I do not believe that this
is what He is saying.  I think that what He is saying here is what we read in
Isaiah 2.  This house was to actually be at the top of the mountain and the
Israelites were to bring the wood up the mountain to build the house.  Isaiah
2:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
And it shall come to pass in the last days, <i>that </i>the mountain of JEHOVAH&rsquo;S
house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted
above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.  </p>

<p>I think that this is the sense of the building of the house
in terms of the mountain.  God has set His city on a hill.  He says in Matthew
5:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 48:1, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Great <i>is </i>JEHOVAH, and greatly to be praised in the city
of our God, <i>in </i>the mountain of his holiness.  </p>

<p>So Haggai was telling the Israelites to bring wood and to go
up the mountain to build the house.  </p>

<p>What is the wood?  Who is the wood?  We are the wood if we
are part of this house.  We know that when Solomon began to build that temple,
he got fur trees and cedar trees and almond trees from Hiram king of Tyre; and
these are all figures of people.  The different woods in the Bible have
different spiritual significance, but it all has to do with people being
brought in to become part of the house.  We just read about this in 1 Corinthians
3, &ldquo;If any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
hay, stubble,&rdquo; and such.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 96:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Say among the heathen <i>that </i>JEHOVAH reigneth: the world
also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people
righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that <i>is </i>therein:
then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice  </p>

<p>We read in Isaiah that &ldquo;all the trees of the field shall
clap <i>their </i>hands,&rdquo; or we read in Psalm 1 that the godly man will be &ldquo;like
a tree planted by the rivers of water.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is the wood that Haggai is speaking of to the
Israelites, as we read in Haggai 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and
I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>All of us are involved in this as we are involved in
organizing these tract trips or going on these tract trips, as we have vans and
cars with signs on them, as we give of our material wherewithal to what we
consider to be a faithful ministry or a to what we consider to be a faithful
way in which to get the Gospel out.  Many of us do a lot of praying, and this
is part of it.  We are all being used of God, if you are a child of God, to
bring wood and to build the mountain.  We are going out and we are being used
to bring in &ldquo;the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what we are reading about here in Haggai 1:8:</p>

<p class="verse">Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and
I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This is the bottom line, is it not?  It is all to the glory
of God.  He says, &ldquo;I will take pleasure in it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 149:4.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For JEHOVAH taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the
meek with salvation.  </p>

<p>He takes pleasure in His people.  </p>

<p>So back in Haggai 1:8-9, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and
I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith JEHOVAH. Ye looked
for much, and, lo, <i>it came </i>to little&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking of how He has judged His people.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and when ye brought <i>it </i>home, I did blow upon it. Why?
saith JEHOVAH of hosts. Because of mine house that <i>is </i>waste, and ye run
every man unto his own house.  </p>

<p>He is repeating the principle of every man running to his
own house while the house of God, the true house, is lying waste.  When He
says, &ldquo;I did blow upon it,&rdquo; this has to do with the judgment of God.  We will not
develop this, but this is just language of how God has judged His people and
His church.  </p>

<p>He goes on in Haggai 1:10 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth
is stayed <i>from </i>her fruit.  </p>

<p>Dew is a blessing.  It helps the herbs and the flowers and
the grass to grow, but the heaven is stayed from the dew.  God uses &ldquo;dew&rdquo; in
the Bible the same way in which He uses &ldquo;water.&rdquo;  It is a figure of the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Haggai 1:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine&hellip;   </p>

<p>Again, these are all figures of the Gospel.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and upon the oil, and upon <i>that </i>which the ground
bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
hands.  </p>

<p>We now read in Haggai 1:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice
of JEHOVAH their God&hellip;  </p>

<p>When God speaks of the &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; in the Bible, He is often
speaking of the true believers.  </p>

<p>Look at Jeremiah 23:1-3.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
pasture! saith JEHOVAH. Therefore thus saith JEHOVAH God of Israel against the
pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away,
and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your
doings, saith JEHOVAH. And I will gather the remnant&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;I will gather the remnant.&rdquo;  This is referring to the
elect.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them,
and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and
increase.  </p>

<p>Back in Haggai 1:12, we read about the remnant of the
people.  In the middle of this verse, it says that they:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;obeyed the voice of JEHOVAH their God, and the words of Haggai
the prophet, as JEHOVAH their God had sent him, and the people did fear before
JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Haggai 1:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then spake Haggai JEHOVAH&rsquo;S messenger in JEHOVAH&rsquo;S message unto
the people, saying, I <i>am </i>with you, saith JEHOVAH. And JEHOVAH stirred up
the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the
spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all
the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of JEHOVAH
of hosts, their God,</p>

<p>It said back in Haggai 1:12 that the remnant:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;obeyed the voice of JEHOVAH their God, and the words of Haggai
the prophet, as JEHOVAH their God had sent him&hellip;  </p>

<p>We read about the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesying
as this building was going on.  They were encouraging them.  </p>

<p>In the last verse of Ezra 4, we read about what has been
happening in Haggai and that the work began again in the second year of
Darius.  Ezra 4:24 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then ceased the work of the house of God which <i>is </i>at Jerusalem&hellip; 
</p>

<p>This is when the people hindered them, but then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king
of Persia.  </p>

<p>This is what we are reading about here in Haggai.  </p>

<p>Then Ezra 5:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of
Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that <i>were </i>in Judah and Jerusalem in the
name of the God of Israel, <i>even </i>unto them.  </p>

<p>Now look at Ezra 6:14.  This is as the Jews are building
again, and it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they
builded, and finished <i>it, </i>according to the commandment of the God of Israel,
and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
</p>

<p>Again, this applies all throughout time to all of people of
God who are building this temple, as it were, those who are doing the work of
God.  God encourages us and strengthens us with His Word.  This is what these
prophets are a picture of here.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 56.  Psalm 56:1-4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine enemies would daily swallow <i>me </i>up:
for <i>they be </i>many that fight against me, O thou most High. What time I am
afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put
my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.  </p>

<p>This is why many of us want to be in this fellowship every
Sunday morning, not that we have to be here, not that we are meriting anything
by showing up every Sunday morning.  It is just that we are encouraged by the
Word.  We have weaknesses and our flesh is fighting us, but we are encouraged
as we stay in the Word.  Again, this is what Haggai and Zechariah are doing
here as the people of the Lord are building this temple and doing this work. 
All through the Psalms, there are passages like this.  </p>

<p>Back to Haggai 1:13 again, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then spake Haggai JEHOVAH&rsquo;S messenger in JEHOVAH&rsquo;S message unto
the people, saying, <span class="underline">I <i>am </i>with you</span>, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>The definition of the name &ldquo;Emmanuel&rdquo; is &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Haggai 1:14-15:    </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the
high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and
did work in the house of JEHOVAH of hosts, their God, In the four and twentieth
day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</p>

<p>Remember that Haggai began to speak to them &ldquo;in the first
day of the month&rdquo; and they began to work &ldquo;in the four and twentieth day&rdquo; of the
month.  </p>

<p>We are outside now of the formal and official tribulation
period, but this is still a picture of the tribulation period because, again,
this temple is still in ruins and a lot of the Israelites are still in
captivity.  Notice how God references the time in Haggai 1:1.  It is not
according to a Hebrew king.  It is in the &ldquo;second year of Darius the king.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are still looking at the tribulation here, but it is twenty-three
days after the Lord comes to them and admonishes them because they were saying,
&ldquo;The time is not come, the time that the LORD&rsquo;S house should be built.&rdquo; 
Twenty-three days later, they began to work.  Again, this is a picture of the
latter rain period when God&rsquo;s people, with God&rsquo;s blessing, begin again to do
His work.  </p>

<p>There is another time period in Haggai 2.  Maybe if I am
absolutely convicted of what this is saying, I will speak about this next time;
because in Haggai 2:1, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the seventh <i>month, </i>in the one and twentieth <i>day </i>of
the month, came the word of JEHOVAH by the prophet Haggai, saying,  </p>

<p>This period ends at the &ldquo;four and twentieth day of the ninth
<i>month</i>.&rdquo;  Going by 30-day months, we would think that this was 63 days;
but I have been told by a couple of men who are excellent with timelines in the
Bible that this was actually a 61-day period.  </p>

<p>The language of Haggai 2 corresponds with this time period
that we are in now when God&rsquo;s people are working while the church is utterly
dead.  Satan is there.  God continues to rebuke them in this chapter and then
He ends Haggai 2 speaking of the judgment, which we are going to see on May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
However, I am not utterly convicted of this yet.  </p>

<p>A lunar cycle is 29.5 days and I need to go over again how
the priest determined when the first day of the month started.  But I have been
told that this time period in Haggai 2 is referring to 61 days.  So we would have
23 days or 2300 days of Haggai 1 and then 61 days or 6100 days of Haggai 2,
which would add up to 84 or 8400 days of the Great Tribulation period.  </p>

<p>This is all to the glory of God.  This all speaks of God&rsquo;s
salvation and the utter sovereignty that God has in salvation and how He is
going to save a remnant.  He is going to bring His people out of Babylon.  They
have gone through this tribulation and it is God&rsquo;s people who are doing the
work of the Lord.  They are the ones who are truly being used to build this
house, to go out and to bring people in.  </p>

<p>Again, to God be the glory!  This is all about the mercy of
God and this is all about His longsuffering.  If we read through Jeremiah, the
longsuffering of God is incredible.  As we read in Jeremiah, for years He told
them and admonished them over and over again, &ldquo;Turn from your ways.  I am going
to bring judgment.&rdquo;  Finally, He did.  </p>

<p>In God&rsquo;s mercy, it still is the day of salvation.  We still
have a little over seven months left, but this time does not mean anything. 
God can save in an instant whenever He wants.  We know this by looking at the
thief on the cross.  However, there is nothing we can do.  There is nothing we
can do, but we are still commanded to seek God for His salvation.  </p>

<p>Man instinctively knows that this judgment is coming.  Man
instinctively knows what is right and wrong.  He instinctively knows that there
is a God and that He is a merciful God.  All we can do, if we are not sure
whether or not we have eternal life, is just to continue to cry out to Him.  There
is nowhere else we can go.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here and pray.  </p>
