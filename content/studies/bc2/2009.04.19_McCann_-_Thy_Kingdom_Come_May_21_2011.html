<p>If everyone could turn to Matthew 6, I am going to read just
a short passage from this chapter beginning in verse 5.  It says in Matthew
6:5-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <i>are:
</i>for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the
streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast
shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain
repetitions, as the heathen <i>do: </i>for they think that they shall be heard
for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father
knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner
therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is </i>in heaven. Give us
this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people, the true believers, have learned from the
Bible that May 21 in 2011 will be the time of the rapture and that will be
followed by five months of torment on earth for all those who are unsaved and
left in the world.  Then on October 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011 will be the end of
the world.  The world, the universe, and all of the unsaved will be utterly
destroyed on that day by a fervent heat, by fire.  God will just consume this
whole creation in a moment.  </p>

<p>He can do this, just like He spoke and it came into being. 
It did not take Him very much effort to create the world and universe, and it
will not take Him much effort&mdash;He will not break a sweat&mdash;when He speaks to
destroy it, because God is all-powerful.  Of course, He has said that He was
going to do it.  He has even gone into detail in describing this in 2 Peter 3. 
And we know that when God tells us something in the Bible, it is going to
happen.  </p>

<p>Now, we have known about the timing of Christ&rsquo;s return, the
gathering of His elect, the end of the world, for a little while now, and we
have been sharing it with people.  It is very interesting how there are
different reactions to this information.  You have some people, and they are
mostly those who have no relationship (or hardly any) to the church.  They
receive the information and they are curious about it.  </p>

<p>We know that God is saving a great multitude out there in
the world.  He is drawing them.  Many will continue to listen to His Word, the
Gospel, as it goes out and gives this kind of information, just like the
Ninevites.  They were not the people of God when Jonah came to them.  They were
a foreign nation; they were not of Israel.  </p>

<p>But God sent Jonah and based on that short, little
statement, &ldquo;Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overturned,&rdquo; based on that, God
blessed His Word and multiplied it within that city so that a great many sat in
sackcloth and ashes and repented, truly and in a real way, because Jesus
confirms this, &ldquo;They repented at the preaching of Jonah and they will rise in
the judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So they were born again and God saved them on the least
information possible.  They did not have the luxury that we have of the whole
Bible and studies like &ldquo;We Are Almost There!&rdquo; that go in-depth into the
Scriptures.  We can check it all out to see if it is so, like the Bereans. 
They only had a statement from a prophet who came from a foreign nation.  How
could they believe him?  </p>

<p>Well, they believed him because God is in complete control
of who hears and who does not.  His sheep hear His voice.  His people respond
to His voice.  &ldquo;You do not believe,&rdquo; Jesus tells the Jews, &ldquo;because you are not
of My people.&rdquo;  &ldquo;You are not Mine elect,&rdquo; is what He is saying, &ldquo;and that is
why you do not believe.&rdquo;  When it comes down to it, that is the reason.  </p>

<p>So there are those people who hear this information and who
respond in a positive way, in the way in which God would have them respond,
because God is working it within them to respond in that way.  </p>

<p>But then there are other people, a great many people, most
of whom&mdash;not all of them; of course, we have not seen the reaction of everybody
in the church&mdash;but they are in the churches and congregations or they are associated
with it or maybe they are just familiar with the Bible itself and some of the
statements of the Bible.  You come to them and you say, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 is the return of Christ.&rdquo;  You share with them all of the additional information that we
have, and you are not saying, &ldquo;Well, I had a dream; I had a vision; I received
a tongue that gave me this information.&rdquo;  No, you are not saying that.  You are
saying that this comes right out of the Bible, &ldquo;All of this comes right out of
the Bible; let me tell you more about it.&rdquo;  And their response is, &ldquo;Do not go
any further.  I do not want to hear it.  No man knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what so many people say?  It makes you wonder. 
They are so quick, so sharp, and so conclusive.  They cut it off right there, &ldquo;Do
not go any further with me,&rdquo; and they superficially throw a verse out like
Matthew 24:36, </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>&hellip;</p>

<p>Then you try to say, &ldquo;Yes, but let us look at that verse.  I
am not hiding from that verse.  Let us take a look.  Remember there, it says
that the Son of Man will come in a similar way to the days of Noah.&rdquo;  Then you
go back into the Old Testament into the book of Genesis and you have that
thought in mind, &ldquo;Okay, Christ likens His coming, right after He said that no
one knows the day or hour, to the time before the flood in the days of Noah.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So let us take that question.  Did anyone in the world of
Noah&rsquo;s day know the timing of the flood?  Did anyone know the day that God
would destroy the world?  Yes.  Eight people.  Noah, his wife, his three sons
and their wives all knew ahead of time precisely the year, the month, and the
day: the seventeenth day of the second month in Noah&rsquo;s 600<sup>th</sup> year.  And
there are many verses that answer the question of how we can know that
believers, God&rsquo;s elect, will know the time.</p>

<p>So are you really being honest, are you really being
faithful, are you really being true to the Bible when you say, &ldquo;I do not want
to hear any of this information from Genesis; I do not want to hear that 1
Thessalonians 5 says, &lsquo;The Lord so cometh as a thief in the night&rsquo; and &lsquo;But ye,
brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief&rsquo;? 
I do not want to hear that.  I dismiss that.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But, you see, when we read the Bible, we are reading it
superficially, casually, on the surface, if we just take a verse and we jump to
a conclusion and we use that as a basis, like a shield.  &ldquo;Alright, I have the
Bible.  I am standing on the Word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, you are not standing on the Word of God.  You are
standing on your own understanding, a private interpretation of what you have
concluded based on a couple of verses, without comparing spiritual with
spiritual and making sure that your conclusions harmonize and fit together like
the pieces of a puzzle.  </p>

<p>Even Satan himself quotes the Bible.  He quoted it to Jesus
in the wilderness, but he was quoting it and referring to it in a very wrong
way, misapplying it.  When he would quote a verse, Jesus would quote a verse
back to him and say, &ldquo;It also says&hellip;you see, if you just take that verse on the
surface, Satan, you can come up with that kind of a meaning.  But we have to
compare it with other Scripture, and this Scripture contradicts the verse that
you came up with,&rdquo; showing us that it must harmonize.  </p>

<p>So when we are talking to people, we are talking to Christians,
professing Christians for the most part, who have said, they have professed,
they have said this, that this is their desire.  Have you ever talked to
someone who said, &ldquo;I cannot wait for Christ to come; I really cannot wait; I am
so desirous for Jesus to come&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Are you?  Are you really?  Is this the desire of your heart,
that you want Christ to come?  </p>

<p>We read Matthew 6, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.  How many people have
said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in their life?  I said it when I was not even a Christian. 
I said it before I ever knew the truth.  Many, many people in the world say
this prayer.  Did you ever take note of this verse in Matthew 6, verse 10?  Let
me read verse 9 into verse 10, Matthew 6:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p>

<p>Your Holy Name.  Your Name is Holy.  May it be good and holy
and honored.  Verse 10, Matthew 6:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy kingdom come&hellip; </p>

<p>What is that saying?  It is expressing a desire, is it not? 
It is a prayer to God, &ldquo;Bring Your Kingdom.  Bring it.  Come Lord Jesus.  Come
quickly,&rdquo; which is another prayer in the book of Revelation.  Remember that? 
In Revelation 22, the last book of the Bible, in the last chapter of that book,
it is the final cry, in a sense, to God, to Christ, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;  But not only come,
&ldquo;Come quickly; come fast.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The true child of God can get along in the world.  We are
not to be pitied.  No, it is others who are to be pitied.  We have the God of
all grace and comfort and mercy and help to aid us day-by-day.  We do not pity
ourselves; we do not feel sorry for ourselves.  Yes, we are afflicted, but we
also have great joy.  We have God Himself to help us.  It is not that we just
cannot stand it here, even though it can get pretty rough at times.  But it is
our desire that Christ fulfill His Word and all of the promises of the Bible,
all the promises of God within His Word, and that He come, that He come for the
consummation of the marriage between the bride and the bridegroom and the
consummation of the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>Christ is not coming to establish a kingdom on earth.  There
will not be a thousand-year earthly reign of Christ in any way.  It is a prayer
for Christ to come to end this world.  So you are praying, &ldquo;Thy kingdom come. 
Destroy the world, O Lord.  I do feel sorry for those within it who are not
saved; however, this must be done.  This world is not going to continue
forever.  There is an end, and so may Your kingdom come.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now, we have to understand a little bit about the kingdom,
because there is a little language that God uses in the Bible that shows that
there are some different aspects to the kingdom of God.  For instance, in
Matthew 6:33:  </p>

<p class="verse">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness&hellip;  </p>

<p>And that is for every one of us.  We are to seek the kingdom
 of God, which is that we are to implore God, to beseech God for mercy, that He
might save us.  </p>

<p>The kingdom comes universal at the end, but it also comes
individually for each individual person.  When you become saved or I become
saved, at the point of salvation, the kingdom has come.  </p>

<p>This is where some people get confused because they have
misunderstood some of what Christ was saying about the kingdom when He was
speaking on an individual level to people, like when He said in Luke 17:20-21,
where Jesus is discussing these things with the Pharisees:</p>

<p class="verse">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
should come&hellip;  </p>

<p>Now, they are thinking of that earthly kingdom, along the
lines of the Son of David who would deliver them from their earthly troubles
and establish a glorious earthly kingdom, just like many theologians and
churches mistakenly believe today.  They believe that it is all about this
world, but it is not.  </p>

<p>So they are demanding of Jesus when the kingdom of God
should come:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom
 of God is within you.  </p>

<p>Some people tried to apply this to other Scriptures that
talk about the kingdom at the end of time when God&rsquo;s kingdom will be in full
bloom, we could say, and they got it wrong.  You see, Jesus is saying that it
comes not with observation, like in John 3 with the wind&mdash;no man knows where it
blows or it listeth&mdash;because it is the Spirit of God that enters into a person
and you cannot see God&rsquo;s Spirit.  </p>

<p>When we read the Bible, we cannot see the power of God&rsquo;s
Word.  We do not see anything with our eyes, but the Bible tells us that the
Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword.  It has
that power to enter into the hearts of man and to bring salvation.  </p>

<p>So here, Jesus is making a statement about the personal
nature of the kingdom of God with each individual.  It is within you.  Now, it
is not within every person because most people are unsaved.  But when God saves
a person, then in their soul, the kingdom of God has come to them.  </p>

<p>Go over to Luke 18 in the next chapter.  It says in verse
24, in the middle part of the verse, Luke 18:24-27:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom
 of God! For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. And they that heard <i>it </i>said,
Who then can be saved? And he said, The things which are impossible with men
are possible with God.  </p>

<p>You can see the connection.  To experience salvation means
that you enter into the kingdom.  We become a citizen of God&rsquo;s kingdom.  </p>

<p>Look at Colossians 1:13, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
translated <i>us </i>into the kingdom of his dear Son:  </p>

<p>Now, when does that take place?  When are we translated into
the kingdom?  </p>

<p>At the moment of salvation, we are seated in heavenly places
in Christ Jesus.  We are not only in the kingdom, but we are in Christ who is
seated at the right hand of the Father ruling and reigning over the whole kingdom
 of God.  God speaks of His people as having crowns and reigning and so forth. 
Of course, this is all under the authority of Christ and God and we know that
He is King of kings and Lord of lords.  </p>

<p>But at the moment of salvation, we enter the kingdom of God,
even though we are still here on earth and this is Satan&rsquo;s domain.  In the
world, he is the prince of the power of the air.  He is the one who is ruling
over the unsaved in the kingdom of darkness that is on this earth.  </p>

<p>Also, go to John 3:3-5.  It says there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus
saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second
time into his mother&rsquo;s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of </i>the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>So that is one aspect of the kingdom of God.  When we become
saved, we enter in right then at the moment of salvation.  </p>

<p>Another aspect is if we were to die a believer.  A child of
God who dies, our body goes to the ground but our spirit goes to be with the
Lord, as Jesus said to the thief on the cross, &ldquo;Today, thou shalt be with Me in
paradise,&rdquo; and paradise is just a synonym for the kingdom of God; it is another
way of saying it. </p>

<p>So that is a second way.  A third aspect of the kingdom of God
is found in Matthew 25:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world:  </p>

<p>This is the final separation of the sheep and the goats, which
will be on May 21 in 2011, and now the kingdom which has been prepared from
eternity past, from the foundation of the world, is all ready for all the
saints of God, all the people of God, to enter in and it is a glorious
kingdom.  It is a new heaven and a new earth.  Within that kingdom, the
wonderful glories that are there, we read about in the Bible a little bit, and
we can only get a glimpse of them.  We get a little touch of things that are to
come concerning the greatness and the beauty and the glory and the honor, as it
says in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, of the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>We also find over in Luke 13 a very descriptive passage
relating to the day when the door is shut.  The door is Christ, so this is
describing the time when salvation will be no longer.  In this world, the day
of salvation will have come to its end.  It is over and done with.  </p>

<p>What day is that?  When is the door shut?  No, it is not in
October.  May 21 in 2011 is the seventeenth day of the second month of the
Biblical calendar, and that happens to be the day in the book of Genesis when
God shut Noah and his family and all the animals securely into the ark so that
they were guaranteed safety, but it also guaranteed that everyone outside would
be destroyed.  That is what this passage in Luke 13:24 is describing:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strive to enter in at the strait gate&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is like that eye of the needle.  Nobody can make it
through the eye of a needle.  That is why it is impossible with man but
possible with God.  However, even though it is impossible, God tells us to
strive, to put forth effort, to labor to enter into the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>We do this when we read the Bible and we pray to God, &ldquo;O
Lord, have mercy on me.  Save me.  Translate me out of this awful kingdom of
darkness and into the kingdom of your dear Son.  Give me a new heart.&rdquo;  All of
this language is approaching to God and hopefully it matches what is going on
in our inner being and that our desire is sincere.  We are going to Him and we
are crying out to Him that He would save us.  </p>

<p>So we are striving to enter in at the strait gate, which is
an impossible gate for us to get into.  But if it is God&rsquo;s good pleasure, if we
are one of His people, He will work it out and we will find entrance through
the Lord Jesus Christ who is the door into that glorious kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>So it says to strive:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not
be able.</p>

<p>Well, no one is able, and that is the problem.  But many
think that they have found the solution.  Many think that they know the way,
that they know how to get into the kingdom of God, &ldquo;Here is what you have to
do.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As soon as you hear that, as soon as somebody tries to tell
you how to do it, you know right there, &ldquo;Hold it!  Hold it!  That is works;
that is works.  If I accept Christ or if I am baptized or if I partake of the
Lord&rsquo;s table, no matter if I keep the commandments of the Bible or if I think I
can keep the law, if I obey the doctrines and teachings of the church, all of
this is works and I will never get in.&rdquo;  And we really should get away from
anyone who is trying to tell us how to get in.  </p>

<p>Luke 13:25-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
the door&hellip;  </p>

<p>And that is God Himself closing the door on that date of May
21.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door,
saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know
you not whence ye are: Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in
thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell
you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you <i>yourselves </i>thrust
out.  </p>

<p>So this is describing the very vivid truth that will take
place on that day of God&rsquo;s people being lifted up in the sight of their
enemies, all those who are left behind on the earth, all of the unsaved, and
they are going to see that the kingdom has come.  The kingdom has come: that is
what is going on.  They are seeing this one here and that one over there who
they could identify as being associated with the Bible or the Gospel, maybe
someone in their family or someone down the block whom they knew, and they are
seeing them go up.  They are seeing the believers in heaven, &ldquo;Of course, that
is the kingdom of God and I, myself, am thrust out,&rdquo; as Jesus is saying, &ldquo;You,
yourself.&rdquo;  This is how I am going to view it if I am left behind.  I see
everybody go up, so there is weeping and gnashing of teeth because I realize
that the kingdom of Christ that the Bible has plainly stated would come <span class="underline">has</span>

come.  </p>

<p>There had to be a time.  There had to be an end-time
generation.  Right?  If we believe the Bible, that is what the Bible says.  The
world would not go on indefinitely.  The world must end, according to the
Bible.  </p>

<p>Well, if the Bible says that there will be an end and if the
Bible tells some of the things to look forward to or that will be an indicator
of this end, for instance in Matthew 24:3, where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what <i>shall
be </i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  </p>

<p>The coming of Christ, what will be the sign?  Well, iniquity
will abound.  There will be the abomination of desolation in the holy place. 
False christs and false prophets will arise.  He also gives us the sign of the
nation of Israel, typified by the fig tree being in leaf.  </p>

<p>Check them off.  Check them off of your list.  The sign of
His coming and the end of the world is obvious.  What is that saying?  It is as
plain as the nose on your face.  Isn&rsquo;t it obvious, if you are honest?  </p>

<p>If you look at it as the Bible directs us to look, He is
coming.  And like all prior judgments, He does not come without first revealing
that He is coming.  He told Noah that He was coming to judge the world.  He
told Lot that He was coming to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.  And we find in
Amos, &ldquo;Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto
His servants the prophets,&rdquo; and that is just true believers who declare the
Word of God.  </p>

<p>He is coming!  He <span class="underline">is</span> returning and did you not want
Him to?  How many times have you said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;Thy kingdom come&rdquo;? 
You asked for it and He is coming.  He is coming.  In the fullness of time,
according to His timetable and His plan, He is coming.  </p>

<p>But, you know what?  The similarities with the nation of Israel
are very close to the church of our day and the Old Testament people of God. 
For centuries, if you would ask a Jew, &ldquo;Do you desire for the Messiah to come? 
Do you?  Do you want the Messiah to come?,&rdquo; their response would have been, &ldquo;Oh,
it is the longing of my heart.  It is my utmost desire.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Okay, but when the wise men came from the east to Jerusalem
and they said, &ldquo;We have seen His star and we are following Him,&rdquo; they knew whom
it was referring to because Herod asked them and they spoke about Him coming
from Bethlehem.  They knew that it was the Messiah.  But it says that when the
wise men came, Herod was troubled, and he should have been because he was a
very wicked man.  But it also says, &ldquo;and all Jerusalem with him.&rdquo;  All Jerusalem;
the people of God did not rejoice.  They did not celebrate the coming of the
Messiah finally after 11,000 years of history and after nearly 2,000 years of
being identified as the Israel of God.  Instead, they were very troubled in
their mind and it was uncomfortable.  </p>

<p>Now, today, we tell people, &ldquo;Christ is coming.  The Lord has
revealed Himself through His Word only and no other way,&rdquo; and, wow!  What
trouble is brewing within the churches and the congregations as they are so
afraid of this information and this news!  They do not want Christ to come. 
They do not, for whatever reason.  They like their life.  They like their
church system.  </p>

<p>Jesus, when He came, He did upset the applecart of the
nation of Israel, did He not?  They were exposed for what they were doing with
the Word of God.  Likewise, Christ is exposing the church of our day at the
end, that they are not being faithful and that they are under His wrath, and so
there is trouble that is stirred up within them and they are very discontent
and almost hostile at times, as some people can be, at the information that the
Lord Jesus Christ is coming.  </p>

<p>What does it say in 1 Thessalonians 4, when we read about Christ
coming in the clouds and it describes the rapture and also the resurrection? 
It says in the last verse of 1 Thessalonians 4, 1 Thessalonians 4:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  </p>

<p>You know, you speak about May 21, 2011 and October 21, 2011 and does it not comfort you?  Is it not a blessing to you to hear this?  </p>

<p>God understands it differently.  He says that this should be
a comfort of mind, because whatever you are going through, if you are a true
believer, you do not have much longer.  You do not have much longer in this
world to experience whatever you are going through.  Whatever affliction,
whatever trial, whatever trouble, how ever people hate you, whatever your
situation is in this life in India or Africa or China or America, wherever you
are where you are just despised and the lowest of the low because you share the
truth of the Bible with people, here is the comfort of God.  </p>

<p>Now, if you have disobeyed God and if you have let your
heart love this world, well, that is why you are troubled.  That is why you are
troubled and that is why you cannot receive this information in a good way.  </p>

<p>It says in James to be patient unto the coming day of the
Lord.  Why patient?  Well, people are only patient when they want something.  &ldquo;I
want something,&rdquo; like children before Christmas.  A month before Christmas, &ldquo;I
cannot wait; I cannot wait for Christmas.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Okay, dear brethren, dear child of God, be patient.  The
Lord is coming.  Great news.  Wonderful news that Christ is coming.  </p>

<p>Let us just look at one last passage.  2 Timothy 4:6-8,
where we read of the Apostle Paul who is being moved to speak:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
is at hand.  </p>

<p>Remember that Paul does represent all believers.  </p>

<p class="verse">I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my </i>course, I
have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day&hellip; 
</p>

<p>And that is just eternal life, that crown that all believers
receive where we reign and become kings, spiritually speaking, in God&rsquo;s sight. 

</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and not to me only, but unto all them also that <span class="underline">love</span> his
appearing.  </p>

<p>Love.  These are words of comfort and words of excitement in
that it is something that we have to be patient for and love.  </p>

<p>Now, we do not love what it brings.  We do not love that
people in our family, our neighbors or people we know, we know that they are
not ready.  No, we are sad; there is a burden there.  </p>

<p>However, on the other hand, we desire and long for and truly
love that Christ is returning to do what He must do.  The rebellion within this
world cannot continue into eternity.  God must wipe it out and then establish
true righteousness for eternity future.  </p>

<p>There is also a difference I think with some people.  They
are troubled maybe about their spiritual state.  Are they saved?  Are they
really a child of God?  They think about the end, &ldquo;On one hand, yes, I want Christ
to come; but on the other, I am afraid.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, that is understandable.  It is understandable to be
fearful and to be afraid of this information.  But it is a completely different
thing to have a mind and a heart set, as so many do, who, yes, they desire Christ&rsquo;s
coming and yet they are completely set against Him and His Word and the
information that He is revealing at this time that He is coming.  </p>

<p>Remember in the parable of the ten virgins, there was a cry
made at midnight, &ldquo;The bridegroom cometh!  Go ye out to meet Him,&rdquo; but He did
not come right then.  There was a little space, because the foolish virgins had
an opportunity to go and look for oil.  </p>

<p>So, again, Christ gives warning ahead of time.  There is a
cry made, &ldquo;The bridegroom cometh!&rdquo;  Then a little later in that parable, He did
come and the five wise virgins entered in and the door was shut, and the
foolish were locked out.  </p>

<p>Once again, we know when it is going to happen.  If you do
not know when, it may be because you desperately do not want it to happen.  But
your desperation in desiring this will not stop it.  It cannot stop it because
this is God&rsquo;s doing.  </p>

<p>Okay.  We will stop here and let us have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p>Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for advanced notice and
forewarning, as you gave to Noah.  It says that Noah moved with fear.  Father,
may we move with fear according to how You are dealing and working with each
one of us, for the time is at hand.  The kingdom of God is at hand, and we do
pray that we might be found worthy to enter into the kingdom.  No, not based on
ourself or on anything that we ever did or are doing or could possibly do, but
based on Christ&rsquo;s work and what He has done.  We do pray that through this we
can enter into Your kingdom and serve You, as You are King of kings and Lord of
lords.  Father, we pray that You would be with us today, Your Sabbath Day. 
Help us to do Your will.  We do ask for opportunity to share Your Word with
people whom we meet.  We pray that You might be with anyone who is traveling
far, and we pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>We have some time. 
Instead of singing a hymn right now, because we made short changes at the end,
if anyone has any questions or comments that you would like to make, you are
welcome.  You can come up here to the mic.  If you are on Paltalk, you can just
raise your hand there and we will try to take your question.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:</i>  </b>I was wondering if
you could look at Matthew 7:13 and compare it to Matthew 25:34.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Okay.  Matthew 7:13-14: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide <i>is </i>the gate, and
broad <i>is </i>the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which
go in thereat: Because strait <i>is </i>the gate, and narrow <i>is </i>the way,
which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</p>

<p>You want to look at Matthew 25:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world:  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):</i>  </b>I am
sorry.  I take that back.  It is Matthew 7:13 compared with Luke 13:24.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Okay.  Yes, it is a
similar statement.  Luke 13:24 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.  </p>

<p>Except in Matthew, we are given a little bit more
information about the broad way.  So not only is there a very narrow portal
into heaven, because it is really impossible for a man to enter into heaven on
his own efforts, but on the other hand, to go to destruction, it is so wide open
that anybody can do that.  Anybody can go down the wrong path that will lead to
their ruin.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):</i>  </b>If you
go the right way, that means that you will be leading to Christ, right?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Right, and what is the
right way?  Listening to the Bible, listening to what the Scripture says, and
part of the right way is recognizing, &ldquo;I cannot do it; I cannot get myself
saved; salvation is of the Lord; it is by the faith of Christ, not by my faith.&rdquo; 
However, in the meantime while I wait on God to save me, I am not going to wait
in the bar, I am not going to wait, you know, filling myself with all the
worldly pleasures that I can.  God says, &ldquo;No, strive to enter in.&rdquo;  That is, turn
from what sins you can turn from; get away from cigarettes and drugs and
alcohol, whatever it is that is in your life.  Doing this is not going to save
you, but strive and beseech God to grant you His salvation.  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </i></b>Can you repeat the
announcement for Cinco de Mayo?</p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>May 3<sup>rd</sup>.  It
is just basically going to be whoever wants to go on May 3<sup>rd</sup>.  We
will have the normal morning meetings here.  From here, we will probably get a
quick lunch, a couple of sandwiches, and then we will drive out with everyone
following one another.  That is what we have done in the past.    </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>Where
are we going?</p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Kennett Square area.  It
is actually near Longwood Gardens, or past it.  </p>

<p><b><i>Comment:  </i></b>I have made some comment about
wanting to get a revised directory but I have been sick for the last couple of
weeks.  If anybody would have any suggestions or would like to help, they might
give me a call at home.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Okay, thank you.    </p>

<p><b><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </i></b>What does the oil
symbolize in Matthew 25?      </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>In Matthew 25 with the
ten virgins, it says in verse 3, Matthew 25:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">They that <i>were </i>foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.  </p>

<p>Oil represents in the Bible the Holy Spirit.  When a prophet
would anoint a king to be king, he would anoint him with oil because it was a
picture of the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>What does the lamp normally represent in the Bible?  Psalm
119 says, &ldquo;Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So they both have lamps because they are all Christians.  They
both have lamps.  Everybody has a Bible in the church sitting on their pulpit. 
They are all there; however, the problem is that the foolish or the unsaved do
not have oil in their vessels.  They do not have God&rsquo;s Spirit within them to
enlighten the Word of God.  </p>

<p>That is fatal when it comes to the information about the
time of the end, because the wise will understand but none of, we could say,
the foolish will understand, even though they all heard this message, &ldquo;The
bridegroom cometh.&rdquo;  The bridegroom cometh, but because they lacked oil, they
did not have the Spirit of God, so they went to them who buy and sell. 
Remember that God speaks of buying and selling as ministering the Gospel.  And
the wise told them in verse 9 [<i>note: speaker inadvertently said verse 8</i>],
because they desired oil of them and we cannot give salvation to any other
individual, Matthew 25:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so; </i>lest there be not
enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves.</p>

<p>Why did they tell them that?  Why did they tell them to go
to the church?  Because they did not tell them to go to the church.  They said,
&ldquo;Go to <span class="underline">them</span>, the Triune God.  Go to God Himself.&rdquo;  As He says in Isaiah
55, He is that merchantman who typifies the language of merchandise with the
Gospel, but He freely gives, and yet they misunderstood.  They went to the
church for their answers and they ended up being locked out when the door was
shut.  </p>

<p><b><i>4<sup>th</sup> Question:</i>  </b>Can you explain the
last day for the believers in May and the last day for the world in October?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Yes, May 21, 2011, we know because God has confirmed this through His Word, especially as we understand
the seven-thousand-year period from Genesis 7.  The last day of salvation will
be on May 21, 2011 because that is the seventeenth day of the second month of
the Biblical calendar, which is the exact day that God shut Noah into the ark. 
</p>

<p>That door, with the shutting of the door, Jesus said, &ldquo;I am
the door,&rdquo; so that is the end of salvation.  But there is still a Feast, the
Feast of Tabernacles, that has to be fulfilled because the other two main
Feasts were fulfilled.  Passover was fulfilled when Christ was on the cross. 
Pentecost was fulfilled when the Holy Spirit was poured out.  On the day of
Pentecost, it was fully come because the Feast was fulfilled in that as the
firstfruits would be brought in through the Church Age, salvation would come to
all those whom God would save.  The third Feast was Tabernacles or Ingathering,
and that Feast has not been fulfilled as the other two.  That is why we have to
go to the end of that Feast, which is October 21.  </p>

<p>So we had a problem for awhile until there was a correction
made.  In understanding the nature of that Feast, there would be an eighth
day.  We had October 20<sup>th</sup>, if you remember, for a period of time. 
When that correction was made, we saw the eighth day, &ldquo;Oh, the eighth day; the
last day of the Feast is October 21,&rdquo; and then we could see it clearly: May 21
to October 21 is five months or one hundred and fifty-three days.  Then we saw verses,
also from Genesis 7, like the flood waters prevailing for one hundred and fifty
days or five months.  And in Revelation 9, we saw the five months of torment. 
Then everything began to make sense.  </p>

<p>So when the Bible says, like in Luke 13, that the door is
shut and you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God, and those
left behind begin to weep and gnash their teeth, that is how we received
correction about hell because when we understood time, then the understanding
of judgment followed, because if they are weeping and gnashing their teeth on
May 21, that is still on the earth and they still have five months left.  Then
you think, well, that cannot be eternal damnation in a place called hell, and then
all kinds of verses fit that speak of perishing and destruction and ruin, all
of those verses.  </p>

<p>If anyone on Paltalk has anything else, Lord willing, we
will be on Paltalk tonight in the Ebiblefellowship room beginning at 8:30 P.M. ET, but we will stop here.  </p>
