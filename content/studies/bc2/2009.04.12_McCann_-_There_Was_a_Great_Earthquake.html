<p>Let us turn to Matthew 27.  I am going to start reading in
verse 57.  This is after Jesus died on the cross.  I will go into chapter 28,
the first ten verses.  It says in Matthew 27:57-28:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus&rsquo; disciple: He went to Pilate, and
begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And
when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, And laid
it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a
great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. And there was Mary
Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Now the next
day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees
came together unto Pilate, Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said,
while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore
that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by
night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead:
so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have
a watch: go your way, make <i>it </i>as sure as ye can. So they went, and made
the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch. In the end of the
sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day </i>of the week&hellip;  </p>

<p>In the King James, the English wording for Matthew 28:1 is
not correct.  Actually, it is better read from the Greek:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the end of the sabbaths, as it began to dawn toward the first
of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And,
behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from
heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His
countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: And for fear of
him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men.</i> And the angel
answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus,
which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
place where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is
risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall
ye see him: lo, I have told you. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre
with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. And as they
went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they
came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. Then said Jesus unto them,
Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall
they see me.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This is the wonderful account that the Bible records for us
of the death and then the burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and it is
the Christian&rsquo;s or the child of God&rsquo;s great hope.  As we see that Christ rose
from the dead, we also have faith that we will rise from the dead if we were to
die, or to be raptured if we remain alive.  </p>

<p>Yet before we get into this and discuss this, we have
learned a lot more over the last year, since last Easter, that we have to keep
in mind.  We have to view what we are reading here with this other information
in mind, like Revelation 13:8 which says that Jesus was as a Lamb slain from before
the foundation of the world or from the foundation of the world.  That verse,
which has always been there (except we did not understand it properly), is
telling us that Christ died for His people&rsquo;s sins before the world began.  </p>

<p>Actually, Christ created the world.  He was the Son who
spoke and the world came into being.  Before that happened, everything was
finished.  All of the works necessary to save His people were completed.  They
were done and we have to keep that in mind.  </p>

<p>Also, if we go to Romans 1, there is a little passage that
gives us more information.  We do read that Jesus was slain from before the
foundation of the world, but we do not read anywhere, very straightforwardly,
that He rose.  It does not say that He was resurrected from before the
foundation of the world.  But since He died, He had to rise or He could not
have entered into the world at the time that He did.  In Romans 1, God really
covers this idea.  In Romans 1:3-4, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh; And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead:  </p>

<p>Now, did everybody hear that?  Did you see that?  Did you
see how that was said?  God does this all the time.  He will make a statement
in the beginning part of the verse:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God with power&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then He will give more information following it that
actually makes it easy for us, who are so dull of hearing to begin with, to
miss the point.  Then at the end of the verse, He will conclude with a very
important bit of information.  </p>

<p>In other words, if it read that Jesus, who this is speaking
of:  </p>

<p class="verse">And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God with power by the
resurrection from the dead.  </p>

<p>You see, if you take out that little middle part, it is more
straight and clear.  It is telling us that Jesus was declared, that the name or
the title given to Him of the Son of God was via or through or by the
resurrection from the dead.  </p>

<p>So in order for Jesus to be called the Son&mdash;and we can see
why this would be because He rose and He was the first begotten from the dead,
as it tells us in Colossians&mdash;He rose from the dead.  At that point, He became
the first Son to do so, and so that is when He was declared to be the Son.  </p>

<p>Now, this is important because in Hebrews 1:2, it says in
reference to God:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by <i>his </i>Son, whom
he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>

<p>So Jesus was the Son before the creation.  He was the
Creator, but He was the Creator who was called the Son.  He could not be called
the Son unless He had first risen from the dead, which means that He died from
the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>So He paid the penalty in full.  The wages of sin is death. 
Whatever God&rsquo;s Law required, Christ fulfilled completely.  Then He rose; He was
resurrected.  At that point, He was called the Son.  </p>

<p>I do not know how we can pinpoint this.  This was still in
eternity past.  He had not yet created the world.  But following this, He
speaks and He creates the universe and the earth as the Son.  </p>

<p>Then later, after time begins to unfold, He enters into the
human race; actually, after 11,000 years of history.  He is born of a virgin
and He is raised in the household of Joseph and Mary.  Then later, He begins
His ministry, which includes going to the cross and dying and then being buried
and then being raised again.  After the three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth, He is raised early Sunday morning.  </p>

<p>Yet it is all to show us or to teach us what He had already
done from before the world began, and this is what we have to keep in mind. 
This is what we have to remember when we are reading Matthew 27 or Matthew 28. 
This was Jesus demonstrating what had taken place prior to the world&rsquo;s
beginning, and this helps us to know that Christ was suffering before the
cross.  He did suffer (on the cross), but He was not bearing sins at that point
in time; He had already paid for them.  </p>

<p>Well, I thought we could go through a few verses here in
Matthew 28 and also take a look later at a couple other places in the other
gospels that refer to the time from that early Sunday morning when the
disciples came to the grave and what they found.  It says in Matthew 28:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the end of the sabbaths, as it began to dawn toward the first
of the sabbaths&hellip;   </p>

<p>Why does God put this that way?  The reason is that the Old
Testament Sabbath was Saturday, the seventh day, a day when God had said that
there was to be no work done.  It was a day of rest.  If anyone did any work, they
were stoned to death, like the man who picked up a few sticks in the
wilderness.  God ordered him, commanded him, to be killed by stoning because
that Sabbath looked towards the work that Christ had done and would do as He
would enter into the world as the Messiah in order to fulfill all righteousness
and to make things manifest of what He had already accomplished.  </p>

<p>So that was the end of the Sabbaths.  Early Sunday morning,
God was finished using the seventh day as the Sabbath Day.  That cycle, which
was from creation, was finally broken.  That is why it is plural:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the end of the sabbath<span class="underline">s</span>, as it began to dawn toward
the first of the sabbath<span class="underline">s</span>&hellip;   </p>

<p>Because that Sunday morning was the first Sunday Sabbath,
the very first one.  </p>

<p>By the way, I was just thinking about this.  We know that
from the cross, which was Friday&mdash;I think it was April 1<sup>st</sup> in the
year 33 A.D.&mdash;until May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011 is 722,500 days.  Right?  That
is one of the proofs that show us that May 21<sup>st</sup> is going to be the
rapture, because that number, if you break it down, is 5 x 10 x 17 x 5 x 10 x
17.  That is the one that repeats.  It shows the number 5 for the atonement,
which Christ made on that day in 33 A.D.  It also shows the number 10, the
completeness of the work of God in applying that atonement to His people.  Then
the number 17 represents Heaven.  </p>

<p>So God is telling us that, yes, we are correct, and there
are many other bits of evidence that God gives us that May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be the rapture and the day of the resurrection.  Yet when we realize
that the first Sunday was two days later, then it was 722,498 days.  Right?  If
Friday was 722,500, two days later gives us 722,498, which divides by 7 pretty
neatly; it is 103,214 Sabbath Days until May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  That is the total number of Sundays that God gave to the world, the Sunday
Sabbath.  That last one in May will be the 103,214<sup>th</sup>.  </p>

<p>Just to put this in perspective a little bit, from this
Sunday until May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, we have about 109 Sabbaths left.  So
103,105 have passed&mdash;now, I am very close with these numbers; I am not saying that
I am exact, but I am very close&mdash;leaving about 109 more Sundays.  </p>

<p>So if you are someone who does not delight in the Lord&rsquo;s
Day, if it has been a burden to you and you cannot wait for the Sabbath to be
past in order to get to your normal activities&mdash;whatever it is that you enjoy
and want to do&mdash;then you will not have very much longer to put up with Sunday,
just about 109 more counting this one, I believe.  So be patient.  Be patient. 
It is coming to an end.  </p>

<p>Well, I am sorry; I should not say it like that.  You know,
it is sad.  It is very sad that God has given us this day and it is a beautiful
day.  It is a great day for spiritual activities.  It is a wonderful day for
reading the Bible and for worshipping God, to do all of these things on Sunday,
and yet there are very few left, very few.  </p>

<p>Well, here, in Matthew 28:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the end of the sabbaths, as it began to dawn toward the first
of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And,
behold, there was a great earthquake&hellip;  </p>

<p>You know, when we read about resurrection in the Bible,
sometimes God joins it together with an earthquake, like in the previous
chapter.  In Matthew 27:50-54, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; And the graves were
opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And came out of the
graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto
many. Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw
the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying,
Truly this was the Son of God.</p>

<p>You see, again, there was an earthquake and the graves were
opened.  In Matthew 28, there is an earthquake and the tomb of Jesus is open. 
That is how God is identifying an earthquake in the Bible.  </p>

<p>It is also found in Revelation 11.  In Revelation 11, we
read about an earthquake after the two witnesses had stood upon their feet.  I
will start at the beginning of Revelation 11:11.  It says in Revelation
11:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God
entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon
them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,
Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies
beheld them. And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part
of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and
the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.  </p>

<p>So in these verses, we see the two witnesses standing on
their feet, which has to do with the latter rain period that we are currently
in as God is sending the Gospel into the world.  Then following that&mdash;and that
is what will happen&mdash;on May 21<sup>st</sup> will be the rapture.  Notice here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they ascended up to heaven in a cloud&hellip;</p>

<p>Jesus comes at His return, as it says in 1 Thessalonians 4, in
the clouds.</p>

<p class="verse"> &hellip;and their enemies beheld them&hellip;</p>

<p>This is because it is the rapture.  They are taken up.  At
that time, all of the unsaved will see.  All of those left behind will see this
happen.  This is one of the verses that lets us know this matter-of-factly. 
They will behold these things with their eyes.  </p>

<p class="verse">And the same hour was there a great earthquake&hellip;</p>

<p>This is because this is also the day of the resurrection,
May 21<sup>st</sup>.  It is the day when Christ will speak and those who are in
the graves will hear His voice and come forth, some to life and some to the
resurrection of damnation, which means that they will be brought out of the
graves and lifted up supernaturally by the power of God.  They are not coming
back to life.  None of the wicked, none of the unsaved will experience
conscious existence again, but they will come up by God&rsquo;s power as He raises
them.  Since they are coming up, God says that they are hearing His voice even
though they have no life, and then they will be scattered on the face of the
earth as dung, according to a few places in the Bible, and that day is close at
hand.  </p>

<p>If we also go to Zechariah 14, Zechariah is the
next-to-the-last book in the Old Testament.  It says in Zechariah 14:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall flee <i>to </i>the valley of the mountains; for the
valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye
fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and
JEHOVAH my God shall come, <i>and </i>all the saints with thee.</p>

<p>Once again, we see the earthquake and Christ coming with the
saints.  That is, again, what the Bible tells us will be the case.  Jesus will
come with His people.  He will come with the saints and it is linked together. 
God associates it with the earthquake, which will be worldwide, because that is
where the bodies are; they are everywhere; they are all over the face of the
earth.  </p>

<p>So the ground will open up at the cemeteries, obviously, but
it could open up right in the middle of our house because we do not know what
has been going on for 13,000 years of history before our time.  Maybe some
ancient people have been buried in our backyard or in our front yard, or
wherever; we have no idea.  </p>

<p>So there is really nowhere to run.  There is nowhere to hide
and to escape and say, &ldquo;Well, I will just get away from tall buildings.&rdquo;  That
will not be the case.  The ground is going to open up on a massive scale
everywhere in the world, and the Bible is telling us this.  </p>

<p>In the Greek, &ldquo;great earthquake&rdquo; is <i>megas</i> <i>seismos</i>. 

<i>Seismos</i> is maybe familiar to you, like a seismograph that is used to
measure earthquakes.  They get that word from the Greek word for earthquake. 
They also use seismometers that measure the force of the shaking of the ground,
and it comes from this word that is in Matthew 28:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, there was a <span class="underline">great earthquake</span>: for the angel
of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the
door, and sat upon it.  </p>

<p>Who is &ldquo;the angel of the Lord&rdquo;?  The language of &ldquo;the angel
of the Lord&rdquo; is found many times in the Bible, and it is God.  It is the Lord
Jesus.  The Lord Jesus actually is the One who came and rolled back the stone and
sat upon it and announced His own resurrection.  Is that not amazing!  This is
actually what is in view, that Jesus was announcing His own resurrection.  </p>

<p>If we go to Exodus 3:2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel of JEHOVAH appeared unto him in a flame of fire
out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
fire, and the bush <i>was </i>not consumed.  </p>

<p>In the King James, it says &ldquo;the angel of the LORD&rdquo; and &ldquo;LORD&rdquo;
is capitalized, but this is the same person as in Matthew 28:2 [<i>note: the
speaker inadvertently referred to Matthew 28:1</i>].  It is the angel of God,
the angel of the Saviour, the angel of the Lord, who is Christ.  </p>

<p>Or go over to Judges 13.  You might remember this account of
Manoah and his wife as they were told that they would have a son, a very
special son, who was Samson.  God came to them in the form of this angel of the
Lord.  It says in Judges 13:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel of JEHOVAH said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
unto the woman let her beware.  </p>

<p>Then verse 15, Judges 13:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Manoah said unto the angel of JEHOVAH, I pray thee, let us
detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.  </p>

<p>And then verse 16, Judges 13:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel of JEHOVAH said unto Manoah&hellip;  </p>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;the angel of Jehovah&rdquo; is also in the bottom part
of verse 16.  It is in verse 17 and verse 18.  There are many references to &ldquo;the
angel of Jehovah.&rdquo;  Then in verse 20, Judges 13:20-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
off the altar, that the angel of JEHOVAH ascended in the flame of the altar.
And Manoah and his wife looked on <i>it, </i>and fell on their faces to the
ground. But the angel of JEHOVAH did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife.
Then Manoah knew that he <i>was </i>an angel of JEHOVAH. And Manoah said unto
his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</p>

<p>So, very definitely, the &ldquo;angel of the LORD&rdquo; is God.  It is Christ
Himself.  </p>

<p>There is another reference in Psalm 34:7:</p>

<p class="verse">The angel of JEHOVAH encampeth round about them that fear him,
and delivereth them.</p>

<p>Of course, God is the One who gets the fear and not an
angelic being.  We are not to fear angels who are in heaven, only God Himself. 
There are many Scripture verses that support and prove that &ldquo;the angel of the
Lord&rdquo; is God.  </p>

<p>If you think that it is kind of unusual that Christ is
announcing His own resurrection, to us it is, but He also announced His own
birth.  It was the same situation when He came into the world in Matthew 1.  In
Matthew 1:20, this is referring to Joseph and it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not
to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>In that, Jesus is referring to Himself.  He is referring to
His own birth.  </p>

<p>In Luke 2, we also read of this.  Luke 2:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of
the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said
unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord.</p>

<p>This is a mystery to us.  Why did they not recognize this &ldquo;angel
of the Lord&rdquo; as Jesus?  This happened several times where Jesus appeared after
His resurrection and they did not recognize Him.  When He was on the road to Emmaus,
those two disciples did not recognize Him until later when they broke bread and
then they knew who He was.  Also, when Jesus was on the shore while the
apostles were fishing, He asked them, &ldquo;Have you caught any fish or meat?&rdquo;  They
said, &ldquo;None.&rdquo;  Then He told them to cast the net to (I think it was) the right
side of the boat and they caught 153 fish; then they recognized that He was the
Lord.  </p>

<p>So, too, here in Matthew 28:2 [<i>note: speaker said Matthew
28:1</i>].  This is Christ:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and
rolled back the stone from the door&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what Resurrection Sunday is all about, because that
stone sealed the tomb.  They tried to make sure that it would never be moved. 
The Romans and the Jewish leaders were concerned that Christ&rsquo;s body would be
taken and that His disciples would start telling a story, so they sealed the
stone and set a watch to make sure that His body could never be taken, and yet
that could not stop God.  He simply rose from the dead and went to heaven and
no earthly stone or barrier of any kind could ever stop Christ from
accomplishing His mission of showing what He had done from before the
foundation of the world.  So He just rolled the stone away.  </p>

<p>Just like in the case of Lazarus in John 11.  Remember
Lazarus whom Jesus loved and his sisters, Martha and Mary?  Well, Lazarus experienced
a sickness and died, and it says in John 11:34-44:  </p>

<p class="verse">And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
and see. Jesus wept. Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! And some of
them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused
that even this man should not have died? Jesus therefore again groaning in
himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus
said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith
unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <i>dead </i>four
days. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away the stone <i>from
the place </i>where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <i>his </i>eyes, and
said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou
hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <i>it, </i>that
they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound
hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus
saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>

<p>Jesus was able to do this, to raise Lazarus from the dead,
because He was already victorious.  He had already conquered sin and death.  He
had already died and risen from the dead Himself before this event in John 11,
and so He could raise Lazarus, just like He can raise and will raise all of His
people who are in the ground who have died.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Matthew 28:2 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and
rolled back the stone from the door&hellip;  </p>

<p>That stone represented what?  There is the tomb and there is
this big stone covering the tomb.  It is the entrance into the grave or hell,
because that is what hell means; it means the grave.  So that stone, really, is
like the gate of hell.  </p>

<p>When someone dies unsaved, their eternal fate has been performed. 
They will never come back to life again.  Hell, the grave, has devoured that
person.  It has securely locked them into the blackness of darkness forever.  They
will never come into being.  </p>

<p>But here, Jesus is rolling away the stone, showing that He
is victorious over hell itself.  He is victorious over death.  That is why,
after rolling the stone from the door, He sat upon it.  He sat upon the stone. 
</p>

<p>Would that not be a sight?  I do not know how big that stone
was.  It was said to be a &ldquo;great stone.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They had hewn the tomb out of the rock and had cut this
opening.  So they rolled this stone away and there sat the angel of the Lord,
sitting upon the gate of death, sitting upon the door that had sealed so many
people&rsquo;s fate.  </p>

<p>To &ldquo;sit&rdquo; in the Bible means &ldquo;to rule.&rdquo;  It means &ldquo;to reign,&rdquo;
because kings would be seated upon thrones.  It means &ldquo;to judge.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Here, the Lord Jesus is ruling over death.  He has been
victorious over death itself.  Just like we read in 1 Corinthians 15:54-57,
where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  O death, where <i>is
</i>thy sting? O grave, where <i>is </i>thy victory? The sting of death <i>is </i>sin;
and the strength of sin <i>is </i>the law. But thanks <i>be </i>to God, which
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>This is what is in view.  It is a triumph.  It is a glorious
triumph over hell or the grave, over death itself, where Jesus has conquered
death.  He has beaten death and risen from the grave.  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 28:3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
snow:</p>

<p>These descriptions can be found in Daniel 7:9 [<i>note: the speaker
inadvertently referred to </i><i>Daniel</i><i> 8:9</i>], as far as the raiment,
and Daniel 10:6, as far as the face like lightning.  So this is referring to
God and it is some of the descriptive language that the Bible uses to teach us
about God.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Matthew 28:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men.</i>
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye
seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>

<p>Here we have the keepers who are shaking for fear and we
have the believers, the women who came to the tomb.  God is trying to comfort
them and He tells them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fear; don&rsquo;t you fear; you have nothing to
fear.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people have nothing to fear as far as death is
concerned.  Do we?  Actually, it is turned around.  The Bible says, &ldquo;To die is
gain.&rdquo;  Because if we die tonight, or anytime between now and the end, well, we
just got there a little quicker than everybody else, a little faster, and that
is the perspective that the Bible gives true believers on death.  It is not
something to be feared anymore because we are not going to perish and we are
not going to cease to be; we are going to live forever in the new heaven and
the new earth, and so there is great comfort in the Bible&rsquo;s language regarding
death.  </p>

<p>This should help us to be bolder; for instance, in going on
a mission trip.  The plane could crash.  Many things could happen.  But if that
is the case, has the child of God lost anything?  No, he has just gained; he
has gotten to heaven to be with the Lord a little quicker than his brethren,
than other believers who have to wait until the day of the resurrection and the
rapture.  </p>

<p>So here in Matthew 28:5-6, Christ says:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was
crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
where the Lord lay.</p>

<p>This is what I wanted to look at in a couple of other
passages, &ldquo;the place where the Lord lay.&rdquo;  We are being beckoned by the Word of
God to take a look at the tomb, the empty tomb.  </p>

<p>In Luke 24:11-12, after the women had gone to tell the
apostles that Jesus had risen, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
them not. Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he
beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself
at that which was come to pass.  </p>

<p>They had wrapped Jesus in linen and spices.  It is
interesting that the Greek word (in verse 1) for &ldquo;spices&rdquo; is <i>aroma</i>, so
we see another word that we use in our language that comes from the Greek.  </p>

<p>They had placed Him in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea, but
when they came to the grave, when they came to the sepulcher, they only found
the linen.  That is all that they found.  Here it says that the linen clothes
were laid by themselves.  </p>

<p>John 20 is another account of the resurrection, and I will
start reading in verse 4.  John 20:4-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he stooping down, <i>and looking
in, </i>saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. Then cometh Simon
Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes
lie, And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes,
but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>

<p>God is making a point of showing us the empty tomb.  One of
the points is that this is what they buried Christ in.  He had these clothes
wrapped about Him.  Then we see the tomb is empty and there are the clothes. 
This is another way of saying that death could not hold its prey, that the
burial cloth was left in the tomb where it belonged and that Christ rose from
the dead.  </p>

<p>But there is another reason also as to why God is emphasizing
these linen clothes that has to do with the work of the high priest, with the
high priest and the law that God gave concerning the Day of Atonement.  On the
Day of Atonement, the high priest would go inside the Holy of Holies and he
would offer sacrifice.  God spells out what he was to wear in Leviticus 16:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the
linen mitre shall he be attired&hellip;  </p>

<p>That would be the hat; everything was made of linen.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;these <i>are </i>holy garments; therefore shall he wash his
flesh in water, and <i>so </i>put them on.  </p>

<p>So he had to put on all of this linen that covered most of
his body and then he would offer the sacrifices of the animals that were
required on the Day of Atonement.  </p>

<p>By the way, the high priest went once a year into the Holy
of Holies, twice.  He did it twice, which reminds us that Christ suffered
before the foundation of the world and then He suffered a second time.  </p>

<p>In Leviticus 16:11, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which <i>is
</i>for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which <i>is </i>for himself:  </p>

<p>Then a little later, in verse 14, Leviticus 16:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle <i>it
</i>with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. Then shall he kill
the goat of the sin offering, that <i>is </i>for the people, and bring his
blood within the veil&hellip;  </p>

<p>Now, we have to read this closely.  He already had slain the
one animal and had gone in and sprinkled it; then he has to kill the other
animal.  Would he kill it inside the Holy of Holies?  No way.  There is no
way.  He had to go back out and slay the other animal and then come in a second
time to offer that animal&rsquo;s blood.  </p>

<p>Again, God is letting us know that this is all a tableau. 
It was true history, but it is a historical parable that we are reading in the
Gospel accounts of Jesus suffering and dying and being raised from the dead. 
It had already happened, and so that was the second time.  </p>

<p>Also in Leviticus 16:32-34, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priest&rsquo;s office in his father&rsquo;s stead, shall make
the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, <i>even </i>the holy
garments: And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall
make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar,
and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
congregation. And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did
as JEHOVAH commanded Moses.</p>

<p>The linen clothes are to be used for making the atonement. 
What ties in with what Peter and probably John are seeing in the Gospel
accounts when they go into the tomb and find the linen clothes lying, we find
right in the middle of Leviticus 16 in Leviticus 16:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy <i>place, </i>and
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live
goat:</p>

<p>There is language about the scapegoat, and then in verse 23,
Leviticus 16:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the
holy <i>place, </i>and shall leave them there:  </p>

<p>This is the point of the linen clothes in the tomb, that
Christ was the high priest, not after the family of Levi but after the order of
Melchisedec, who was a greater type, as Melchisedec was actually God making an
appearance in the Old Testament.  </p>

<p>So Jesus was a greater High Priest than any of the Levites
because Levi, actually, in the loins of Abraham, paid tithes to Melchisedec,
the Bible tells us.  Christ was performing His duty in making these things
manifest of His atoning work and resurrection.  After He was finished with
death, after He had defeated death&mdash;He had offered up Himself as the sacrifice,
as the Great High Priest&mdash;then He took off His linen clothes, folded them, and
left them lying right there where they were, as the high priest was to do on
the Day of Atonement as he came out of the Holy of Holies.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  Let us have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p>Dear Father, we do thank You for Your Book and Your Word,
the Bible.  Father, we thank You for Sunday, this day, Your Holy Day, and we
ask that we would delight in it and that we would not desire for this day to
pass, that we would enjoy all the things that You have given us to do.  We do
pray that You would help us to honor You on this day and to go about Your
business and to be involved in spiritual activities, whether it be reading the
Bible or praying or handing out tracts or maybe writing letters related, as we
write people and we share information about the Gospel with them, or calling
people.  We pray that You would bless the day for us and strengthen us by it,
and may it be a blessing for each one for the coming week.  Father, we, once
again, thank You for Your great work that we could never add anything to, lest
we come under the curse.  Father, we thank You for the deliverance that You
have provided and the resurrection of the dead, which is our great hope.  We
pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>If anybody has a
question or a comment that you would like to make, you are welcome.  You can
come up to the mic, if you are here.  If you are on Paltalk, raise your hand.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:</i>  </b>Could you explain 1
Peter 2:24?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>1 Peter 2:24 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that
we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were
healed.  </p>

<p>We have to keep in mind that Christ died for sin; He bore
sins before the foundation of the world.  He was not bearing sins in 33 A.D.
while He was crucified on the tree.  Well, then, doesn&rsquo;t this say that He was
bearing sins in His own body on the tree?  </p>

<p>What God is doing is that He is using language to teach us
about the nature of Christ&rsquo;s death as a &ldquo;lamb slain&rdquo; from before the foundation
of the world.  Was Jesus a lamb before the foundation of the world?  There were
not even lambs.  There were no animals created in this world at that time, and
yet the Bible says that He was a &ldquo;lamb.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, likewise, He was not hanging on a tree before the
foundation of the world, but He suffered shame.  He suffered terrible shame. 
As God poured out His wrath upon Him, He became a curse.  </p>

<p>So everything that the cross points to, as far as the one
who hangs on a tree is accursed or bearing shame (as He hung there nakedly on
the cross), is language that God is using to describe Christ&rsquo;s death from
before the world began, and so He can say that He bore sins on a tree from
before the foundation of the world, even though there were no trees.  There was
no cross at that point, just like there were no lambs.  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </i></b>Chris, with respect
to what you just said, why was there no tree?  God is God.  He could have a
tree out in wherever?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>I do not think that God
wants us to think in that direction.  He wants us to understand something. 
Keep in mind, the Bible says that Jesus was a &ldquo;lamb.&rdquo;  Was He transformed into
a lamb?  No.  Even though God is God, He was not transformed into a lamb and
neither was He hanging on a tree.  He suffered what the law required for the
payment of sin and that involves great shame.  He became a curse in our place,
and that is what the cross points to.  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>I
understand that, but the word in the Bible says &ldquo;on the tree.&rdquo;  If God in His Word,
which is true, says &ldquo;on the tree&rdquo;&mdash;and I am assuming that this comports with the
Greek&mdash;if He says that He hung on a tree, then who are we to say, &ldquo;No, it was
not a tree&rdquo;?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Using that kind of idea,
that is how many people look at the Bible, &ldquo;What the Bible says, I believe,&rdquo;

yet we know that the Bible uses figures and types, like the beast coming up out
of the sea, like Jesus being a lamb.  Here, He is describing Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice
as though He bore sin on a tree before the foundation of the world.  There was
no tree; there was no world or any of the things that we currently have in our
world.  That just is not possible.  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):</i>  </b>To say
that there was no tree and that there was no world, we know that there was no
world, but that is not what that verse is saying.  If He said it was a tree out
there in space, wherever it was, why could there not be a tree?  There is
nothing to say that there was not, and we do have this that says that there
was.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Yes, but you are not
understanding how God is writing this verse.  You are not understanding the
nature of what He is referring to as the &ldquo;tree.&rdquo;  Just using your argument,
somebody can go to Revelation 13 or they can go to John 1&mdash;where John the
Baptist said, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God&rdquo;&mdash;but is Jesus a lamb?  No.  Why is He
called a lamb?  </p>

<p>God expects us to search this out and we see that it is a reference
to the sacrifices, to the sacrificial system.  Here, too, He has given us a
great tableau, a great historical picture of what happened before the
foundation of the world.  In that picture, there is a tree, but there was no
tree from eternity past; there was no tree that Christ hung on.  </p>

<p><b><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </i></b>I guess in 1 Peter
2:24, I trouble over it, too.  It also says &ldquo;by whose stripes ye were healed,&rdquo;
so we would also have to assume that Christ had stripes and that does not fit. 
</p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Right.  Yes, that goes
along with it.  The whipping that Jesus suffered was to teach us the punishment
that He endured, that He was afflicted for our sins, as it says in Isaiah 53,
which I think that verse comes from.  In Isaiah 53:4-5:    </p>

<p class="verse">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he <i>was </i>wounded
for our transgressions, <i>he was </i>bruised for our iniquities: the
chastisement of our peace <i>was </i>upon him; and with his stripes we are
healed.  </p>

<p>This took place, we know&mdash;and I know that this is not an easy
concept for us to understand because we are so used to, it is engrained in us
to look at the cross&mdash;and yet, no, God has taught us and recently (this is new)
that Jesus was the Lamb slain.  He was the Lamb because He was the sacrifice
for sins.  He was punished by God, which this language of stripes points to,
for the sins of His people exclusively.  </p>

<p>We could start putting all kinds of things back into
eternity past, but God does not teach us any of that.  He just says that Christ
died for sin and then He rose again.  If we start saying that there was a tree
or whips, then we are not going the right way.  </p>

<p><b><i>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>Jesus in the garden
 of Gethsemane, as He prayed, great drops of blood came off of His face.  I was
hoping that maybe you could try to explain that.  Also, an angel of the Lord
came down and strengthened Him.  If that is Jesus, then Jesus&hellip;?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Yes, how we are going to
figure that out, I do not know.</p>

<p>As far as the great drops of blood, the Bible tells us that
the blood is the life thereof, and so He was giving up His life and, again,
showing what He had to suffer.  He was in an agony and He was suffering, but He
was not making payment a second time.  </p>

<p>This is what we have to stay away from, because that is not
justice.  When all of our sins were paid for, that settled the account and
there could not have been a second payment for sin in any way.  </p>

<p><b><i>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>It looks like there
were two earthquakes concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection: one in Matthew
27:51-53 when He died, the other in Matthew 28:2 when He resurrected.  Is this
correct?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>It appears to say this,
but I would not say this absolutely because there are a lot of things that I
would still want to check out before I would say something like that.  It looks
that way, but I think there is much more; there are many more verses to look
at.     </p>

<p><b><i>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>Revelation 16:18, I
was wondering if the believers will be on the earth when the earthquake hits.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Revelation 16:18 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so
mighty an earthquake, <i>and </i>so great.</p>

<p>This is a chapter that is dealing with that five-month
period of time.  Again, we find language of an earthquake here and also in
Revelation 6 that is dealing with that five-month period of time.  There is a
lot more evidence that is pointing to that.  </p>

<p>Will the believers be here?  I do not think that it matters
because when Christ speaks and the ground opens up and the bodies of the saints
are rejoined with their souls that have been in heaven for however long, at
that point, it says in 1 Thessalonians 4, we will be caught up.  Maybe we
experience a little shaking, but it is not an important point.  </p>

<p>For instance, in Hebrews 12, the Lord gives us a very good
thing to think about.  In Hebrews 12:26-28, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this <i>word,
</i>Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as
of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore
we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may
serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</p>

<p>This is the thing for us to think about.  The new heaven and
new earth&mdash;that Kingdom of God&mdash;can never be shaken.  This just shows us the
instability of this world.  God is going to shake the whole earth.  </p>

<p>So if we experience any part of the earthquake, that is
nothing at all because God&rsquo;s people will be so comforted and consoled by what
is going on that it will not matter.  Immediately, we are with the Lord.  And
after the five months, it will be a new heaven and a new earth.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
