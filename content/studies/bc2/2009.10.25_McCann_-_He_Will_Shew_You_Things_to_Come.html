<p>Let us turn to John 16.  We have been looking at this for
the last couple of weeks.  Let me read from verse 1 of John 16.  We read in
John 16:1-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the <span class="underline">time</span>
cometh&hellip; </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;time&rdquo; is actually &ldquo;hour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the [<i>hour</i>] cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think
that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they
have not known the Father, nor me. But these things have I told you, that when
the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things
I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go my
way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But
because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless
I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not
away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him
unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me; Of
righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment,
because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but
whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that </i>shall he speak: and he will show you
things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
show <i>it </i>unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore
said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show <i>it </i>unto you.  </p>

<p>Then also in verse 25, John 16:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the <span class="underline">time</span>
cometh&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same Greek word <i>hora</i>.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the [<i>hour</i>] cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you
in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.  </p>

<p>We will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>We were looking last time at how God identifies the Great
Tribulation period that we are now in as &ldquo;<b>the hour</b>.&rdquo;  It is &ldquo;<b>the hour
of his judgment</b>&rdquo; according to Revelation 14:7, which says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  </p>

<p>The Lord speaks of the Great Tribulation period as &ldquo;<b>an
hour</b>.&rdquo;  This is why Revelation 8:1 says:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the first 2300-day period of the Great
Tribulation.  It was not &ldquo;<b>half an hour</b>&rdquo;; it was not a half of the full
23 years.  It was actually 6 years and a few months.  But God is very exact,
and so He says, &ldquo;<b>about&hellip;half an hour</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because this time that we are currently in is
identified in the Bible as &ldquo;<b>an hour</b>.&rdquo;  This is the time of the Great
Tribulation, which includes the latter rain of God&rsquo;s plan to save a great
multitude, a period of time in which we have about 18 months and a few days
left.  </p>

<p>We find in John 16 that in that hour people will be killing
the true believers by putting them out of the synagogue.  We also find in John
16 that Jesus says in John 16:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.   </p>

<p>He was speaking to the disciples in the first century A.D.,
but He was really speaking to the whole church age.  He was saying, &ldquo;You cannot
bear the information about the time of the end, about the five months of
torment,&rdquo; all of these teachings that have always been in the Bible but the
Lord had not opened up because He was saving it until today.  He was saving it
for our time.  This was when He was going to reveal it.  </p>

<p>After saying, &ldquo;<b>ye cannot bear them now</b>,&rdquo; Jesus says
in John 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come&hellip;  </p>

<p>When the Holy Spirit, &ldquo;<b>the Spirit of truth, <span class="underline">is come</span></b>,&rdquo;
then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he will guide you into all truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This could not have been a reference to Acts 2 when the Holy
Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost because the churches were not
guided &ldquo;<b>into all truth</b>.&rdquo;  That is pretty evident.  They have many
doctrinal errors and they hold onto them tightly.  They are not going to let
them go.  There are hardly two churches that agree with one another, which
shows us that many of them are incorrect about many of the things that they
teach.  </p>

<p>But God had a plan and He is working out this plan currently
to send the Holy Spirit a second time.  We could call this the second Jubilee
or the latter rain.  It is the second outpouring of the Spirit when the Lord
stretches forth His hand a &ldquo;<b>second time</b>&rdquo;, as it says in Isaiah 11, &ldquo;<b>to
recover the remnant of his people</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Jesus healed a blind man but not immediately.  He touched
him and at once the man could suddenly see.  When you are blind, you cannot see
anything; so he could suddenly see but he saw &ldquo;<b>men as trees, walking</b>.&rdquo; 
He could not see clearly.  This is because this was a reference to God opening
up the eyes of men.  </p>

<p>On the one hand, the Gospel went into the world during the
church age and God accomplished His purposes through the church, even though it
was not a very great time of salvation in the world through the church age. 
Isaiah 9 tells us that there was not &ldquo;<b>the joy in the harvest</b>&rdquo; that had
been expected.  This is because we know that when there is salvation, there is
joy in Heaven; but the church age did not have that joy as much.  </p>

<p>However, God has saved the best for last and now that we are
at the time of the end, He is speaking, as it goes on to say in John 16:13. 
Again, &ldquo;<b>the Spirit of truth, is come</b>,&rdquo; and:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of
himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that </i>shall he speak: and he will
show you things to come. </p>

<p>The Spirit is speaking at this time.  However, we have to be
careful in our understanding of this because there are so many churches that
would agree with this, &ldquo;Oh, yes, brother, the Spirit is speaking because I had
a dream last night,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I had a revelation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God gave me a tongue.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, this is not what the Bible means.  The Spirit is not
speaking in the churches and congregations that are adding to the Word of God and
thinking that they are getting direct divine revelation from God Himself.  </p>

<p>God finished the Bible in the first century A.D.  He told us
in the last chapter of the book of Revelation, Revelation 22, that we are not
to add to the words of the Bible.  Therefore, the Holy Spirit is not speaking
through a supernatural means today anywhere in the world.  He is not whispering
truths to people in their ears at night.  No, He is not doing this.  He is
speaking through the Bible.  </p>

<p>God tells us that when we compare spiritual with spiritual, the
Holy Spirit teaches.  It says in 1 Corinthians 2, &ldquo;<b>the Holy Ghost teacheth</b>.&rdquo; 
In order to teach, you have to communicate, you have to speak.  Therefore, when
the Bible tells us, &ldquo;<b>the Holy Ghost teacheth</b>,&rdquo; it means that He is
speaking.  </p>

<p>He has always done this throughout history, but God has in
mind a special period of time when the Holy Ghost is going to really go to the
forefront in bringing understanding of the Bible.  It is a time when He is
going to reveal truths to us.  </p>

<p>If we go to Hebrews 1:1, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets,  </p>

<p>We can summarize this by saying that God spoke in the Old
Testament.  That is what this is looking at.  God spoke in the Old Testament.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Hebrews 1:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by <i>his </i>Son&hellip;  </p>

<p>Jesus spoke in the New Testament.  Therefore, even though
God is One and all Scripture is given by God and the Holy Ghost moved men of
old to write down what we find in the Bible, the words of God, the Holy Ghost
and Christ and the Father are all involved in the giving of revelation. 
Another way of looking at this is that God is breaking up the revelation of the
Bible or the covenants of the Bible into periods.  </p>

<p>God the Father spoke &ldquo;<b>by the prophets</b>&rdquo;; that is the
Old Testament.  Jesus spoke &ldquo;<b>in these last days</b>&rdquo;; that is the New
Testament.  But a little later on in the book of Hebrews, we have learned that
God found fault &ldquo;<b>with them</b>,&rdquo; and yet He has to finish the covenant.  He
has to complete it, but not through any additional books or additional
revelation.  He has to complete it in the sense of giving His people a better
understanding of the Word of God.  </p>

<p>The first Testament, the Old Testament, was fuzzy to man. 
This is because we start off with thick heads and do not understand much of
anything spiritually.  However, God did give some understanding through the
sacrifices in types and figures of the Messiah.  </p>

<p>Then in the New Testament, God opened it up even further. 
At that point, it could be seen how much of the Old Testament was really
pointing to the Messiah, as well as other information like the Gentiles coming in
and also being heirs of God and recipients of God&rsquo;s grace.  </p>

<p>These are the two periods that God found fault with in the
sense that they were mysterious and could not be properly understood. 
Therefore, He is going to finish the covenant and He is going to do this by
having the Holy Spirit speak.  </p>

<p>Look at Mark 13.  Because this is a parallel chapter to
Matthew 24, we will see Jesus&rsquo; response to the question of the disciples, &ldquo;<b>What
<i>shall be </i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world</b>?&rdquo;  It
says in Mark 13:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when they shall lead <i>you, </i>and deliver you up, take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a very unusual command of God because God tells us
to &ldquo;<b>meditate upon these things</b>&rdquo; and to &ldquo;<b><i>be </i>ready always to <i>give
</i>an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you</b>.&rdquo; 
To do this, you have to &ldquo;<b>study to show thyself approved unto God</b>.&rdquo;  But
here God is saying, &ldquo;No, forget that.  Do not mediate.  Do not study.  Do not
prepare anything.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why?  Why would He say this?  There is only one explanation
and that is because the Word was &ldquo;<b>closed up and sealed till the time of the
end</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we could name any theologian of the past that we would
want to who would have gone into the book of Revelation and other end-time
passages of the Bible who thought that they understood and who made their
commentaries and wrote their theological books; yet at the same time, we now
know that they did not have it correct.  They did not properly understand what
the Bible was saying, and so their teachings on a-mill
and post-mill and pre-mill were not correct because they did not have a right
understanding of the end of time.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on in Mark 13:11 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye&hellip; 
</p>

<p>This is what we are doing.  This is all that we are doing. 
We are speaking what has been given to us.  This is because if God gives it to
us, He expects us to share it, to disclose it, to warn other people, as we know
this is also information concerning the most important thing there is, which is
that the world is coming to an end and our time is short; therefore, we speak
it.  </p>

<p>We are &ldquo;<b>ambassadors for </b><b>Chris</b><b>t</b>.&rdquo;  He
has sent His people into the world, and an ambassador just simply says, &ldquo;This
is what my king wants to communicate to you.&rdquo;  Then we give a tract that warns
about May 21, 2011 being Judgment Day, or all of the other information, and we
are only being obedient to the King, to the One who has sent us.  It is as
simple as that.  </p>

<p>But notice that God says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but whatsoever shall be given you <span class="underline">in that hour</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. 
</p>

<p>Again, the Holy Ghost is speaking in this hour.  </p>

<p>Let us go to a couple of the other gospels, such as Luke.  In
Luke 12:11-12; it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and <i>unto </i>magistrates,
and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye
shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to
say.  </p>

<p>The Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit is, once again, showing us, &ldquo;Do
not concern yourself with trying to uncover all of these kinds of deep truths
in the Bible that are in the book of Revelation or Ezekiel or Daniel, which are
concerning the end.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The theologians of the past could have saved themselves tons
of trouble by not even getting into it.  Of course, even this warning or this
information that God is telling us concerning not to take any thought was also
sealed up, and so we have to understand that there was no way that they could
have known this.  But still, if they would have just left it as it was and not
really gotten into it, that would have been better.  That would have been much
better than to develop teachings that are not true and that are false.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Matthew 10:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For
it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.  </p>

<p>Again and again and again, the Holy Spirit speaks, not you. 
This is why it is so dangerous.  It is beyond dangerous for someone to hear
these truths that are coming from the Bible and to claim, &ldquo;Heretic!&rdquo; or to say,

&ldquo;It is a false gospel; it is a perversion of the truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>People are very imaginative when it comes to speaking evil
and they can phrase a response in many, many different ways.  However, they
need to stop and think because God is speaking of &ldquo;<b>that hour</b>,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;<b>the
hour of his judgment</b>.&rdquo;  It is the time of the Great Tribulation, and He, the
Holy Ghost, is saying, &ldquo;I will speak in that hour, not you.  You should not
even think about it.  I will speak.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I think that we can see the danger.  We can see the danger
of attacking information that is coming from the Bible that God had closed up
until a certain period of time, the time of the end that we are now in.  In
some cases, people are viciously going against those who they think are
bringing this kind of teaching.  But, you see, it is never the people.  God
told Samuel, &ldquo;<b>For they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me</b>.&rdquo; 
And Jesus told the disciples as they were going out two-by-two that if they
were rejected, He was the One who was actually being rejected.  It was Christ
Himself whom they are rejecting, as long as what we are sharing is true and
faithful.  </p>

<p>To even further drive this home, let us go to Habakkuk 2:1: 
</p>

<p class="verse">I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower&hellip;  </p>

<p>God tells us repeatedly in the Gospels, &ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>Watch
therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It also says this in Mathew 24.  Someone had brought this
verse up to me recently.  They were thinking that this teaches that we will not
know, but actually it is the opposite.  It says in Matthew 24:42:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
</p>

<p>Right.  We did not know what hour.  We were in the dark
because God had sealed up the Word.  However, the key phrase here is &ldquo;<b>Watch
therefore</b>.&rdquo;  Why?  Because you do not know the hour.  </p>

<p>Are we to be watching on our rooftops, looking for the signs
of His coming?  Are we to be gazing up into the stars like a child on Christmas
Eve looking for Santa?  Is that what it means to watch?</p>

<p>No, it means to look in the Bible.  Keep reading the Bible. 
Keep studying the Bible.  Keep doing it the proper way, &ldquo;<b>comparing spiritual
things with spiritual</b>,&rdquo; making sure that your conclusions harmonize.  At
the right time at the end, God will bless that methodology that His people have
seen from the Scriptures.  He will open up their eyes and their understanding
and then we will then know the time.  </p>

<p>Revelation 3:2-3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be watchful&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, watch in the Scriptures.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die:
for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou
hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not
watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou [<i>you</i>] shalt not know
what hour I will come upon thee.  </p>

<p>That is if you do not watch.  If you do not watch, you are
going to be in the dark.  Jesus will come &ldquo;<b>as a thief in the night</b>.&rdquo; 
You are going to be caught off-guard, &ldquo;Oh, why did someone not warn me?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, they passed by tracts on the street and they
turned the radio dial, but God is warning.  God is telling us.  He is sharing
it with the whole world.  It is really going to cover the earth &ldquo;<b>as the
waters cover the sea</b>,&rdquo; but people maybe quickly dismissed this in their
life or thought, &ldquo;How ridiculous that is!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is interesting when we share with someone out in the
world.  We share this information from the Bible and we can go into pretty good
detail, &ldquo;This is why May 21, 2011 is going to be the end.&rdquo;  We might be telling
this to someone who is maybe showing some interest, but this person is with a
friend.  They turn to their friend and their friend kind of smirks and says, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; 
Now all of a sudden because of that one reaction, the person who was showing
some interest is going to write it off because they are fearful of what their
friend will think and of what the world will think about them.  </p>

<p>What evidence did the friend give?  A smirk?  &ldquo;Oh, really,&rdquo;
like he knows something?  An individual who is only here a few short years and
who has a tiny, finite mind is able to comprehend more than eternal God?  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is the nature of man.  People are going
to go to their destruction because they listened to their friends who they
thought knew something.  Of course, on that day when May 21 comes, their friend
is not going to be able to help them.  Their friend is not going to be there
because they are going to have their own concerns.  This is what the Bible
tells us.  </p>

<p>You see, people really give too much weight to other people
and not enough weight to the Word of God, to the Bible, to God who created them
and who is going to judge them.  Is this not how it is in many cases?  </p>

<p>Going back to Habakkuk 2:1-2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will
watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am
reproved. And JEHOVAH answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it </i>plain
upon tables&hellip;  </p>

<p>And John 16:25 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you
plainly of the Father.  </p>

<p>In Habakkuk 2:2-3, Habakkuk is told to keep watch because it
is going to be made:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.  For the
vision <i>is </i>yet for an appointed time, but at the end <span class="underline">it</span> shall
speak&hellip;  </p>

<p>Have you ever heard an &ldquo;it&rdquo; speak?  How does an &ldquo;it&rdquo; speak? 
Is not an &ldquo;it&rdquo; a thing?  A chair cannot speak, a table cannot speak, but God
can speak.  </p>

<p>So we need to correct this personal pronoun:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but at the end [<i>he</i>] shall speak&hellip;</p>

<p>This is because we always have to make a decision when we
are faced with a pronoun.  What is the correct pronoun, &ldquo;he,&rdquo; &ldquo;she,&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>We could have a sentence like, &ldquo;My wife, <span class="underline">she</span> looks
beautiful.&rdquo;  But we would not say, &ldquo;My wife, <span class="underline">it</span> looks beautiful.&rdquo;  We would
not say this because &ldquo;it&rdquo; is a person.  &ldquo;It&rdquo; is &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is the same thing here in Habakkuk 2:3.  At the end, &ldquo;it&rdquo;
is not going to speak.  &ldquo;He&rdquo; is going to speak, God Himself:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and not lie: though [<i>he</i>] tarry, wait for [<i>him</i>];
because [<i>he</i>] will surely come, [<i>he</i>] will not tarry.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 10 makes a correction on the pronoun as it is
referring back to this verse.  In Hebrews 10:37, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</p>

<p>We can see how God has really told us repeatedly that He is
going to speak.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Daniel 12:9-10, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are </i>closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white,
and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand; but the wise shall understand.  </p>

<p>This is referring to two groups of people.  One is wicked;
the other is wise.  This is how God divides the human race.  To say this
another way, it is the foolish or the wise, like in Matthew 25.  There are two
groups: the saved and the unsaved.  Once someone becomes saved, they become
wise.  This is because Christ, who is wisdom, indwells them.  Therefore, they
have wisdom.  They have Christ.  They have the Spirit of God within.  This is
what God is saying when He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the wise shall understand.  </p>

<p>It is not the intellectual.  It is not the learned.  It is
not the one who is knowledgeable of the things of the earth who will
understand.  It is the wise whom God has saved and the wicked are all of the
rest.  The wicked will not understand.  </p>

<p>It is significant that it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;none of the wicked shall understand&hellip;  </p>

<p>Not just most, but none of the wicked will understand.  This
is referring to the words that are &ldquo;<b>closed up and sealed till the time of
the end</b>.&rdquo;  This is when at the end, the seal is taken off, the Word is
opened, and God&rsquo;s people now can understand.  </p>

<p>In Luke 24, we read where &ldquo;<b>opened he their understanding</b>&rdquo;
as they were speaking with Him after His resurrection.  This is the same thing
that God is doing now.  The wicked will not understand but the wise will.  </p>

<p>This fits in with Ecclesiasts 8:5, which says:</p>

<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.  </p>

<p>This is referring to God&rsquo;s elect people.  They discern and
are able to understand two things: &ldquo;<b>time and judgment</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When Jonah went to Nineveh and said, &ldquo;<b>Yet forty days, and
</b><b>Nineveh</b><b> shall be overthrown</b>,&rdquo; what two elements can we say
were in this single sentence?  What two things?  This statement contained time
(forty days) and judgment (they would be overthrown at the end of forty days). 
</p>

<p>They were given the exact year, month, and day.  They knew
all of this information.  They could calculate this and knew, &ldquo;Forty days from
this point will lead to our destruction as a city.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is saying that the wise are able to discern, to
understand time and judgment, but none of the wicked can discern this.  You
see, this is the problem.  It really boils down to this.  The Ninevites were
given a one-sentence warning.  That is all the evidence it took, &ldquo;Here you go. 
You have forty days and Nineveh, this great city, will be overthrown.&rdquo;  They
believed God and the whole city from the king on down repented, sat in sackcloth
and ashes, and cried mightily to God.  </p>

<p>We would think that if we had not been given the information
that Jonah went in there with such flimsy evidence or such a flimsy message
from God, that God must have bombarded that city with truth and warnings, one
after another, &ldquo;You have forty days!  That is all that you have!&rdquo;  Over a
period of time of constantly hearing this, we would think that they eventually
repented as God moved in them.  </p>

<p>But, no; it was not that way at all.  He was one prophet
without the electronic medium, without literature, with nothing, someone who
was just spit out of the belly of the whale and who must have had an odor about
him and who was disheveled.  He goes into the city and he speaks like a
foreigner, someone who would not be able to hide his accent, if he even spoke
in their language at all, which we do not know.  However, they believed.  </p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, many today are offered a tract, &ldquo;Here,
would you like a tract?  This comes right from the Bible.&rdquo;  You hand them the
tract, &ldquo;HOLY GOD will bring Judgment Day on MAY 21, 2011&rdquo; or the tract &ldquo;May 21, 2011 Judgment Day!&rdquo; where verse after verse after verse is offered.  Or
you give them the booklet <i>We Are Almost There!</i> that has about 70 pages
or <i>Time Has an End</i> that has over 300 pages of Biblical evidence.  We put
this stuff at people&rsquo;s feet and they do not see it.  They do not agree with
it.  They do not understand.  They do not get it.  </p>

<p>Why not?  It is not because they are naï.  As far as the
attitude of man and my attitude, I can be very cynical.  Well, this is not
cynicism because this is the truth: the whole church world is dead, spiritually
speaking.  There is no truth in any of the churches and I would not step foot
in any church.  But God&rsquo;s people can be very skeptical and cynical because they
must hear that voice that is only Christ&rsquo;s voice and no other voice. 
Therefore, they are really some of the most cynical people who are out there
concerning gospels, and yet God&rsquo;s people hear and believe while others do not. 
</p>

<p>Jesus summarized this in John 8:47, which I refer to a lot
because I think that it is necessary.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>None of the wicked shall understand</b>.&rdquo;  Not one, we
could say.  This is similar to what God says in Romans 3, &ldquo;<b>There is none
righteous, no, not one</b>,&rdquo; and none of the wicked will understand.  </p>

<p>Look also at Proverbs 28:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Evil men understand not judgment&hellip;  </p>

<p>But wise men understand &ldquo;<b>both time and judgment</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek JEHOVAH
understand all.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Evil men</b>,&rdquo; are these the murderers, the terrorists,
the child abusers?  Are these who this is looking at?  Are these the &ldquo;<b>evil
men</b>&rdquo; who will not understand?  </p>

<p>No, the Bible tells us, &ldquo;<b>For all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>there is none righteous, no, not one</b>.&rdquo; 
We have transgressed His Law.  Therefore, in God&rsquo;s sight we are evil if we do
not have a Saviour.  </p>

<p>This means, again, that <span class="underline">none of the wicked</span>&mdash;none of
the people of the world, none of the people of the church&mdash;will understand. 
They are not going to understand anymore than a person in the world if they are
not saved.  Since God is commanding His people to come out of the churches and
congregations, someone who is one of God&rsquo;s elect is going to be drawn in that
way and they will leave the churches, indicating that they are understanding
what the Bible is saying at this time.  </p>

<p>Let us go to 2 Peter 2 where I will read from verse 9.  2
Peter 2:9-10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: But chiefly
them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise
government. Presumptuous <i>are they, </i>selfwilled, they are not afraid to <span class="underline">speak
evil </span>of dignities.  </p>

<p>These two English words &ldquo;<b>speak evil</b>&rdquo; are the same
Greek word that is often translated &ldquo;blaspheme.&rdquo;  Blaspheming the Holy Spirit
is basically speaking evil of the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>2 Peter 2:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
railing accusation against them before the Lord. But these, as natural brute
beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, <span class="underline">speak evil</span>&hellip; </p>

<p>Again, that is the word that is translated as &ldquo;blaspheme.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;speak evil of the things that they understand not&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Evil men understand not judgment.&rdquo;  They do not get it. 
They do not get it.  Therefore, the believer who shares this information with
someone&mdash;and we share it with everyone because we do not know who is the elect
and who is not&mdash;they mock it or they laugh it off or they reject it or they rip
it up.  Maybe they are in the church and just call you a false prophet, or
they, etc., etc., etc.  </p>

<p>Why do they do that?  Why do they &ldquo;<b>speak evil</b>&rdquo; of
these things?  This is because they do not understand judgment.  They &ldquo;<b>speak
evil of the things that they understand not</b>.&rdquo;  They do not get it; and if
God does not intervene, they will never get it.  They are never going to
understand that this day is close at hand.  </p>

<p>Here we are 572 days away from Judgment Day and this is
being freely shared with as many as will listen.  We are warning people.  We
are sharing with people repeatedly and we are finding that, of course, many
will not understand.  They do not understand, and so they &ldquo;<b>speak evil</b>.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>On the tract that we put out, the &ldquo;May 21, 2011 Judgment Day!&rdquo; tract, there is a contact address on the back.  This is increasing, so
this tells me that this is a good indicator that more and more people are
hearing and that the tract is getting further out there because people are
contacting us.  Many times, what they write in response is not very pleasant nor
is it very kind.  Sometimes, it is very harsh.  They are really speaking evil
because they cannot understand.  They just cannot understand what God is doing,
but the wise understand.  </p>

<p>You see, the difference between the wise and the wicked is
in God&rsquo;s hands.  This is because none of us would understand anything either
unless the Lord mercifully and graciously gave us insight, as He is doing at
this time in all of these things.  </p>

<p>But, you know, there is a question that has to be asked I
think.  We are living at a time when the Holy Spirit is speaking and many
people are speaking evil of what they are hearing, which refers to this word &ldquo;blaspheme.&rdquo; 
Since they are doing this, are they blaspheming the Holy Ghost?  Is this the
sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost when people are so angry and upset and
railing on these kinds of teachings that they are hearing?  They are definitely
saying that this is not of God, &ldquo;It is not of God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us go back to Luke 12.  We read a couple of verses there
about the Holy Ghost speaking in that hour.  Go back one verse from where we
previously read in Luke 12.  It says in Luke 12:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it
shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and <i>unto
</i>magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same
hour what ye ought to say.</p>

<p>This is an interesting place to put a verse that speaks of
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  In the verse above, God is getting into His speaking
in that hour and He puts these verses right next to each other, side-by-side.  </p>

<p>In Mark 3, God explains what blaspheming the Holy Spirit
is.  Turn to Mark 3.  It says in Mark 3:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</p>

<p>Then we read in Mark 3:28-30:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: But he that
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger
of eternal damnation: Because <span class="underline">they</span> said, He hath an unclean spirit.  </p>

<p>This is the sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>The Bible is so precise and so exact because look at what
God says in Hebrews 9:21-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged with
blood&hellip;  </p>

<p>Not all sin, not all things, &ldquo;<b>almost all</b>&rdquo; because
there is one sin that cannot be forgiven, just one sin, and that is the sin of
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>Now go to 1 John 5 where we find a very interesting verse. 
It says in 1 John 5:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">If any man see his brother sin a sin <i>which is </i>not unto
death&hellip;  </p>

<p>Let us stop right there.  What sin is &ldquo;<b>not unto death</b>&rdquo;? 
The Bible says, &ldquo;<b>the wages of sin <i>is </i>death</b>,&rdquo; which is referring
to all sin.  It is the little white lie, it is murder, and it is all the sins
in between.  The Bible says, &ldquo;<b>the wages of sin <i>is </i>death</b>,&rdquo; and so
at first we can be confused.  What could God be saying?  This does not seem to
make sense.  </p>

<p class="verse">If any man see his brother sin a sin <i>which is </i>not unto
death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
death&hellip; </p>

<p>When we ask God, we are praying to God.  So if you see
anyone who sins a sin &ldquo;<b>not unto death,</b>&rdquo; you can pray for them.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, it goes on:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for
it.  </p>

<p>This has to be, it has to be the sin of blaspheming the Holy
Spirit.  There is no other sin that you are not to pray for.  There is no other
sin where it makes sense for God to tell us not to pray for it.  He says not to
pray for it because it is unpardonable.  There is no forgiveness for
blaspheming the Holy Spirit, so why pray?</p>

<p>Now we can understand the first part of the verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">If any man see his brother sin a sin <i>which is </i><span class="underline">not unto
death</span>&hellip;   </p>

<p>That is, it is a sin that is not forgivable.  All sin is
forgivable, which is the great mercy of God.  You can&mdash;and people have&mdash;cursed
God, yelled at God, shook their fist at God.  All of this is forgivable and you
can pray for them that they might be saved, but there is one sin that is not
forgivable.  </p>

<p>We see two very large characteristics of the sin of
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  There is no salvation.  As it said in Mark 3,
there is &ldquo;<b>never forgiveness</b>.&rdquo;  The other characteristic is &ldquo;<b>I do not
say that he shall pray for it</b>&rdquo;; you do not pray for this.  Those two things
are very big things that really relate to and describe the sin of blaspheming
the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>What about what we read in Jeremiah 7:16 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.  </p>

<p>God is telling people, &ldquo;Do not pray.  Do not pray for this
people.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we have learned, the book of Jeremiah is teaching us
about the Great Tribulation and the churches of today.  It relates to our
modern day and it says, &ldquo;Do not pray for them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why not?  Why not?  Is there not forgiveness for all sin? 
Yes.  However, there is one sin that we do not pray for, only one, and that is
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>Or go to Hebrews 6:4-5, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>it is </i>impossible for those who were once enlightened,
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come,</p>

<p>Keep in mind that God does this often.  He makes a lot of
statements like this where He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>it is </i>impossible&hellip;  </p>

<p>Have this thought in mind as you read Hebrews 6:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>It is impossible</b>,&rdquo; which means no salvation.  </p>

<p>Or look at Hebrews 10:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  </p>

<p>This means no salvation.  </p>

<p>The two elements that are involved with blaspheming the Holy
Spirit&mdash;no salvation and do not bother to pray&mdash;we find in relationship to God&rsquo;s
judgment on the churches and congregations.  There is no salvation, there is no
repentance, and no more sacrifice for sins.  And Jeremiah tells us in two
places, in Jeremiah 7 and in Jeremiah 11, &ldquo;<b>Pray not thou for this people</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>So there is only one conclusion that we can come to.  At the
end, in that hour when the Holy Ghost speaks, when the Holy Ghost teaches,
there will be the judgment of God upon those who blaspheme the Holy Spirit. 
There will be no more salvation, so do not bother to pray.  </p>

<p>This is happening now.  We have to realize that God has given
us so much information about blaspheming the Holy Spirit for a reason.  It is
not just because in the first century the Jewish leaders did this.  It is
because in this hour, the Holy Spirit is speaking.  </p>

<p>What they are doing goes way beyond disrespect.  It goes way
beyond dishonoring God when people are railing on this information that is
coming forth from the Bible.  But God takes personal responsibility because it
is not you who is speaking nor is it Family Radio; it is God who is speaking
and bringing these things up.  </p>

<p>Now the question is: can an individual who has maybe said
some things that were unkind and vicious against this information that God is
opening up be forgiven their sins?  Sure.  Definitely.  Without question.  God
can save any person in all the world.  Any person in any church today could
still potentially become saved.  </p>

<p>How does that work?  If you look at the Greek, does it not
say that for those who blaspheme the Holy Spirit, there is no forgiveness to
all eternity?  </p>

<p>Yes, this is true.  The Jewish leaders, their spiritual
authorities, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, just one of many, their
priests, many of them, would have said the same thing.  Their Pharisees
likewise said this.  They said, &ldquo;Yes, Jesus heals the sick and He does all of
these miracles, but do you know what power is behind it?  The power of the
devil.  The power of Satan and not the power of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As a result of this mindset of the spiritual leaders of Israel,
when God was finished using national Israel and beginning the church age, they
did not follow along.  They did not continue following God, following the Word
of God, following the truth.  God had cut them off and never again in any
synagogue was there salvation.  Therefore, there was no point of praying for
the ministry of the Jewish churches or their synagogues because God was not
there to bless it.  </p>

<p>This is what is going on today.  The two elements of
blaspheming the Holy Spirit are not so much one individual&rsquo;s sin as it is a
corporate sin.  &ldquo;<b>They said</b>,&rdquo; that He did these things through Satan.  If
you look at Mark 3, it is plural.  It was not a person.  It was not just one
scribe.  The scribes came down.  &ldquo;<b>They said</b>&rdquo; that He was under the power
of Satan.  </p>

<p>So God cut off national Israel and never again would He
bless their ministerial work.  They had the Old Testament, and God can save a
person through the Old Testament.  However, they would read it in their
synagogues and it would not bless or benefit anyone spiritually.  There was no
salvation following the end of God&rsquo;s dealings with national Israel.  </p>

<p>Now today, how do we understand Jeremiah 7 where it says, &ldquo;<b>Pray
not thou for this people</b>&rdquo;?  We know that this relates to the church of our
day.  It relates to the church, so can we pray if we are married and our wife is
still in the church?  Can we pray for her that God would save her and draw her
out?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Can we pray for our mother or our father or our
friend?  Yes.  Absolutely.  But we do not pray for the ministry of the church. 
We do not pray for the pastor, &ldquo;O Lord, bless the pastor&rsquo;s sermon today.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why pray for that?  The Holy Spirit came out of the midst. 
God is not there.  There is a famine of hearing in the churches and the
congregations.  There cannot be blessing upon the Word that is preached in the
church, and so we have the two elements.  Do not pray for the corporate body
today, for the churches and congregations.  Do not pray for their missionaries
who are over in Pakistan or India, or wherever they are.  Do not pray that God
would bless their work, because this is an impossibility.  God tells us that in
the churches today, they have &ldquo;<b>no more sacrifice for sins</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>it is
impossible&hellip;to renew them again unto repentance</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because the Lord is finished with the churches and
congregations.  Just as He finished with Israel, He is now finished with the
church.  He has cut them off.  They are under His wrath, under His judgment,
and there is no more salvation possible.  This is what God is saying.  </p>

<p>It is very interesting that we are getting close to seeing
almost the same anger that the Israelites had when the Apostle Paul was
teaching about Jesus.  They would throw dust up into the air and just charge at
him as one man.  They were so angry and furious that these things were being
declared and spoken.  </p>

<p>Today, a lot of that anger is there.  It is a little
restrained.  Actually, on the physical level, it is much more restrained.  But
the same anger is involved as the church is hearing things that, to them, are
blasphemous: the end of the church age, we know when Christ is going to return,
annihilation instead of the teaching of hell, as well as many other things.  </p>

<p>So they are very upset, but they are not upset with you or
with me.  Yes, they are, but not really.  They are upset with what the Holy
Ghost is saying, with what God is revealing from His Word.  </p>

<p>Okay, let us stop here and we will have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p>Dear Father, we do thank You for Your grace.  We thank You
that we are not a church.  O Lord, we know that pride is everywhere and it
would be easy for someone to think that they are wise because they do not go to
church, but we know that it is only by Your grace and by Your doing that we are
able to understand anything from the Bible and that we have been able to understand
that it is time to get out of the church, as well as all of these other things
that You are opening up.  We pray that we might be very humble and in
submission to You and Your Word, even more as we move forward.  Father, we ask
that You will guide us into truth, and we thank You that You are not holding
back.  There is no restraint.  You are leading us into many right
understandings of the Bible.  Father, we pray for everyone here.  We do ask
that You would bless each individual and those who are on Paltalk and others. 
Help each one of us to live this day to Your honor and Your glory and not to
ourselves.  Father, we have lived many days to ourselves.  But in these last
few days, may You move in us to will and to do of Your good pleasure, and may we
live as we always should have lived in obedience to Your Word and in going
forth with Your Word wherever possible.  We pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s
Name.  Amen.  </p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Does anyone have a
question or a comment?  If you do, please come up to the mic.    </p>

<p><b><i>Comment:</i>  </b>Thank you.  I will try to be brief. 
 First of all, my neighbors are &ldquo;rending&rdquo; me because I have cast my pearls
before swine, but that is beside the point.  I am praying for them.  I do not
know if they have blasphemed the Holy Spirit or not.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Excuse me.  I want to
just make this clear.  No individual can blaspheme the Holy Spirit.  It is not
an individual sin.  It is a corporate sin.  &ldquo;<b>They said</b>&rdquo; that He was of
Satan.  Likewise today, if you think about it, we pray for our loved ones or
our neighbors or whomever.  We do not pray for the church.  Why?  Because God
has left them and there is no more of His grace.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </i></b>Thank you.  At the
beginning of your study, you mentioned that the &ldquo;<b>half an hour</b>&rdquo; was not a
literal half hour, not a literal 2300 days.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>No, I did not say that. 
In Revelation 8:1, God says:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I say things that maybe did not come out the right
way.  What I hope I said was that this is referring to the first part of the
Great Tribulation that was 2300 evening/mornings.  It is not an exact dividing
or middle point, so that is why God says, &ldquo;<b>about&hellip;half an hour</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>That is
what I wanted to hear you say.  Thank you.  But in Matthew 27:46, it talks
about the death of Christ, about the crucifixion, and it says &ldquo;<b>about the
ninth hour</b>.&rdquo;  You pointed out that word &ldquo;about&rdquo; in &ldquo;<b>about&hellip;half an hour</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>I thought that this was significant because it matches with
what I have been puzzled over in Zechariah 14:7.  It could be preceding this
verse, but I will start with verse 7.  Zechariah 14:7-8 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But it shall be one day which shall be known to JEHOVAH, not
day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, <i>that </i>at evening time it shall
be light. And it shall be in that day, <i>that </i>living waters shall go out
from Jerusalem&hellip;  </p>

<p>I am interpreting this as a possibility of referring to His coming. 
</p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>I would suggest visiting
Family Radio&rsquo;s Dynamic Bible Question Form on their website or you can contact
Family Radio if you do not have a computer.  But Mr. Camping has done a study
on Zechariah 14:7.  I cannot remember exactly what it is, but it should be
translated differently than we normally read it.  </p>

<p>If you are basing anything on the way in which this is
written, it probably will not be correct.  So I would just suggest that you
listen to that study.    </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):</i>  </b>I was
trying to suggest that Jesus died and went to Heaven with the thief &ldquo;<b>about
the ninth hour</b>.&rdquo;  Therefore, He is going to come &ldquo;<b>about the ninth hour</b>.&rdquo; 
So this is just something for us to figure out.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>I do not know.  You see,
that is the thing.  I have heard different thoughts and yet there is no
conclusive evidence.  If the Bible teaches that we will know the hour, then we
are going to know it I think.  It is going to be conclusive.  But at this
point, it is not.  So each one of us should probably be doing our own study as
you are doing and continue to look until we are sure beyond a shadow of a doubt
that this is what the Bible says.  </p>

<p>We find God saying things like &ldquo;about.&rdquo;  For instance, of
the swine, it says &ldquo;<b>they were about two thousand</b>.&rdquo;  He also says that
there were &ldquo;<b>about two thousand cubits</b>&rdquo; when the ark was crossing the river
  Jordan, but it was not exactly.  This is because God is so precise.  In those
pictures, He is referring to almost 2,000 years from Christ; and yet it is not exactly
2,000 years, so it is &ldquo;about.&rdquo;  It is not an even division of &ldquo;<b>half an hour</b>&rdquo;

at the time of the Great Tribulation, which is 23 years.  It is shorter than
that, so it is &ldquo;<b>about&hellip;half an hour</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </i></b>We were kind of
questioning something in 1 John 5, which talks about blaspheming and that it is
speaking of an individual who sins &ldquo;<b>a sin unto death</b>.&rdquo;  So how can you
say that it is just a corporate sin?  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Because God is just
using this kind of language to explain a particular aspect of this sin, which
is that you do not pray for it.  By giving us this information, it ties into
Jeremiah 7 and Jeremiah 11 where we are told, &ldquo;<b>Pray not thou for this people</b>.&rdquo; 
It is the only sin that could be in view that we are not to pray for, and this
matches with what God told Jeremiah.  </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>What
does it mean to &ldquo;<b>pray for <span class="underline">it</span></b>&rdquo;?  That kind of confuses me.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Well, I do not know.  I
will have to look at that.    </p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>Okay,
but I kind of think that you might be right because I am sure that the Apostle
Paul was one who would have been blaspheming, yet he knew that he was saved.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Paul admits that he was &ldquo;<b>a
blasphemer&hellip;and injurious</b>.&rdquo;  He went to great lengths in order to capture
people who were Christians &ldquo;<b>and haling men and women committed <i>them </i>to
prison</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>compelled <i>them </i>to blaspheme</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  What did he think about Christians? 
He thought that they were not of God.  So who were they of?  </p>

<p>When we recognize false gospels today, we understand that
they are not of God.  Who is behind them?  We would say that it is Satan and
his emissaries.  </p>

<p>The scribes were saying of Jesus that He did things through
the power of darkness or the devil.  So basically they were saying that it was
not a true Gospel and that He was not of God, and that is the sin of
blaspheming the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p><b><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </i></b>Can you look at Luke
21:35.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Luke 21:35 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth.     </p>

<p><b><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>I really
like this verse.  If I was in the churches, it would be very hard to interpret
this verse because if I was in the church and it came as a snare, if you look
at this word &ldquo;snare&rdquo; in the whole Bible, you do not escape from a &ldquo;snare.&rdquo;  So
I was just wanting to know if this is a really good verse to use; because if
you are a true believer, it will not come as a snare.  That would violate all
Scripture.  I just wanted your take on that.       </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>A snare is a trap and it
is set for animals.  A hunter will set a snare in order to capture his prey. 
God is actively fighting against the churches today and the congregations today
and He is judging them.</p>

<p>It says in the previous verse in Luke 21:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares.  </p>

<p>This is the important part that goes along with the snare.  It
is just like a person is walking down a trail through the woods, enjoying the
scenery, when suddenly they step into a bear trap.  A person steps into a bear
trap and it has hold of them but they did not realize it.  </p>

<p>Well, the Lord is saying that if someone is involved with
these other things, which really have to do with spiritual drunkenness and not
going to the Bible in a right manner, then they will be caught off-guard.  1
Thessalonians 5 relates to this.  </p>

<p><b><i>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>Does EBible
Fellowship plan to send a &ldquo;moving billboard&rdquo; and pass out tracts at the Citizens
 Bank Park in Philadelphia for the World Series.  The baseball game is on
Saturday the 31<sup>st</sup> and Sunday the 1<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris</i></b><b><i>:  </i></b>Our &ldquo;moving billboard&rdquo;
is sitting in the back.  Let me clarify something because we did get a phone
call from Coatesville concerning the truck that Robin had wrapped with
information about Judgment Day.  He also has the date of May 21, 2011 and other Scriptures on there.  They thought that it belonged to EBible Fellowship, but
it does not.  Mike has a van, Robin has this truck, and I am sure that other
people have things like this.  But those are individuals who are doing those
things.  </p>

<p>We are looking into billboards.  We are looking into other
ways of announcing what is ahead.  Newspapers are a good idea.  We were able to
arrange something in the Newark newspaper.  We are looking at these kinds of
things and maybe something like bumper stickers, whatever we can think of.  </p>

<p>There was also another person who contacted us who wanted to
know if we could help them get a &ldquo;moving billboard&rdquo; because they saw pictures
of Robin&rsquo;s &ldquo;moving billboard,&rdquo; so I had to explain that this is not what we are
doing right now.  Those things are done by the individuals.  </p>

<p>Is there anyone else?  Any other questions or comments that
anyone has?  Okay, let us have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p>Dear Father, we do thank You for Your grace and Your mercy
and Your compassion and that today is the Day of Salvation.  We have no
promises individually for the future but we do know that today is a day wherein
You are saving.  Father, we pray that You would have mercy on our children, on
our family members, on our neighbors, on our friends, on our co-workers. 
Wherever we are, may You help us to share with them as a watchman what is about
to come, that the sword is about to fall.  We ask also that You would help each
one of us to live as we have never lived before, to live in all holiness and
godliness, to have our conversation honest amongst the Gentiles where they
really would not have genuine reason to speak evil of us.  Father, we pray that
You would grant us Your Spirit, that You would energize us by Your Spirit to
keep Your commandments and to do Your will, that we would find this strength in
You so that we can continue to walk in Thy commandments.  Father, we pray for
the rest of this day, and we thank You once again for Your tremendous grace. 
In Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>
