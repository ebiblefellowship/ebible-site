<p>Let us turn to John 5 where we will begin in verse 22.  We
read in John 5:22-32:    </p>

<p class="verse">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son: That all <i>men </i>should honour the Son, even as they honour
the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath
sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God: and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in
himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; And hath given
him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. Marvel
not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation. I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father
which hath sent me. If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. There
is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he
witnesseth of me is true.  </p>

<p>We probably will not get into verses 31 and 32 about Jesus
saying, &ldquo;I bear witness of myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is another that beareth witness
of me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Remember that the Bible says that &ldquo;the testimony of two men
is true.&rdquo;  The Bible also teaches us that &ldquo;God is one.&rdquo;  He is &ldquo;one God&hellip;one
Lord,&rdquo; but He reveals Himself as three Persons.  </p>

<p>Some people think that God is one God and one Person.  If
this were true, then He could not have a second witness to Himself who is also
God.  So God gave the Law that the testimony of two witnesses is true, and He
is under this Law.  Therefore, there must be at least a second Person of the
Godhead, and we know that there are actually three.  </p>

<p>If God was only one Person, then how could He bear witness
to Himself that the things that He says are true?  We do not understand this
and we cannot really explain how this is, but He is one God who reveals Himself
as three Persons.  We cannot divide God in trying to understand this, but we
know that the Bible teaches this.  </p>

<p>I wanted to look at John 5 because it discusses the
resurrection of the dead.  The resurrection of the dead is not just a topic for
Easter Sunday, especially when the resurrection of the dead is going to happen
next year.  This kind of makes it very pertinent to each one of us that we consider
and think about what the Bible says regarding the resurrection of the dead.  </p>

<p>The hope and the great encouragement to the people of God
for centuries has been that they and maybe some of their family members might
be raised from the dead, that they might rise again and enter into the Kingdom
 of Heaven, into the glorious Kingdom of God and experience eternal life.  </p>

<p>Let us also quickly look at verse 25, John 5:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall
live.   </p>

<p>This has some application to when people hear the Gospel and
God brings them to life.  They are &ldquo;born again.&rdquo;  The Bible speaks of this as &ldquo;the
first resurrection.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Therefore, in that day when people heard the Gospel and God
saved them as a result of His Word, the dead heard the voice of the Son of
God.  They were spiritually dead in their sins when God said to their souls, &ldquo;Arise.&rdquo; 
They became new creatures because God made sure that they heard His voice and
they did become saved.  But there is also an hour coming when the dead will
hear His voice.  This has to do with the graves, with those who are in graves
all over the world.  </p>

<p>Going down to verse 28, we read in John 5:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">Marvel not at this&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is in the context of the resurrection of the dead or of
the dead hearing God&rsquo;s voice:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Marvel</span> not&hellip;  </p>

<p>I looked up this word &ldquo;marvel&rdquo; and I was surprised at how
often this is used in the Bible.  For instance, go to Matthew 8:27.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the men <span class="underline">marvelled</span>, saying, What manner of man is
this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!  </p>

<p>If you look at the previous verse, you will see that this
was when Jesus quieted the storm and &ldquo;the men marvelled.&rdquo;  They marvelled
because this was not something that you see everyday.  </p>

<p>Have you ever seen a storm at sea and someone quiet the
storm through their own power?  We have never seen this.  What if you did see
this like the disciples saw this?  How would you react?  What would you be
thinking?  You would be thinking something like, &ldquo;Did I just see this?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This helps us to understand a little bit of why they
marvelled.  They marvelled at this because it was something extraordinary. 
This was something that they had never seen before.  This was something that
actually no man could possibly do, and yet here was Jesus the Messiah who
quieted the storm.  It became a peaceful sea, and so they marvelled.  </p>

<p>Go also to Matthew 9 where we will begin in verse 6.  We
read in Matthew 9:6-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed,
and go unto thine house. And he arose, and departed to his house. But when the
multitude saw <i>it, </i>they <span class="underline">marvelled</span>, and glorified God, which had
given such power unto men.  </p>

<p>The palsy man rose up after his affliction was healed. 
There were witnesses to this, and they marvelled.  Do you see how God is
beginning to define this word?  </p>

<p>Turn next to Mark 5.  We read in Mark 5:15-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and
they were afraid. And they that saw <i>it </i>told them how it befell to him
that was possessed with the devil, and <i>also </i>concerning the swine. And
they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. And when he was come into
the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be
with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends,
and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had
compassion on thee. And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how
great things Jesus had done for him: and all <i>men </i>did <span class="underline">marvel</span>.  </p>

<p>This man would have told them, &ldquo;I used to be a crazy man.  I
was a lunatic.  I had Legion.  Devils possessed me and I would run around naked
and cutting myself with stones.  Then along came a man named Jesus who healed
me and put me back in my right mind.  All of a sudden, everything was fine.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what he would have told his family in Decapolis. 
This is what he would have told his friends.  He would have told this to anyone
who would have listened, and they heard and they marvelled at his story.  They
were really amazed that this was so, and so God is explaining what He means by
the word &ldquo;marvel.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We also read in Luke 2:28-33:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord,
now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine
eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared before the face of all
people; A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. And
Joseph and his mother <span class="underline">marvelled</span> at those things which were spoken of
him.  </p>

<p>This was the baby Jesus, the child Jesus.  He was taken into
the temple where Simeon saw Him.  Then Simeon basically proclaimed, &ldquo;This is
the Saviour.&rdquo;  Joseph and Mary had already had some unusual occurrences happen
with the child because she was a virgin when she gave birth.  God had said, &ldquo;For
that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;  How incredible!  How
amazing!  </p>

<p>So we get a little glimpse into Joseph and Mary&rsquo;s pondering
of that little baby who was entrusted to their care for a few years and
wondering about this child.  If you remember, it says, &ldquo;Mary kept all these
things, and pondered <i>them </i>in her heart.&rdquo;  They were just standing in awe
and amazement at the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>We also read in Matthew 15:30-31:  </p>

<p class="verse">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i>those
that were </i>lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus&rsquo; feet; and he healed them: Insomuch that the multitude <span class="underline">wondered</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;wondered&rdquo; is the same Greek word that was
translated as &ldquo;marvelled.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the
maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified
the God of Israel.  </p>

<p>People were seeing things that were supernatural, things
that were not only unusual but impossible.  These were impossible things,
things that ordinarily would never happen.  </p>

<p>As we live presently in our day, we have never seen a lame
man walk who was suddenly healed, despite what some people try to show on TV
where they really pull the wool over people&rsquo;s eyes.  We have never seen anyone
who was truly lame walk or someone have a withered hand restored whole or
someone who was blind since birth given sight or the deaf to hear, the dumb to
speak, or the dead raised to life.  We have not seen any of this, and yet it
was almost common place during the Lord&rsquo;s ministry that He could be seen doing
these things.  People all over were witnesses, and so they began to marvel. 
They were in awe of this.  </p>

<p>Another verse is Luke 24:12, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, <span class="underline">wondering</span>
in himself at that which was come to pass.  </p>

<p>This is the same word.  They were marveling at the empty
tomb and that Christ had risen, that He was not there, that He was not still
there.  All sorts of thoughts were going through Peter&rsquo;s mind as he marvelled
at this situation.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 41 of the same chapter, Luke 24:41:  </p>

<p class="verse">And while they yet believed not for joy, and <span class="underline">wondered</span>, he
said unto them, Have ye here any meat?  </p>

<p>This was when He showed Himself in proving His
resurrection.  Again, they were marveling.  </p>

<p>The whole Gospel is a marvel.  It really is.  The Bible is
something to marvel at.  What we read in the Scriptures is a marvelous thing. 
It is incredible.  All that God tells us of the power that He reveals and of
the mysteries that He makes plain, all of these things are truly marvelous.  </p>

<p>We also read in Acts 7:30-31:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. When
Moses saw <i>it, </i>he <span class="underline">wondered</span> at the sight&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, this was a supernatural site.  Man, finite and
temporal man, as he looks at it and does not understand how it can be, he
wonders, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;  So Moses turned aside and then God began to speak to
him from the burning bush.  </p>

<p>These are Scriptures that show us how people wonder or stand
amazed or marvel at what God has done.  So in John 5, Christ is speaking about
the resurrection of the dead and He says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Marvel</span> not at this&hellip;  </p>

<p>He says, &ldquo;Do not marvel at this,&rdquo; and we wonder, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; 
We are not to marvel at this because God has proven Himself and has
demonstrated His power repeatedly again and again and again.  </p>

<p>So is it a difficult thing for Him to raise the dead?  Is it
impossible for God to raise the dead?  Is it impossible for Him to bring forth
the resurrection of the dead?  </p>

<p>No.  Do not marvel at this.  He has shown and demonstrated
the great power that He possesses, and so this is not something that we are to
marvel at.  </p>

<p>There is another verse that tells us not to marvel.  We read
in 1 John 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Marvel</span> not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  </p>

<p>Do not marvel at this.  This is not surprising because Jesus
said, &ldquo;In the world ye shall have tribulation.&rdquo;  He told us that we would
experience affliction.  He has told us in so many places what to expect when we
live the Christian life, and so He says, &ldquo;Marvel not at this.&rdquo;  This is not
something to be surprised at or something that should shock us.  This is the
normative experience for the child of God in this world.  </p>

<p>Likewise, do not marvel at the resurrection of the dead.  &ldquo;Marvel
not,&rdquo; because He intends to do this.  He has shown that He is very capable of
doing this: to speak and for the dead to rise.  Did He not speak when He
created the world?  When this world came into being and the whole universe that
stretched out into the heavens that no one has ever found the end of, did He
not do this just simply by speaking?  By God commanding it so to be, it
happened.  </p>

<p>Going back to John 5:28, we read again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves shall hear his voice,  </p>

<p>They are going to hear His voice.  </p>

<p>Dead people are in the graves and Christ has shown that He
can speak to the dead and that they will respond to Him, as we read in Luke
8:54-55:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
saying, Maid, arise. And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and
he commanded to give her meat.  </p>

<p>Christ spoke to the young girl who was dead and she obeyed. 
She heard Him.  She did rise up.  </p>

<p>How?  We do not know how; we just know that Christ has this
power.  He gave her life and ears to hear so that she could respond.  </p>

<p>Also, go to Luke 7 where we read of a situation with a widow
woman of a city called Nain.  She only had one son and he had died.  Then we
read in Luke 7:12-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was
a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and
much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had
compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the
bier: and they that bare <i>him </i>stood still. And he said, Young man, I say
unto thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
delivered him to his mother.  </p>

<p>This is about the dead hearing the voice of Christ and
coming back to life.  </p>

<p>Of course, we are all familiar with Lazarus in John 11. 
Lazarus had been dead for four days.  There was no question that he had been
dead.  We read in John 11:41-44:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then they took away the stone <i>from the place </i>where the
dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <i>his </i>eyes, and said, Father, I thank
thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but
because of the people which stand by I said <i>it, </i>that they may believe
that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud
voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and
foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith
unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  </p>

<p>This was another demonstration of the mighty power of God to
simply speak and have the dead rise.  He did not have to say this in a loud
voice.  He did not even have to say this out loud; but for our benefit, He
did.  Christ said, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo;  The man had been dead for four days
and, just like that, he rose up and came forth in obedience to the command of
the Lord Jesus Christ.  He was still bound in grave clothes and still dressed
like a dead man.  He looked like a dead man, as far as how he had been prepared
for his burial; except now, he was walking.  He was now showing signs of life,
so the disciples would have removed the grave clothes and he would have gone
about his business in the world once again.  </p>

<p>If you remember, there was a dinner that we read about in
John 12.  The Passover was in Bethany, and we read in John 12:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him.  </p>

<p>He was just getting ready for the meal, like anyone else. 
He had been dead, and now he was alive.  The Jewish people not only wanted to
come to see Christ, but they also wanted to see the dead man.  They wanted to
see this dead man who could sit at a table and eat like a living person,
because now he was living; he was alive.  </p>

<p>Of course, Lazarus would have died later.  We do not know
when or how.  The chief priests had been thinking about putting him to death. 
They wanted to kill him, and so he would have died a second time; but people
were believing on Jesus because of Lazarus.  They realized that he had been a
stinking dead corpse that had been in a tomb for four days, and that he was now
walking amongst them just like anyone else.  </p>

<p>Do you marvel at this?  This is marvelous!  This is a
wonderful thing!  </p>

<p>Certainly, the Lord Jesus Christ has shown repeatedly that
He possesses the power and the might and the ability to raise the dead.  It
does not hurt Him.  It is not like a heavy lift; He just has to say the Word. 
All He has to do is to speak.  &ldquo;The voice of the LORD <i>is </i>powerful,&rdquo; it
says in the Psalms.  It also says, &ldquo;The voice of the LORD <i>is </i>full of
majesty.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God said, &ldquo;Let there be light: and there was light.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Let
there be&rdquo; animals, and there were animals.  &ldquo;Let there be&rdquo; man created &ldquo;in our
image,&rdquo; and man was created in His image.  </p>

<p>Now at the end of time, at the end of all things, it will be
God speaking to melt the world and all of the unsaved thereon.  The whole
universe will melt with a fervent heat, and all He has to do is say the Word.  </p>

<p>He has long-sufferingly and patiently refrained from
speaking this Word in order to accomplish His purpose of saving His elect and
precisely following His timeline to the appointed day of judgment.  We now know
when this appointed day will be.  It will be May 21 of 2011.  </p>

<p>Then He will speak, as He says in John 5.  He is going to
speak to the dead, to all of the dead.  He will speak to His elect people who
have died and were buried, and to the unsaved who also died and were buried, as
it says in John 5:28-29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that
have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil,
unto the resurrection of damnation.  </p>

<p>The resurrection is something that man tends to not
believe.  Mankind tends not to believe the resurrection.  </p>

<p>In Acts 17 when the Apostle Paul was in Athens, he preached
the resurrection.  It says in Acts 17:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He
seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them
Jesus, and the resurrection.  </p>

<p>Also in verse 32, Acts 17:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this <i>matter.</i>  </p>

<p>This is something that man does not believe.  Natural man
just does not understand or think that this is possible.  He thinks that anyone
who says something along these lines is like a babbler.  He believes that you
are someone who does not understand the world and how the world works and how
the world operates.  &ldquo;Look, this is it.  You get to live your life.  Live it to
the best of your ability because then you are going to die.  Period.&rdquo;  This is
really the underlying message of the world itself, but this is all false.  This
is wrong.  This is not how it is.  </p>

<p>For more proof that this is the world&rsquo;s understanding, we
read in Acts 26:23-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">That Christ should suffer, <i>and </i>that he should be the
first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people,
and to the Gentiles. And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. But he
said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and
soberness.  </p>

<p>Paul was discussing the resurrection of the dead.  This is
when Festus broke in, &ldquo;You are crazy!  You are a mad man!&rdquo;  Paul, of course,
correctly responded, &ldquo;No.  No, I am not mad.  This is very sober-mindedness. 
This is not insanity; this is understanding what God has said in His Word.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>He has shown this to be true.  He has proved this.  All
through the Bible, He has proved that His words are true and faithful and
trustworthy and that we can rely on them.  Actually, we should trust only in
them, &ldquo;Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding.&rdquo;  Do not try to think that your reasoning and that your
understanding of the world is better than God&rsquo;s understanding who created the
world.  We are just a creature and He is the Creator; therefore, we are to
believe what God has said in His Word, in the Bible.   </p>

<p>Going back to John 5, it says in John 5:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
resurrection of life&hellip;  </p>

<p>Does this mean that God is going to raise all of the good
people?  God is going to raise up all of the good people.  There is only one
problem with this.  What is the problem?  The problem is, &ldquo;There is none that
doeth good, no, not one.&rdquo;  We read about this in several places in Romans 3.  &ldquo;There
is none righteous&hellip;there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
after God&hellip;there is none that doeth good.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why is it the resurrection of those who &ldquo;have done good&rdquo;? 
This is because when God saves an individual, He gives them His Spirit and He
prepares for them good works to walk in.  He arranges this.  He moves within
them to will and do of His good pleasure.  So they will do things that are
pleasing to Him in their lives after their salvation.  Salvation has nothing to
do with their good works or their good deeds of any kind.  It has to do with
what God has worked in them.  </p>

<p>This is what is being said here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they that have done good&hellip;  </p>

<p>Anyone who is saved has &ldquo;done good&rdquo; because God has made
sure that they did good.  They were saved through the work and the faith of the
Lord Jesus and not their own.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life&hellip;  </p>

<p>We do not really have any problem with this.  We are still
correctly understanding that there will be a resurrection of life.  God is
going to speak and bring forth His people out of the graves, and they will live
right then and forevermore.  Their spirits have been in Heaven with Him and now
He is giving them a new resurrected body.  Their body and soul, which now have
both been resurrected, will be brought together again.  This will be the
spiritual body that God has given them into eternity future and they are going
to live.  </p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 4 describes this beginning in verse 15.  We
read in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
are alive <i>and </i>remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent [<i>precede</i>]
them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead
in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive <i>and </i>remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the great day, next May 21, 2011, the day of God&rsquo;s
wrath, but also the day of the resurrection, the day of the rapture, all of the
things that God has spoken about in His Word.  This will be the completeness of
His salvation plan for His elect people.  He will gather them and bring them to
Himself, like &ldquo;the precious fruit of the earth.&rdquo;  He is the harvestman.  He is
the husbandman who collects His fruit and brings it in.  This is why He speaks
of the Feast of Ingathering in relationship to the end of the world.  </p>

<p>Going back to John 5, let us look at the more difficult
thing.  We read in John 5:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.  </p>

<p>Doing evil is easy to understand because this is what man
does naturally.  We do evil.  We have sinned.  We have broken His Law.  We have
transgressed the commandments.  </p>

<p>These individuals did not become saved.  God did not pay for
their sins in any way.  Therefore, they died in their sin.  Now they are being
resurrected &ldquo;unto the resurrection of damnation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How are the unsaved dead going to rise?  Are they going to
come back to life, like the ones who were risen to life, God&rsquo;s elect people?  Are
the unsaved dead going to be returned to conscious existence and once again
stand upon the earth in order to stand before God for judgment?  </p>

<p>This does not sound right at all, does it?  When the unsaved
dead died, they died wicked and rebellious.  What does the Bible say about man in
Genesis 6?  It says that &ldquo;the thoughts of his heart <i>was </i>only evil
continually.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So at some point in their life, they finally died.  Where
did they go?  Some people who think that man will be brought back to life with
a whole personality and with their thoughts intact will have to answer this. 
However, the Bible is very clear when it states that on the day that man dies, &ldquo;in
that very day his thoughts perish&rdquo;; they cease to be.  </p>

<p>However, people who think that God will reconstitute the
person and bring them back to being the same old sinner that they used to be
will have to answer, for example, where did someone&rsquo;s spirit go who died in
1100 A.D.?  We know that the body went into the ground, but where did that mind
and those thoughts go?  They did not go to Heaven to be with the Lord because
only the spirit of God&rsquo;s people at the point of death goes to be with the
Lord.  </p>

<p>Where did the unsaved man&rsquo;s thoughts go?  People might say
that they are in a state of soul-sleep where they are not aware of anything and
that the next thing they will know is that they are standing before God for
judgment.  </p>

<p>People who believe this are saying that God is going to put
back all of the evil into that person, all of the wicked thoughts: the
adulterous thoughts, the murderous thoughts, the lying thoughts, and the
hateful thoughts.  They are saying that He is going to put them all back
together in order that man can continue to think wickedly and to think evilly,
because the thoughts in his heart while he lived were &ldquo;only evil continually&rdquo;
in God&rsquo;s sight.  </p>

<p>So people believe that God is going to put all of that evil
back into that man and then judge him and throw him into a place that God will
create that is supposedly called &ldquo;hell,&rdquo; according to what they are saying. 
Then into eternity future, this individual will be able to shake his fist at
God and rebel against Him with fresh, new sin.  He did not overtly and so
obviously sin this way while he was living, but now he is sinning far worse. 
He is now blaspheming God and cursing God because of the pain and because of
the torment of being under God&rsquo;s wrath eternally, eternally, eternally, without
end.  </p>

<p>Would this even be smart?  Would there be any wisdom in
doing this?  Would God bring him back in order that the man could continue to
blaspheme Him?  We could say, &ldquo;Yes, because he is being punished.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, have you ever seen a murderer when he is thrown into
prison because he did something very awful, and yet he kind of flaunts it to
the family of the individual whom he killed?  </p>

<p>What does this family want?  Do they want him to continue to
live on death row, to continue to suffer so that whenever he gets an
opportunity he can say something that is very disrespectful about the one he
killed or to the family of the one he killed?  Or do they want him put to
death, which ends it?  </p>

<p>Death gives closure.  They can now turn their minds away
from that grizzly thing.  How awful it would be if a man could continue to do
and say things, as he would continue to exist in pain for his crime.  </p>

<p>Likewise, God has no intention of raising the dead and
giving them conscious thoughts again in order that they can continually rebel
into eternity against Him.  This is not possible and nothing in this would
glorify God in any way.  </p>

<p>Rather, in the day he dies, &ldquo;his thoughts perish&rdquo;; they are
gone.  He ceases to be in his personality.  He does not know anymore about the
good or the bad or anything else, and he never will again.  He is not coming
back to life, as God says in Job 20:5-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is </i>short, and the joy
of the hypocrite <i>but </i>for a moment? Though his excellency mount up to the
heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;<i> Yet </i>he shall perish for
ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where <i>is </i>he?
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased
away as a vision of the night.  </p>

<p>Poof!  All gone!  All gone, except for the body, which is in
the ground somewhere and in some form.  It might be ashes or it might be dust. 
Maybe it is just a few old bones, or maybe someone recently died and they still
have some flesh that is corrupting on their body.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s plan is to raise up the dead, not to life, to
conscious existence, but to raise them.  The resurrection, the word itself,
which is <i>anastasis </i>[<i>note: speaker inadvertently said &ldquo;</i><i>krisis&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;</i><i>anastasis&rdquo;</i>], means &ldquo;to rise.&rdquo;  It is translated this way
two times.  It means &ldquo;to come up.&rdquo;  It does not get into how or in what
manner.  The word itself does not try to describe what it is to rise, only that
it is arising.  </p>

<p>So God will raise the dead supernaturally, just as He will
raise His people to life.  He will raise the dead up out of the ground and then
leave them upon the face of the earth and scattered all over the place as He
will use earthquakes to open the ground and to bring this all to pass.  This
will happen on May 21 of next year.  </p>

<p>There are some words that we just assume as soon as we hear
them that we know what they mean because we have been indoctrinated or taught
the meaning of certain words.  One of these words is &ldquo;damnation.&rdquo;  We know what
this means, to be damned.  </p>

<p>Again, we read in John 5:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Damnation&rdquo; means &ldquo;hell.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Damnation&rdquo; means &ldquo;eternal
damnation,&rdquo; and it is translated this way.  </p>

<p>In Mark 3, in reference to the sin of blaspheming the Holy
Spirit, this word is used along with the word &ldquo;eternal.&rdquo;  We read in Mark
3:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:  </p>

<p>We had thought that God was definitely referring to &ldquo;hell,&rdquo;
a place that He would create.  This is what I thought before God opened the
Bible and corrected us.  He has shown us that there is no eternal hell, but
there is a judgment.  There is a Judgment Day and there is payment that must be
made for sin.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;damnation&rdquo; is found 48 times in the New Testament. 
Actually, this is the word <i>krisis</i>.  When I said that this was another
word, that was incorrect.  The word &ldquo;damnation&rdquo; is the word <i>krisis</i> and
this is used 48 times in the New Testament.  It is used three times as &ldquo;damnation,&rdquo;

twice as &ldquo;condemnation,&rdquo; twice as &ldquo;accusation,&rdquo; and 41 times as &ldquo;judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This word is used of God to indicate that He will bring
about the judgment of man, which is what Jesus is saying in this passage.  He
will raise His people to life and them who have done evil unto the resurrection
of judgment.  This is speaking of judgment and it is referring to Judgment Day;
and because &ldquo;damnation&rdquo; is a word that has such connotations, do not even think
about this word.  It is the resurrection of judgment.  It is God&rsquo;s time that He
has designed in which He will judge man.  </p>

<p>What is the nature of this judgment?  It is five months of
torment, from May 21 through October 21.  </p>

<p>Let us go to a couple of other verses before we close.  We
read in Jeremiah 8:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">At that time, saith JEHOVAH, they shall bring out the bones of
the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests,
and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
out of their graves: And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon,
and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served,
and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have
worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung
upon the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>It says in Matthew 24, &ldquo;He shall send his angels&hellip;and they
shall gather together his elect.&rdquo;  The fruit is gathered in.  It is the Feast
of Ingathering.  </p>

<p>By the way, if you carefully read the information concerning
the Feast of Ingathering, the fruit is gathered before the Feast.  Some people
try to say that we have to wait until October 21 until the last day of the
Feast; but no.  Read the verses again.  The fruit is gathered before the Feast
is held.  </p>

<p>So on May 21, God will gather in His elect people, &ldquo;the
precious fruit of the earth,&rdquo; and He will leave behind all else.  This is what
is in view here in Jeremiah 8:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>In Jeremiah 9:22, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Speak, Thus saith JEHOVAH, Even the carcases of men shall fall
as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none
shall gather <i>them.</i>  </p>

<p>This is a leaving.  This is the fruit that is a stench. 
This is the fruit that is rotten, like the rotten figs and the good figs.  The
good figs went into captivity.  The evil figs stayed in Judah.  They were the
rotten fruit, but you do not gather rotten fruit when you conduct your
harvest.  As you are going down the field, you gather the good fruit and you
throw away the bad, as God indicates with the fish in a parable in Matthew 13
where they &ldquo;gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.&rdquo;  This is
what He intends to do on May 21.  </p>

<p>In Jeremiah 25, God speaks of His judgment on Jerusalem
first and then on all of the nations of the world.  We read in Jeremiah
25:28-33:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; Ye shall
certainly drink. For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by
my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I
will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith JEHOVAH of
hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them,
JEHOVAH shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation;
he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that
tread <i>the grapes, </i>against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise
shall come <i>even </i>to the ends of the earth; for JEHOVAH hath a controversy
with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them <i>that are </i>wicked
to the sword, saith JEHOVAH. Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts, Behold, evil shall go
forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the
coasts of the earth. And the slain of JEHOVAH shall be at that day from <i>one </i>end
of the earth even unto the <i>other </i>end of the earth: they shall not be
lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.  </p>

<p>God is very clear.  He is very clear with what He intends to
do next year.  This is the incredible thing.  It has finally come.  The time of
the end of the world has finally arrived.  </p>

<p>God also says in Isaiah 26:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
indignation be overpast. For, behold, JEHOVAH cometh out of his place to punish
the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose
her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.  </p>

<p>Man has been put into the ground.  Man has sinned and died
for thousands of years.  For thousands of years, the earth, in a sense, has
covered the slain.  In a way, it has covered up all of the sins and the
iniquities of man.  God is going to open up the ground and reveal this.  He
will bring up the dead and they will be littered across the face of the earth. 
This is the resurrection of the just to life, and the resurrection of the
unjust to damnation, to judgment, to experience the wrath of God and the five
months of torment.     </p>

<p>Let us close here.  </p>
