<p>Turn to Matthew 13. In Matthew 13, we are going to look at a
passage that is familiar. And one of the reasons why I wanted to go here was, I
listened to the debate between Mr. Camping and Dr. White recently.  I prefer to
call it a discussion, because I know that is the mindset of a believer, because
the Bible tells us not to get into debates, and I am sure Mr. Camping,
actually, definitely sure, because I heard he was not debating, he was just
discussing the Scripture, and yet, others do look at it as a debate.  </p>

<p>Well, the main theme of the whole debate was Biblical
hermeneutics, or how do we understand the Bible, what is the proper way, the
correct way of interpreting the Bible? And Dr. White did not agree with
information that we find here in Matthew 13, that Christ spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables,</b>&rdquo;
and without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did not speak.  </p>

<p>He brought up some ideas, and actually to some degree, they
were facts that there are places in the Bible where Jesus does not speak in &ldquo;<b>parables.</b>&rdquo;
And there are definitely places in the Bible as a whole, the Word of God, as
Christ is the Word, where it is not a parabolic statement.  And so, that got me
thinking, about how we understand this. Let me read from Matthew 13, and we
will think about it a little bit more.  In Matthew 13, Jesus has already given
a &ldquo;<b>parable,</b>&rdquo; and then in verses 10-12 it says:</p>

<p class="verse">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto
you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he
hath.  </p>

<p>By the way, that explains a lot, why there are some people
that seem to be following along on the same path, they seem to be understanding
the Bible pretty much evenly, but if an individual is not truly saved, not &ldquo;<b>born
again,</b>&rdquo; if they do not have the Spirit of Christ within them, there is
going to be a separation at some point, because they are going to hear things
that they are not going to understand.  That is just how it is, that is how God
wrote the Bible, and actually you know a good way of looking at that, because
some people get disturbed, &ldquo;Wow, he does not understand this.  In the last
ten-fifteen years I thought I was having fellowship with that person, or those
people, and now all of a sudden they have gone way off there.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, a good way of looking at this is like two trains on a
track, two trains on a track at the station, everyone gets on one train, and
some others get on another train, and they are going the same direction, and so
they are parallel. You look out the window, and there are your buddies, there
are your friends all going the same direction, but the problem is originally
they got on a different train, on a different track, and two trains can go the
same direction for awhile. But at some point the tracks are going to bend, and
the tracks are going to turn and there goes your friend.  </p>

<p>See that is the key, that when God is opening up the
understanding of His people they will &ldquo;<b>endure to the end</b>,&rdquo; they will
endure &ldquo;<b>sound doctrine</b>,&rdquo; they will go all the way to the end in the
doctrine of Christ. But no matter how hard someone might try to understand and
to see things from the Bible, at some point, if they are not saved, there is
going to be that separation, and they are going to go off in a different way. 
That is what Jesus is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that
he hath.  </p>

<p>As some people did not agree with the &ldquo;<b>five months,</b>&rdquo;
or did not understand the nature of judgment, that it is annihilation, and not
eternal hell, and yet previously they seem to have all kinds of understanding. 
But I have run into people and discussed things with people, now they are
checking all these other things. Is  there a Biblical calendar? Does God give
us that?  They are going off, whatever truths they did know for a period of
time they are losing, some are even looking at the church as a possibility
again.  Of course you can see why, they are all alone.  They came out of the
church, they left the church and then for awhile they were following along in
agreement with the doctrines that we are learning and they were listening to
faithful teaching from Family Radio, but then annihilation really hit them in their
pride, or not understanding that the nature of Christ&rsquo;s death, that is another
one that is very hard to take, very humbling. And so they find themselves not
in agreement with the church, and not in agreement with teachings they are
hearing, and it is very isolating, and so naturally they are looking again. 
They are really fooling themselves, they are telling themselves, &ldquo;With an open
mind I am going to look at these things again,&rdquo; but really, they just want some
company, they just want some company.  They feel very isolated and very alone. 
</p>

<p>Well, the true believer of course is never alone because we
have God with us, and He is all the child of God needs. But if someone is not a
true believer and they get into that trouble.  Verses 13-16 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. And in them is
fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias [<i>or Isaiah</i>], which saith, By hearing ye
shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not
perceive: For this people&rsquo;s heart is waxed gross, and <i>their </i>ears are
dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should
see with <i>their </i>eyes and hear with <i>their </i>ears, and should
understand with <i>their </i>heart, and should be converted, and I should heal
them. But blessed <i>are </i>your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
hear.  </p>

<p>And Jesus is speaking to all people here, especially those
in the churches and congregations; they are &ldquo;<b>hearing</b>&rdquo; but &ldquo;<b>they hear
not</b>.&rdquo;  They have the Bible week after week, but they do not hear it. They &ldquo;<b>see</b>&rdquo;

the Scriptures, but they &ldquo;<b>see not</b>,&rdquo; not spiritually, they are not
understanding properly what the Bible teaches.  </p>

<p>Well, in this passage that we just read, we can learn that God
did not give us &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; to make the Bible easier to understand, or
that Jesus did not speak in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; in order to make the Bible easier
to understand, or to make His point easier to comprehend.  He is saying, no I
speak this way because, seeing they will not see, and hearing they will not
hear. So He gives these &ldquo;<b>parables,</b>&rdquo; and all kinds of people do not get
it, they do not understand what He is saying.  And that is the very purpose
that God spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>.&rdquo;  The Bible is not an easy book to understand,
it is very complex, it is very difficult, and especially &ldquo;<b>parables</b>.&rdquo;  I
can think of one or two &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; that we really do not know today
after nearly two thousand years that Jesus gave the &ldquo;<b>parable,</b>&rdquo; we still
do not have a very good or complete understanding of the &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;

because God is using that method of speech, parabolic language, to hide truth. 
That is the nature of &ldquo;<b>parables</b>.&rdquo;  That is why it is so important.</p>

<p>A little further on in Matthew 13:33:  </p>

<p class="verse">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till
the whole was leavened.  </p>

<p>So there is a short one sentence &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; that
Christ has given, and it is teaching a truth, it is teaching a truth. And then
in verse 34:  </p>

<p class="verse">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable spake he not unto them:  </p>

<p>Now Jesus is the Word, &ldquo;<b>(in the volume of the book it is
written of me)</b>,&rdquo; we find in Hebrews.  Yet in His own ministry while He was
on earth, when He was sharing the Gospel He spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; in order
to hide truth and to teach His people, especially but to teach His people, this
is the nature of the Bible, this is the character of the Bible.  And that is
why Jesus being the Word spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; and it says, without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;

he did not speak.  </p>

<p>Now the question is, how can we understand that? Because we
go to this verse in order to tell someone, see that is how you have to
understand the whole Bible.  You have to understand the whole Bible is a &ldquo;<b>parable,</b>&rdquo;
and then they can go Romans 5:1, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ:  </p>

<p>Now, that is just an example verse, there are many like it.
Is that verse a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;?  If you said to someone that Christ is the
Word, and He spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; and without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did
not speak, and you are really saying the whole Bible was written in this way,
and someone goes here and they say, we are &ldquo;<b>justified by faith.</b>&rdquo; Where is
the parabolic statement in that?  There are many verses like that, so really
what we say is well, Christ spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables,</b>&rdquo; but every now and then
God makes plain Gospel statements, He makes plain statements regarding the
Gospel like, &ldquo;<b>being justified by faith,</b>&rdquo; that is what we tell people.
But is that being accurate, or saying without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did not
speak, and He is the whole Bible, the whole Word of God, is it being accurate? 
Well, actually we are saying most of the Bible is in parabolic form, either
actual statement, like Jesus would say, &ldquo;<b>the Kingdom of heaven is like,</b>&rdquo;

or historical &ldquo;<b>parables</b>,&rdquo; or a book of &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; like Proverbs.
But we say, there are cases where God speaks directly, and gives a Gospel
statement.  So we are kind of saying, yes, it is true, the whole Bible. Bu<span class="underline">t</span>
and actually what Jesus said, without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did not speak, is
true of the whole Bible from Genesis through Revelation. It is true, that
everything is a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo;  But we have to understand what He meant by a

&ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us look at some of the verses in the Bible. Look at
Matthew 16. This is a verse that, we as true believers would point to in order
to help someone understand the nature of the Bible.  It says in verses 6-12:</p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
<i>It is </i>because we have taken no bread.<i> Which </i>when Jesus perceived,
he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because
ye have brought no bread? Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five
loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven
loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? How is it that ye
do not understand that I spake <i>it </i>not to you concerning bread, that ye
should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? Then
understood they how that he bade <i>them </i>not beware of the leaven of bread,
but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  </p>

<p>See, they heard a statement, and they took it literally, and
that is another hermeneutic, a Biblical hermeneutic, some people use with the
Bible.  They say, &ldquo;Well you have to understand the Bible literally, and if God
said something, well that is what He meant, it is a plain statement, understand
it exactly as He said it.&rdquo;  Well, the Disciples did that, He was talking about
bread, and so they naturally thought of bread and they were wrong, they were
wrong.  No, He was using bread as an example of doctrine, of the teaching of
the Sadducees, the teaching of the Pharisees.  He was using that in order to be
a type of what He really meant.  In other words, He was hiding truth.  </p>

<p>Also, go to John 6, this passage it really describes a lot
of how we are to understand the Bible.  In John 6:51-55, Jesus is talking to
people that were listening to Him.  They were following Him to some degree and
it says in John 6:51-55:  </p>

<p class="verse">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my
flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews therefore strove
among themselves, saying, How can this man give us <i>his </i>flesh to eat?
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso
eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him
up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 
</p>

<p>Now, many Protestant churches would condemn the Catholic
church for saying this very thing, this is the blood of Christ, this is the
body of Christ, as they are giving the bread and the wine, or the grape juice
in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. And we know that God is finished with the churches, and
that is not in view anymore, it does not matter what churches are doing,
because they do not have the authority or the blessing of God anymore. But we
can see that, that is being a little bit more honest with what this is saying,
as far as the literal understanding of the Bible.  Jesus said, you must eat my
flesh and drink my blood.  And of course the Jews did not understand.  It says
in verse 60:  </p>

<p class="verse">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <i>this, </i>said,
This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Who can hear it?</b>&rdquo;  It is so difficult, and that is
the nature of the Bible&mdash;covering truth,
hiding truth.  </p>

<p>If you go to Luke 17, and this is an example I like to use
when people say we are to use the historical grammatical method of interpreting
Scripture, literal method, the plain understanding method.  Well, in Luke 17,
it speaks of ten lepers.  In verses 12-14:</p>

<p class="verse">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
that were lepers, which stood afar off: And they lifted up <i>their </i>voices,
and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And when he saw <i>them, </i>he said
unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. &hellip;  </p>

<p>Now, Jesus said that, because, back in Leviticus 14, in the
first couple of verses, especially verse 2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing:
He shall be brought unto the priest:  </p>

<p>And the priest will make a sacrifice.  Jesus was going to
cleanse the lepers, they did become cleansed of their leprosy. So, He is
referring to Leviticus 14, and He tells them in Luke 17:14-18: </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass,
that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he
was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, And fell down on <i>his
</i>face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus
answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where <i>are </i>the nine?
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.  </p>

<p>Let me ask the children, where are the nine lepers? Where
did they go?  To the priest, they went to the priest, that is what Jesus told
them to do, &ldquo;<b>Go show yourselves unto the priests,</b>&rdquo; maybe they were even
familiar with Leviticus 14, they were Jews, well the nine were, the one was a
Samaritan.  They would have been familiar with some parts of the Bible
possibly, and Jesus tells them plainly, straightforward, literally, &ldquo;<b>Go show
yourselves unto the priests,</b>&rdquo; and as they went, all ten were cleansed, and
their skin became like a baby, probably just like Naaman the Syrian who was
cleansed of his leprosy.  </p>

<p>And one of the lepers, the Samaritan, he realizes that this
awful disease which could cause your digits, your fingers to fall off, or your
nose to be destroyed, this awful disease, this leprosy was removed from him,
and he turns around and runs to Jesus and falls down and gives Him honour and
glorifies God Christ tells us. And what else did he do?  He disobeyed.  Jesus
said, &ldquo;<b>Go show yourselves unto the priests,</b>&rdquo; and just this one man after
seeing that he was cleansed, runs back to Jesus.  He did not go with the nine
to Jerusalem, he went to Jesus.  Now that we know that Christ spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo;
and without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did not speak, we know the whole Bible is a
spiritual book and is hiding truth.  What is the truth of Leviticus 14:2? What
is the truth that is hid that a &ldquo;<b>leper in the day of his cleansing</b>&rdquo;

should show himself to the priest?  Leprosy represents sin, the priest
represents Christ, the &ldquo;<b>great high priest</b>&rdquo; for His people.  So Jesus
when He saves someone, He cleanses them spiritually of the awful disease of
sin. And a saved person on &ldquo;<b>the day of his cleansing,&rdquo;</b> at the moment of
salvation, goes to Jesus, right?  And we fall down because now He becomes our
Lord, our God, our Master, we serve Him, we give Him glory.  And the Samaritan
acted out exactly what Leviticus 14 was teaching for centuries, that a sinner
on the day of salvation is to go to Jesus.  And the Samaritan ran and Jesus
commends him, &ldquo;<b>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
this stranger</b>.&rdquo;  Meaning, the other nine did not give glory to God.  How
can they fail of not giving glory to God when they listen to Him, they obeyed
Him, they went to Jerusalem and found an earthly priest.  Well yes, but they
missed &ldquo;<b>For Christ <i>is</i> the end of the law</b>,&rdquo; they missed what the
Bible was teaching and hiding in that statement that Jesus reiterated to them
that they should show themselves to a priest.  </p>

<p>Now this is very serious, this is very serious, because this
is telling us, people who want to take the Bible completely literally are not
giving glory to God, and it is an indicator they are not saved.  They do not
understand, &ldquo;<b>they seeing see not</b>; and hearing they hear not.&rdquo;  They do
not understand the Bible itself, and they do not understand how God gave us the
Bible, how He spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You know, as we think about the Bible, just look at the
various books. Proverbs, Proverbs is a book of &ldquo;<b>parables</b>,&rdquo; it is a whole
book.  That is what a proverb is, it is a story that has a spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>Or think about Job, go to Job 27:1: </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,  </p>

<p>Now Job is a historical book, and he was a historical
character, he was a real man, and everything we read in the book of Job was
true and an historical fact, but God also is using it as a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Job 29:1:</p>

<p class="verse">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,  </p>

<p>Now, that helps us understand Job, a type of Christ who is
suffering. And in Job&rsquo;s suffering we see Jesus suffering for the sins of His
people.  As we look at the Bible we find books like Daniel, Ezekiel that give
us images and kind of strange accounts. Like, if you read Ezekiel 1, the &ldquo;<b>four
living creatures</b>,&rdquo; what is that?  Or the book of Revelation, which speaks
of &ldquo;<b>a beast</b>&rdquo; coming &ldquo;<b>up out of the sea,</b>&rdquo; and the harlot Babylon,
and all these images.  </p>

<p>How can anyone avoid the truth that God is speaking in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo;? 
Well, they avoid it by saying Revelation is a book of hyperbolic language, that
is a theological term.  What does hyperbolic mean?  Exaggeration, to make a
point, &ldquo;<b>parables</b>.&rdquo;  They say it is hyperbolic, because they do not want
to use the word &ldquo;<b>parable</b>,&rdquo; they may have to learn that Jesus spoke with &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo;

and without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; He did not speak.  </p>

<p>Or the Song of Solomon is poetic, this is what the
theologians call that book. But if you read the Song of Solomon, there are
images of &ldquo;<b>my sister <i>my</i> spouse</b>&rdquo; and the love of the Shulamite
woman, but it is a picture of Christ and His church.  </p>

<p>It is only when we understand that God spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables,</b>&rdquo;

that we understand Esther.  How can you understand the book of Esther that does
not even make reference to God, unless you know that King Ahasuerus is a type
of God, and when he extends &ldquo;<b>the golden sceptre toward Esther</b>&rdquo; who is
representing the believers, who find grace in God&rsquo;s sight, as she found grace
in King Ahasuerus&rsquo; sight, do we even see the reason why it is in the Bible.  It
is only at that point that we understand why God put it in the Bible.  </p>

<p>Or Ruth, that account of the great redeemer of Boaz who
takes Ruth to wife, it is the Gospel the spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>Well, some people might admit, yes ,there are parts of the
Bible you have to understand like that, but you know there is also a lot of
history that you have to take only has history.  Or, you can learn some moral
teaching from it.  </p>

<p>Go to Psalm 78, Psalm 78 is a Psalm. If you were to read it,
it is pretty long and that describes or gives information about Israel&rsquo;s
sojourn in the wilderness primarily, and yet it begins in verses 1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give ear, O my people &hellip;  </p>

<p>And God is always doing that, He wants to know if we are
hearing.  Because so many &ldquo;<b>hearing, they hear not</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">Give ear, O my people, <i>to </i>my law: incline your ears to
the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark
sayings of old:  </p>

<p>And again, we see that this is speaking of Israel in the
wilderness and the various things that happened to them. And that gives us
justification to go back to Exodus, or to go back to the earlier books and look
at their wilderness sojourn, and to say now spiritually, here is what that &ldquo;<b>rock</b>&rdquo;

represents, here is the &ldquo;<b>water</b>&rdquo; gushing out of the &ldquo;<b>rock.</b>&rdquo; This
is what that typifies.  And God even tells us in 1 Corinthians 10, that &ldquo;<b>rock</b>&rdquo;
was Christ, He tells us so we cannot miss it.  On and on and on. Actually, as
we do this more and more in the Bible, we see it is actually a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo; 
Yes, but there are parts someone would stubbornly hold out, if the New
Testament does not explain it, then we are not to understand it as a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Let us go to Galatians 4. In Galatians 4, it says in verses
21-24: </p>

<p class="verse">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?  </p>

<p>Again, do you have ears to hear?  Do you hear the law?  And
a good Jew would say, &ldquo;Yes, I hear the law, I know I am to keep the Sabbath day
and to be circumcised.&rdquo;  No, you are not hearing the law.  What does
circumcision mean?  Circumcision of the heart where our sins are cut off.  What
does it mean to keep the seventh day holy, the Sabbath?  It means that in the
matter of salvation, God does everything, and we do no work whatsoever, or else
we die like the man who picked up a few sticks.  You see, God is saying, &ldquo;<b>do
ye not hear the law?</b>&rdquo; Do you not understand what I am telling you?</p>

<p class="verse">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he <i>who was </i>of the bondwoman was
born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman <i>was </i>by promise. Which
things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; &hellip;  </p>

<p>God just called them &ldquo;<b>an allegory,</b>&rdquo; which is another
way of saying &ldquo;<b>parable</b>,&rdquo; hyperbolic language means &ldquo;<b>parable</b>,&rdquo;
poetic language means &ldquo;<b>parable</b>.&rdquo;  And here &ldquo;<b>an allegory</b>&rdquo;

definitely is a &ldquo;parable&rdquo; because it is setting up the &ldquo;<b>two sons</b>&rdquo; of
Abraham, the one born by Sarah, and the other born by Hagar, and God is saying,
they are like &ldquo;<b>two covenants.</b>&rdquo; Just like Jesus would say, &ldquo;<b>the </b><b>kingdom</b><b>
 of </b><b>Heaven</b><b> is like,</b>&rdquo; God is saying that those &ldquo;<b>two sons</b>&rdquo;

are like &ldquo;<b>two covenants</b>.&rdquo;  Well, if you go back to Genesis 16 through 22
where we read about Isaac, and we read about Ishmael and their mothers, there
is no clue there that God is speaking parabolically or spiritually.  It is just
presented as history.  Now if you follow the methodology of the churches, they say,
Okay, if the New Testament opens it up, or explains it, you can take that as a &ldquo;<b>parable.</b>&rdquo;
So what you do is when you come to Genesis 16, and you start reading about
Isaac and Ishmael and their mothers in that true history. You can understand
that spiritually, but as soon as you get to Genesis 23, stop, stop there, you
cannot understand spiritually as God goes on with further history.  </p>

<p>Now, how can anyone really, they will not say this, but that
is what they are teaching.  How can anyone think that there are whole segments
like the wilderness sojourn that has spiritual meaning like the &ldquo;<b>two sons</b>&rdquo;
of Abraham, the &ldquo;<b>two covenants</b>&rdquo; that have spiritual meaning. How can
anyone think that the whole Bible, that it is not all the Word of God?  And we
know it is, because Jesus the Word said, I speak in &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo; and
without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; I do not speak.  And really we see this is how we
are to come to the Bible.  This is how God hid truth.  </p>

<p>If you turn to Proverbs 2:1-5, where is says:</p>

<p class="verse">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments
with thee;  </p>

<p>As Psalm 119 says, &ldquo;<b>Thy word have I hid in mine heart,
that I might not sin against thee</b>&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and </i>apply
thine heart to understanding; Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and </i>liftest
up thy voice for understanding; If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest
for her as <i>for </i>hid treasures; Then shalt thou understand the fear of
JEHOVAH, and find the knowledge of God.  </p>

<p>See God is telling us that is how we go to the Bible, with a
shovel, and a pick ax, looking for gold, looking for silver, looking for
treasure.  Start digging, dig, study with a Concordance and an Interlinear
Bible as helps, and some of the other books we have as helps.  Look into the
Word because there is buried treasure, there is buried nuggets of gold of God&rsquo;s
wisdom, and pieces of silver of His wisdom. And this is God&rsquo;s direction to man,
to anyone who would desire to know Him truly, then start reading the Bible. 
Not casually, not on the surface, but read it in a way that you are studying
what it says, and you will find that there are great spiritual riches that God
reveals to us in His Word.  </p>

<p>Now, we began talking about Dr. White in that debate who
said he can give accounts and instances when Jesus was not speaking in a &ldquo;<b>parable,</b>&rdquo;
where there are verses in the Bible we have to admit that are not parabolic. 
Let us go back to Romans 5, and look at verse 1 again: </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ:  </p>

<p>Is that a parabolic statement?  </p>

<p>Or go to Genesis 1:1:</p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  </p>

<p>Or go to John 3:16: </p>

<p class="verse">For God so [<i>or in this manner</i>] loved the world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.  </p>

<p>Is that a parabolic statement?</p>

<p>How about Romans 10:13: </p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.  </p>

<p>There are lots of verses like that, are they &ldquo;<b>parables</b>&rdquo;? 
Well on one hand no, it is not in the form of a &ldquo;<b>parable&rdquo;</b> like &ldquo;<b>the </b><b>kingdom</b><b>
 of </b><b>Heaven</b><b> is like</b>.&rdquo; These verses are not given to us in that
way.  </p>

<p>But if you had to summarize what a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; is, if
you had to break it down to its barest bones, just look at what a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;
is. What is the essence of a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;?  We mentioned it earlier, it is
spiritual, but not always.  The essence of a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; is to hide
truth.  That is the reason Jesus said, I speak to them because &ldquo;<b>they seeing
see not; and hearing they hear not</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now in Romans 5:1, we are &ldquo;<b>justified by faith.</b>&rdquo; Is
that to be understood just as it says? That is why some people say, &ldquo;Well I
believe, I have faith, I am justified.&rdquo;  No, because we have to study more of
the Bible to understand. To be &ldquo;<b>justified by faith</b>&rdquo; is not our faith, it
is Christ&rsquo;s faith.  Is there hidden truth in Romans 5:1?  Yes, there is.  </p>

<p>How about in Genesis 1:1: </p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  </p>

<p>Well, God did create &ldquo;<b>the heaven and the earth</b>&rdquo; but
there is hidden truth there. In the word &ldquo;<b>God</b>&rdquo; it is <i>Elohiym,</i>
which is a spiritual word for God.  And you cannot understand that until you
read other parts of the Bible that reveals God is triune. In that sense, you
can use the plural to describe Him, and He is the Creator.  So there are two statements.</p>

<p>What about John 3:16, which so many people thought was very
simple and easy?  And it is really one of the most difficult verses in the
Bible.  It hides all kinds of truth, as it says: </p>

<p class="verse">For God [in this manner] loved the world &hellip; </p>

<p>Now right there, people think God loves everyone, they are
off, just taking the plain surface meaning.  They do not understand:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; that he gave his only begotten Son, &hellip;   </p>

<p>Sure, when Jesus came into the world, and then went to the
Cross, that is when God gave him.  No, now we have learned it was before the
foundation of the world &ldquo;<b>that he gave his only begotten Son</b>.&rdquo;  That
Christ became the Son when He rose from the dead.</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish &hellip;  </p>

<p>People get it wrong all the time.  Accept Christ, believe in
Jesus, and you will not perish,  you will live. Wrong, wrong, because that is
an act of our will, and we cannot get ourselves saved.  We cannot create within
us &ldquo;<b>a new heart,</b>&rdquo; God Himself has to do that.  But you see in that one
verse there are a lot of hidden truths.  </p>

<p>Or go to Romans 10, which is also one of the example verses
I gave in verse 13:</p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.  </p>

<p>No, we have to search more of the Bible. And God tells us &ldquo;<b><i>there</i>
<i>is</i> none that calleth upon thy name.</b>&rdquo; In Isaiah 64:7 it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>there is </i>none that calleth upon thy name, that
stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: &hellip;  </p>

<p>Just like at a Crusade in the stadium, they might as well
all go home, and whoever is doing the preaching, might as well not even bother.
But they see an emotional stirring, they see through dramatics, either a
dramatic presentation of the Gospel, or something like that, that people do
respond and walk down an aisle, and that there might be a couple thousand people
that take that step. But God says, &ldquo;<b>none that calleth upon thy name.</b>&rdquo;
Because we are all sinners, none of us understand, none of us are good, none
are righteous, none call upon His name, and no one can stir up his dead soul to
take hold of Him.  It is an impossibility, it is an absolute impossibility, but
God just simply says:</p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.  </p>

<p>But we cannot understand until we search the Bible. And we
find the only one who will call upon Him is the individual that is already been
saved, and then is able to respond in a spiritual way to God.  </p>

<p>I tried to think. Is there a verse in the Bible that does
not hide truth?  Is there a verse somewhere that God is not hiding truth?  And
if you have one, please let me know, please let me know.  See, without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;
He did not speak, and the essence of a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; is hidden truth.  It
applies to Jesus&rsquo; statements, &ldquo;<b>the kingdom of heaven is like,</b>&rdquo; it
applies to historical &ldquo;<b>parables</b>,&rdquo; it applies to plain Gospel statements
that we just read.  It is the whole Bible, the whole Bible.  Now that is very
helpful when we finally realize that, that without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; means God
did not speak without hiding truth, because some people who have learned the
proper hermeneutic of the Bible, which is &ldquo;<b>comparing spiritual things with
spiritual</b>&rdquo; and they also take the verse, without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; Christ
did not speak. And then they go to Romans 9 and they say, &ldquo;you cannot say that &ldquo;<b>five
months</b>&rdquo; is a literal period of time, you cannot say that because it has to
be understood spiritually.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Or they are also saying now, May 21, 2011 cannot be a
literal earthquake, it cannot be, because that is the day God is going to
darken the sun and the moon, and the stars will fall, all of that is spiritual
language of God removing the Gospel.  Well, so is the earthquake.  No, No,
without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; Christ did not speak, and hidden truth normally is
spiritual.  Hidden truth overwhelmingly is spiritual truth, that is, it is a
spiritual element like the sun being darkened, it is not literally the sun in
the sky.  </p>

<p>But the &ldquo;<b>five months</b>&rdquo; is hidden truth too because,
that was in the Bible for centuries and no one knew what it meant until
recently.  Recently we understand, Oh that is from May 21 to October 21, and it
can be called part of a &ldquo;<b>parable,</b>&rdquo; or understood that it is a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo;
in the same way God hides truth throughout the whole Bible.  </p>

<p>God is the One who wrote the Bible, He is the One who gave
us the Bible, and if He wants to talk about &ldquo;<b>locusts</b>&rdquo; swarming, coming
out of the bottomless pit for the &ldquo;<b>five months</b>&rdquo; period, and we know that
is not literal, but that is to be understood spiritually.  And then if He wants
to say in verse 5 of Revelation 9:</p>

<p class="verse">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
that they should be tormented five months: and their torment <i>was</i> as the
torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>

<p>If God wants to say that it is a literal &ldquo;<b>five months</b>&rdquo;

period, that is His privilege, that is His privilege to do, because the
qualifier is, is it hidden, was it hidden truth?  That is what Christ meant
when He said without a &ldquo;<b>parable</b>&rdquo; I did not speak.</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Questions and Answers</span></h2>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:</i>  </b>Two verses, 1
Corinthians 2:14.  I was just thinking in regards to your message. How many out
there hear how Christ spoke in &ldquo;<b>parables?</b>&rdquo; And how it is &ldquo;<b>foolishness</b>&rdquo;

to them?  Of course, God teaches us here through this verse why it is &ldquo;<b>foolishness</b>&rdquo;
to them.</p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>I will read in 1 Corinthians 2:13-14:</p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  </p>

<p>And that is the Bible.  </p>

<p class="verse">But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <i>them, </i>because
they are spiritually discerned.  </p>

<p>That is a fact, that is a fact, that is why churches teach
so many different doctrines, because they do not know what the Bible is
teaching, they do not understand what Christ has said in His Word.  And this is
a big reason in Jeremiah 8:7, this applies to what is going on today:</p>

<p class="verse">Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and
the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but
my people know not the judgment of JEHOVAH.</p>

<p>They cannot know.  If something is &ldquo;<b>spiritually discerned</b>&rdquo;
it is very hazy, it is very foggy.  They maybe are hearing some things like the
Pharisees perceived from time to time that Christ spoke something against them,
but they could not grab a hold of it, or really understand it, because it is
not within them, there is no ability. </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>They are
locked out from any understanding.</p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>Yes they are in darkness.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>Also in
John 3:3, and I think the word &ldquo;<b>see</b>&rdquo; means perceive or understand:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i></b>  We share a lot from the Bible, but it
boils down to if we are truly a child of God. If we are one of God&rsquo;s people,
God will make sure His people do understand, and if we are not, there will be
no understanding.</p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question continued: </i></b> It will
not impact our lives, it will not register.</p>

<p><b><i>Chris: </i></b> Like the people of Noah&rsquo;s day, they
had advance warning, they did not understand it, they still perished in the
flood.  Now another verse that goes along with this is John 8:47, which says:</p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>It is very simple, it is very simple.  Why was Jonah able to
go to Nineveh and say, &ldquo;<b>Yet forty days, and </b><b>Nineveh</b><b> shall be
overthrown</b>.&rdquo;  And that is all he said, one sentence as far as we know, that
is it, and the whole city repented from the king on down.  </p>

<p>And then today, you maybe have had an opportunity to witness
to people and you give them a tract, you give them a book, <b><span class="underline">We Are Almost
There,</span></b> maybe the updated <b><span class="underline">Time Has An End</span></b>, you give them
this literature and it is a good amount of information and they do not believe,
they do not see it.  And you could pile phonebooks worth of information at
someone&rsquo;s feet that teaches the truth from the Bible, and they are not going to
understand it, they are not going to get it.  On the other hand, the flimsiest
little bit of information like Jonah brought to Nineveh and there is great
salvation because, &ldquo;<b>He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>My sheep
hear my voice</b>.&rdquo;  He that is not of God cannot hear.  </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question continued:</i></b>  It is
those whom God has given eternal life.  That is what makes the difference
between those that hear the Word and are doing it, versus those that hear it
and go away.  It does not register or impact their life.  </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:</i></b>  Daniel tells us the wise will
understand, none of the wicked will understand.</p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </i></b>The study today made
me remember about what Jesus was saying, &ldquo;<b>Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up</b>.&rdquo;  And of course they had no clue as to what He was
talking about.  But my question is, is this study pretty much a precursor to
the cliffhanger from last week with Melchisedec?</p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>No, it is not.  I am still working on
Melchisedec.  That is another good verse, where Jesus made a statement, just
like He said to the Disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees, and He said, &ldquo;<b>Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</b>&rdquo; And they all thought
what I can touch, that temple right there, and there were even witnesses, false
witnesses that rose up at His trial, and that was one of the things they were
trying to prove, that He spoke about tearing down the literal temple in
Jerusalem, and again they did not hear, they did not hear, and that is the
nature of fallen man.  </p>
