<p>[<i>I am going to</i>] try to make clear that there are
probably some people that are not aware, or maybe they are just listening on
Paltalk, or through the Internet, we are not a church, we are not a church.  We
are just a bunch of believers, individuals, who meet together on Sunday.  There
is no authority, there is no individual Pastor, Deacon, Elder with any
authority. We are just individuals that meet together, and we just gather
really around the Word of God.  We are fellowshipping with Him through His
Word.  </p>

<p>Now, a while ago, months ago, we were looking at Hebrews 5
and 6. And I would like to start there. I would like to begin there today and then
work some other things in as we go along.  In Hebrews 5:8-14 we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
salvation unto all them that obey him; Called of God an high priest after the
order of Melchisedec. Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be
uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. For when for the time ye ought to be
teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which <i>be </i>the first principles
of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of
strong meat. For every one that useth milk <i>is </i>unskilful in the word of
righteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of
full age, <i>even </i>those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
discern both good and evil.  </p>

<p>And it goes on into chapter 6 where the Lord speaks of &ldquo;<b>leaving
the principals of the doctrine of Christ</b>&rdquo; and going &ldquo;<b>unto perfection.</b>&rdquo;

And we looked at this a while back, as far as what God had in mind with going &ldquo;<b>unto
perfection</b>.&rdquo;  For instance, in verse 14 of Hebrews 5:  </p>

<p class="verse">But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age &hellip;   </p>

<p>And the word &ldquo;<b>full age</b>&rdquo; is one Greek word, and it is <i>teleios,</i>
which is a word that is related to tell us, which has to do with the end.  It
is translated sometimes, the word it is derived from as the end, or the
uttermost, and this word has some of that idea.  That is why the translators
used the English words &ldquo;<b>full age</b>.&rdquo;  It is when something has developed
to completion. And actually, this word &ldquo;<b>full age</b>&rdquo; is translated three
different ways in the New Testament, it is translated as &ldquo;<b>perfect</b>,&rdquo; it
is translated as &ldquo;<b>full age</b>,&rdquo; and it is translated as &ldquo;<b>man</b>.&rdquo; 
Those three words, English words the translators used to translate this Greek
word <i>teleios</i> that is found here in Hebrews 5:14.  </p>

<p>For instance in Matthew 5:48, the word <i>teleios</i> is
there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Perfect</b>&rdquo; in both instances is <i>teleios.  </i>It is
the word that is found in Romans 12:2, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is </i>that good, and
acceptable, and perfect, will of God.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;<b>perfect</b>&rdquo; is the word <i>teleios</i>.  In 1
John 4:18, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear &hellip;  </p>

<p>Because, what is love?  God tells us it is keeping His
commandments. &ldquo;<b>If ye love me, keep my commandments</b>.&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>Perfect love,</b>&rdquo;
which is perfect obedience to the Word of God would cast out fear.  We would
not have moments of doubt, or as we look at our lives, or we see sin in our
lives, we wonder at times, am I really a child of God?  Well, &ldquo;<b>perfect love,</b>&rdquo;
when God completes His salvation within one of those that He has elected to
save, will cast out all that fear.  We are not perfect in love yet, we are not
perfectly obeying God in this world except in the new spirit He has given us. 
But really, we have to admit that we are still with sin, as it also tells us in
1 John.  Yet, this word &ldquo;<b>perfect,</b>&rdquo; is <i>teleios</i>.  Now it is used in
1 Corinthians 13, in this very familiar passage about love or charity.  It says
in verses 8-9 of 1 Corinthians 13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be </i>prophecies,
they shall fail; whether <i>there be </i>tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there
be </i>knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in
part.</p>

<p>When did &ldquo;<b>we know in part</b>&rdquo;?  Actually, throughout the
history of the world, but especially during the church age, there was partial
understanding, partial knowledge of the Bible.  That is why we are learning so
many new things now about judgment and the Resurrection, and the timeline of
history, and many, many other teachings.  So during the church age, the Christians,
whether saved or unsaved, whether truly God&rsquo;s people or not, knew &ldquo;<b>in part</b>,&rdquo;
partial knowledge.  And that is because God sealed up the Word till the time of
the end.  And then He says in verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 13:</p>

<p class="verse">But when that which is perfect is come &hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Perfect</b>,&rdquo; that is the word.  Who is &ldquo;<b>perfect,</b>&rdquo;
but God. &ldquo;<b>Be ye therefore perfect</b>&rdquo; is the command to us, &ldquo;<b>even as
your Father which is in Heaven is perfect</b>.&rdquo; When God comes, we always
thought at the end of the world, He destroys this world we are in, &ldquo;<b>the new
heavens and the new earth,</b>&rdquo; and that is when knowledge will increase.  No,
knowledge is increasing now at this time.  The Holy Spirit, the perfect is come<b>.</b> 
He set His hand a second time in pouring out of the Gospel, the latter rain
period, to recover a remnant, His elect people.  And so, He has come at this
point, and that is why knowledge which was &ldquo;<b>in part</b>,&rdquo; it says here, in
verse 10: </p>

<p class="verse">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
part shall be done away.  </p>

<p>People get very upset, they are really disturbed. &ldquo;Are you
telling me that I did not even know what Jesus was doing on the Cross?  That I
even had that wrong?&rdquo;  Yes, you only knew &ldquo;<b>in part</b>&rdquo; because that was a
tableau.  And all of God&rsquo;s people knew &ldquo;<b>in part,</b>&rdquo; but now God is giving
us a better understanding, clearer.  We can see things much clearer because of
the advantage point of being at the end of the world when the Lord is opening
up His Word.  And in verse 11:  </p>

<p class="verse">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.  </p>

<p>Very similar to Hebrews 5 about being a babe, being a babe
you can only use milk.  You have to come to &ldquo;<b>full age</b>,&rdquo; you must come to
be &ldquo;<b>perfect,</b>&rdquo; and it is in the context of understanding the Word of God,
and so is this.  There are several places where the Lord refers to those who
teach the Bible as though they were children, or babes, because spiritually
they are, and they have been.  They have been like a little child, they know a
little bit about the Resurrection, but not all the more complete information. 
They know a little bit about how God saved, but not the much more complete
information we have today, that He did it all before the world began.  And that
is how it is with many doctrines of the Bible.  And it says in verse 12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For now we see through a glass, darkly &hellip;  </p>

<p>That would be through the church age.  That is when God was
moving Paul to write this.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I
know even as also I am known.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Face to face,</b>&rdquo; which is an expression in the Bible
that God uses to really declare that when He speaks &ldquo;<b>face to face</b>&rdquo; with
someone, it is to speak plainly, without hidden truth, without parables, He
will reveal Himself in a much clearer way.  That is what He did with Moses. 
The Lord spoke with Moses &ldquo;<b>face to face</b>&rdquo; it says in one place, and &ldquo;<b>mouth
to mouth</b>&rdquo; in another place.  In Numbers 12, you can read that; in making
that statement, I speak with Moses &ldquo;<b>mouth to mouth</b>&rdquo; in order that he
will have, let me turn there, I cannot remember it exactly, in Numbers 12:7-8:</p>

<p class="verse">My servant Moses <i>is </i>not so &hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, the LORD was just speaking to Aaron and Miriam who
were trying to indicate that they also were prophets, just like Moses, and God
was correcting them that Moses is a special case: </p>

<p class="verse">My servant Moses <i>is </i>not so, who <i>is </i>faithful in all
mine house. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
dark speeches; and the similitude of JEHOVAH shall he behold &hellip;  </p>

<p>That is what God is indicating. There are other references
to &ldquo;<b>face to face,</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<b>mouth to mouth,</b>&rdquo; because that is the most
or the clearest form of communication still.  Emails are not that clear, phone
calls you cannot see a person&rsquo;s face, a letter is good, but if you really want
to make sure someone understands, &ldquo;<b>face to face</b>.&rdquo;  So I see your
reaction, you see my reaction, and then it is the most complete way of
learning, or the most complete form of communication still in this electronic
age, person to person, in one&rsquo;s presence.  And that is what God is saying in 1
Corinthians 13, that the partial knowledge will be done away when He speaks
with His people &ldquo;<b>face to face,</b>&rdquo; He will reveal more and more truths of
the Bible at that time.  </p>

<p>Now if we go to 1 Corinthians 14, the next chapter, <i>teleios</i>,
the word translated &ldquo;<b>full age</b>&rdquo; in Hebrews 5, is found in verse 20 of 1
Corinthians 14: </p>

<p class="verse">Brethren, be not children in understanding &hellip;  </p>

<p>See that theme?  It is in Hebrews, you are a babe.  It was
in 1 Corinthians 13, &ldquo;<b>I thought as a child,</b>&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>I spake as a child</b>.&rdquo; 
And here again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Brethren &hellip;  </p>

<p>That is believers, true believers:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice [or <i>evil</i>]
be ye children, but in understanding be men.  </p>

<p>Here is where the original language is so necessary because
in English, we would just assume well, it means like grow up, grow up, be a
man.  That is the idea, but actually, &ldquo;<b>men</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>in understanding be men</b>,&rdquo;

is <i>teleios</i>.  It is the same word in these other places that is
translated &ldquo;<b>perfect,</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<b>full age</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>in understanding be
perfect</b>.&rdquo;  Do not be a child any longer, do not be a babe, but in
understanding &ldquo;<b>go unto perfection,</b>&rdquo; as it says in Hebrews 6:1, &ldquo;<b>leaving
the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go unto perfection,</b>&rdquo;

perfection.  And what is perfection as far as understanding the Bible?  Well,
it just simply means that whatever God wants us to understand, we will
understand.  The full measure of the cup of knowledge, we could say it was only
partially full throughout the church age but now God is giving us the full
measure of everything He wants His people to know before the world ends, even
though we are not going to understand everything in the Bible.  There are many
things that maybe we will not know.  We can know even some things, and realize
we do not know much about it, like the Trinity.  Yes, we know the Bible teaches
the Trinity. But how can we understand three persons, but one God? We cannot. 
So whatever the Lord wants us to know of &ldquo;<b>the secret <i>things</i> <i>belong</i>
unto the </b><b>LOD</b><b> our God: but those <i>things</i> which are revealed <i>belong</i>
unto us</b>,&rdquo; it is what He gives us, it is Him in parting understanding to His
people.  And that is what 1 Corinthians 14 is saying here.</p>

<p>Let us also go to Ephesians 4 where we find <i>teleios</i>. 
In verse 11, I will start:</p>

<p class="verse">And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints,
for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we
all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, </p>

<p>That is that same word.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip; unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:  </p>

<p>That is what God is saying here, move &ldquo;<b>unto perfection</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p class="verse">That we <i>henceforth </i>be no more children &hellip;  </p>

<p>Once again, children, if you have not achieved the &ldquo;<b>perfect</b>&rdquo;
understanding in how God means that, that is, coming to a better and clearer
understanding of judgment, of what May 21, 2011 means, of what the Resurrection
is, of God&rsquo;s penalty for sin which is death, annihilation, not eternal
suffering in hell.  If you have not moved in the direction of the Bible&rsquo;s
teaching as God is teaching us at this time through His Word, you remain a
babe, you remain a child, spiritually, and you have need of milk, and not &ldquo;<b>strong
meat,</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<b>sure meat</b>.&rdquo;  That word &ldquo;<b>strong</b>&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;<b>sure,</b>&rdquo;

where it says, &ldquo;<b>the foundation of God standeth sure</b>.&rdquo;   It is &ldquo;<b>sure
meat</b>,&rdquo; it is truth, pure truth, 100% truth, not partial truth, but truth
that God has hid until our day, until this time that He wants His people to
understand and know.  So He says:</p>

<p class="verse">That we <i>henceforth </i>be no more children, tossed to and
fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine &hellip;  </p>

<p>We see how the word &ldquo;<b>perfect</b>&rdquo; is used in relationship
to the teaching of the Bible.  And that is what the Lord wants His people to
begin to understand.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Hebrews 6, Hebrews 5 and 6, it says in
verses 1-2 of Hebrews 6:</p>

<p class="verse">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let
us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from
dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying
on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  </p>

<p>Now if you study theology, or the churches teachings over
the centuries, they got all of it wrong, little, little truth as far as
baptism. Look at all the different teachings in the various churches on baptism
alone.  They did not understand baptism as a sign of the washing away of sin. 
They got it wrong.  </p>

<p>Well, we are not going to go through all that again, we did
that before. But in this context, we find a little further down in chapter 6,
where the Lord speaks of &ldquo;<b>those who were once enlightened,</b>&rdquo; <b>if they
fall away it is impossible</b> &ldquo;<b>to renew them again unto repentance,</b>&rdquo;

which applies to our day.  So we know that the Lord in this passage is making
reference to our time when salvation or repentance is impossible within the
churches because the Holy Spirit has come out of the midst.  And that is the
context of what we are reading in Hebrews 5 and 6.  </p>

<p>But actually, there is a context here that I never noticed
before. If you look at verses 10-11 of Hebrews 5, it is interesting how God has
worked this person into the discussion.   </p>

<p class="verse">Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. Of
whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of
hearing.  </p>

<p>And then He goes into speaking of not being a babe but
coming to &ldquo;<b>full age,</b>&rdquo; and to &ldquo;<b>strong meat</b>,&rdquo; to &ldquo;<b>sure meat</b>,&rdquo;

and it is really a discussion of Melchisedec.  And then God says, you cannot
understand Him because &ldquo;<b>ye are dull of hearing.</b>&rdquo; And that word &ldquo;<b>dull</b>&rdquo;
is only translated one other place in the next chapter as &ldquo;<b>slothful</b>.&rdquo; 
It is just, not quick to hear, very slow, very much like a sluggard or a
sloth.  I saw a sloth in Bolovia when we took our trip there this past year. 
It was on a tree in a Bolivian Zoo in Santa Cruz, and we went in, and the sloth
was hanging from a tree, and my wife Maria went up and tried to pet it, and as
she touched it, it came around with its claws very, very slow, but Maria must
be slower because it got her.  But the sloth came around and then got her skin
a little bit, but the animal does not move fast, it does not move fast at all.
And that is what God is saying, &ldquo;<b>ye are dull of hearing,</b>&rdquo; you cannot
hear it now.  </p>

<p>It is just like when Jesus would say things to His Disciples
and they could not comprehend, they could not get it, they could not
understand. But the Lord says in one place, let these words sink down in you,
into your ears.  He is just pointing out that even though God&rsquo;s people have
been slow by God&rsquo;s design to understand these things because He sealed them up,
there will come a time when He reveals truth to His people.  He has &ldquo;<b>many
things to say</b>&rdquo; about Melchisedec, and then He breaks off in the discussion
towards the end of chapter 5, into chapter 6. And if you look at the last verse
of Hebrews 6, He says:</p>

<p class="verse">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <i>even </i>Jesus,
made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  </p>

<p>It is like book ends.  And then chapter 7 goes into detail
about Melchisedec.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to chapter 4 of Hebrews, and really, this is
where one of the places where the discussion of Melchisedec begins in verse 14
of Hebrews 4:</p>

<p class="verse">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our </i>profession. 
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Jesus the Son of God.</b>&rdquo; Whenever we see &ldquo;<b>the Son
of God,</b>&rdquo; that name, or title given to the Lord Jesus, we can know immediately
that it is saying, Jesus, the One who rose from the dead before the foundation
of the world to become &ldquo;<b>the Son of God,</b>&rdquo; victoriously, is really what
the Bible is saying. Every place we read, &ldquo;<b>the Son of God,</b>&rdquo; or God calls
Him the &ldquo;<b>Son of man,</b>&rdquo; and He is the &ldquo;<b>Son of man,</b>&rdquo; because He was
born of a virgin and entered into the human race, and God has some special
significance attached to that name.  But when Jesus is called &ldquo;<b>the Son of
God,</b>&rdquo; always it is because He rose from the dead. And we can know that
every time we read this name of Christ. </p>

<p>Let us go to Revelation 13:8. This is becoming a very
familiar verse, which says:</p>

<p class="verse">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world.  </p>

<p>So Jesus is &ldquo;<b>the Lamb.</b>&rdquo; As John the Baptist called
Him, &ldquo;<b>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</b>&rdquo;  Well
here, God tells us that He was slain, He was killed, and He tells us when,
before the foundation of the world. That is when Christ died for the sins of
His people, that is when He was laden with iniquity, He bore our sins in His
body, that is when God poured out His wrath upon Him and Jesus made payment for
sin.  Now Him, bearing sin, making payment for sin, happened before the
foundation of the world.  It did not happen on the Cross. It did not happen in
the Garden.  Jesus was living it out because He is &ldquo;<b>the light of the world</b>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<b>whatsoever doth make manifest is light,</b>&rdquo; and the Bible tells us He
was making these things manifest, He was putting them all on display.  He was
showing us He was shining the light on the truth, that God had already punished
Him for sin, and He had already victoriously won the battle, and He had
Resurrected.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Hebrews 4:3:</p>

<p class="verse">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works
were finished from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>See, it is not just Revelation 13:8 that teaches us that.
And some people, they try to say, &ldquo;Well, that is just the reference. From
before the foundation of the world is only addressing those who were written in
the Lambs book of life.&rdquo; And they try to get around the statement that Christ
is the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world, saying that it does
not apply to from before the foundation of the world. </p>

<p>But there are other Scriptures that make no sense unless we
realize that Jesus was &ldquo;<b>the Lamb</b>&rdquo; and did die as &ldquo;<b>the Lamb of God</b>,&rdquo;

the sacrifice for His people&rsquo;s sins.  And the works necessary to save God&rsquo;s
elect were finished back then at that point, before the world began.  You know
God is really, as Bob was saying in his report, the Lord gets all the glory.
God is revealing that yes, He gets all the glory for salvation, even more glory
then we imagined, because we thought yes, we understood it was &ldquo;<b>the faith of
Christ</b>&rdquo; and God gives us the gift of salvation, but still, He has gone
beyond that, and showed us that it was all accomplished, finished, all the
works necessary that Jesus did to save His people were completed before there
was any man; &ldquo;<b>of the people <i>there</i> <i>was</i> none with me</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>mine
own arm brought salvation</b> <b>unto me</b>.&rdquo;  He was alone, completely alone,
because He had not yet created the world, or man in the world, and of course it
is all of Him.  It is God&rsquo;s salvation there is no one else.  </p>

<p>Now if we start from that point, then we really in sharing
the Gospel with people, we are starting at a point where only God could
possibly get the glory.  There is not even a possibility for man to foul it up,
or to pollute it, to pervert the Gospel of Grace, because it is all done,
finished before God even created this world.  And we can see how this
understanding much more greatly glorifies God.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Matthew 25. In Matthew 25:34 where it is a
parable that Jesus is giving regarding the sheep and the goats, &ldquo;<b>as a
shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats,</b>&rdquo; and then in verse 34:</p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world:  </p>

<p>There is evidence, actually it is conclusive, it is
conclusive, Jesus died, He finished the works, He prepared the Kingdom, He
named His elect and died for their sins, all before, way before this world
began.  And so He is a God who gets the honour and the glory, and man, we are
the recipients of God&rsquo;s grace, He worked it out in order to bless His people.</p>

<p>Let us also go to 1 Peter 2:24. Speaking of Christ: </p>

<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree &hellip;   </p>

<p>Now it is saying Jesus was bearing sins.  Pilate found Him
with no fault, &ldquo;<b>I find no fault</b> <b>in him.</b>&rdquo; Because He was sinless. 
He was not bearing sins in 33 AD, He bore sins prior to the world&rsquo;s existence and
here it says:   </p>

<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree &hellip;  </p>

<p>Which means, what does it mean if He bore our sins?  When
would that have been?  At what point, not in time, at what point?  Prior to the
world, before the foundation of the world.  But it says He bore, &ldquo;<b>our sins
in his own body on the tree.</b>&rdquo; That is the Cross, right?  33 AD?  No, it is
not the Cross. It is teaching, He bore our sins before the foundation of the
world. And to prove this, we just have to think, Revelation 13:8 says, He was
the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world.  Was there any lambs
back then? Did God create lambs before He created the world?  He did not create
lambs back then before He spoke and created the world and universe. But the
word &ldquo;<b>Lamb</b>&rdquo; means, Jesus was the sacrifice for His people&rsquo;s sins, not
that He was an actual lamb.  </p>

<p>Likewise, the word &ldquo;<b>tree</b>&rdquo; is very important because
it points to the Cross and the Cross if you were to look at it in its essence,
you know to bare bones. What does the Cross teach us?  Anyone that hangs on a
tree is cursed and has been made a shameful spectacle.  Did that happen before
the foundation of the world?  Was Jesus accursed?  Yes, with the sins of His
people.  Was He put on display? Or actually, that is one of the reasons why
Christ entered into the world, to reveal these things in a tableau. But He was
shamed before the foundation of the world, and cursed before the foundation of
the world, which means He hung on a tree, because that is what the tree teaches. 
That is what the Cross, the spiritual essence, or the truth of the reference to
the tree is teaching.  </p>

<p>So Jesus, &ldquo;<b>his own self bare our sins in his own body on
the tree.</b>&rdquo; And that is the reason why we want to look at Melchisedec.  Did
Jesus have a body before the foundation of the world?  It says here He did.  It
cannot be 33 AD because He is bearing sins, and it says He had a body.  No, he
was not born of a virgin back then, but God gave Him a body because this verse
tells us so. And this is the Greek word <i>soma</i>, it is a word that means
body, just like you have a body, I have a body. God gave Christ a body before
the foundation of the world in order that He could bare the sins of man, and
die for the sins of man, and then later be Resurrected in a victorious
resurrection proving that He had paid the penalty in full for His people.  </p>

<p>How did Christ get a body? Well, I think there is a verse
that tells us how He got a body, and we will try to look at that later, but
first we have to go a little bit more, because in backtracking and
understanding that Jesus died, but the Bible also tells us He rose. And if we
go to Romans 1:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh; And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by [or <i>out of</i>] the
resurrection from the dead:  </p>

<p>When we read this, we have gone over this, but it is easy to
forget, it is easy for us to not understand, or to slip back into where we do
not understand it correctly. And this verse is saying if we leave out just the
center part of the verse for a second, it is saying that Jesus was declared to
be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead, or through, or out of the
resurrection from the dead.  In other words, Jesus, when He was laden with sin,
when He was bearing sin before the foundation of the world was Jesus, God,
Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ, all the many names of God. But one name did not
apply at that time until He made payment and Resurrected, and once He
Resurrected, then He was declared to be &ldquo;<b>the</b> <b>Son of God</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>the
Son of God.</b>&rdquo;  That is a name that teaches us, this name means Christ died
and rose victoriously, &ldquo;<b>the Son of God,</b>&rdquo; that applies to Him.  He was
given that name upon His Resurrection.  Now if we go to Hebrews 1:1-5:</p>

<p class="verse">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us
by <i>his </i>Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds; Who being the brightness of <i>his </i>glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he
had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high; Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he
at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will
be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?  </p>

<p>It is a quote from Psalm 2. If we go back to the Psalms, in
Psalm 2:7:</p>

<p class="verse">I will declare the decree: JEHOVAH hath said unto me, Thou <i>art
</i>my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Thou <i>art</i> my Son</b>&rdquo; was stated by God the moment
Jesus rose from the dead, that is when He was begotten. Of course, He is
eternal God, and He has always been God from eternity past, and always will be
God, but at point in eternity. It is as though He was the first begotten of God
because He rose from the dead.  As it says in Colossians 1:17-18: </p>

<p class="verse">And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And
he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn
from the dead; that in all <i>things </i>he might have the preeminence.  </p>

<p>It is referring to Jesus.  Or also in Revelation 1:5 it
says: </p>

<p class="verse">And from Jesus Christ, <i>who is </i>the faithful witness, <i>and
</i>the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>The first begotten of the dead</b>&rdquo; is why God says in
John 3:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">For God [or in this manner] so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son &hellip;  </p>

<p>Already the Son, He had not died, He had not Resurrected,
that would be of a period of time. But God says, He is my Son. How could God
call Him His Son if He had not already been Resurrected and declared to be the
Son of God as He is &ldquo;<b>the first begotten?</b>&rdquo; Well, I would like to go back
to Hebrews 5. In Hebrews 4, we read of &ldquo;<b>Jesus the Son of God</b>&rdquo; who was
the &ldquo;<b>high priest</b>&rdquo; for His people. And then in Hebrews 5:1-6:</p>

<p class="verse">For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
in things <i>pertaining </i>to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins: Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of
the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. And by reason
hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. And
no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as <i>was
</i>Aaron. So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but
he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he
saith also in another <i>place, </i>Thou <i>art </i>a priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedec.  </p>

<p>So God is joining Psalm 2:7 with the statement about Melchisedec.
He says in another place. Why?  What is the point that God is trying to make
regarding Melchisedec?  Melchisedec is a mysterious character, theologians call
him a theophany.  Theologians also say that Jesus was slain in principle before
the foundation of the world, and they were incorrect about that.  Melchisedec
appears first in the book of Genesis in chapter 14. And that chapter is very
interesting, because it really records the first kings that are mentioned in
the Bible, it records the first war that is mentioned in the Bible. It also has
Abraham arm his trained servants and three other men and go after his nephew Lot,
and Lot&rsquo;s goods, and other inhabitants of cities that were overcome. And
Abraham rescues Lot and all the people, and all the goods, and then he comes
back to Sodom. And then we find this priest. This priest comes out with bread
and wine, and Abraham gives this priest a tenth of the portion of all that he
took. And so, Melchisedec received tithes, and that was between the years of
2092 BC and 2081 BC.  We can know that definitely because, 2092 BC is the year
that Abraham came out of Ur of the Chaldees, or Haran, and entered into the land
 of Canaan.  And 2081 BC is the year when other events were going on in his
life that had already passed by this battle in Genesis 14.  So it was right
around 2100 BC. And then the next mention of Melchisedec is in the Psalms. In
Psalm 110, where the LORD is moving David to write a Psalm. And it says in
verses 1-4:</p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool. JEHOVAH shall send the rod of thy strength
out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people <i>shall be </i>willing
in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning:
thou hast the dew of thy youth. JEHOVAH hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou <i>art

</i>a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  </p>

<p>He just mysteriously shows up again. And David, we know
lived from 1037 BC to 967 BC, so probably around 1000 BC he was writing these
Psalms.  The Bible does not tell us exactly, but about 1,000 years from the
time Melchisedec first showed up on the scene in around 2100 BC, 1,000 years
later, God moves David to mention him. And then, it is not for another 1,000
years, 1<sup>st</sup> century AD that God moves the writer of Hebrews to make
reference to Melchisedec and go into a lot more detail about this man.  Who was
this man?  Well, Jesus is the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the
world, and He came into the world in 33 AD to teach us that, and to show us
that, and to make that manifest, and John the Baptist when He saw Him said, &ldquo;<b>Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world</b>.&rdquo;  Who offered
Jesus up in 33 AD?  Because if you have a sacrifice you also need a priest to
offer the sacrifice. Who offered Him up?  He offered Himself up, He is the &ldquo;<b>great
high priest</b>&rdquo; of His people.  So, He was &ldquo;<b>the Lamb</b>&rdquo; and He was the &ldquo;<b>high
priest</b>.&rdquo;  Now before the foundation of the world Jesus was the Lamb? Where
was the Priest, who offered Him up?  Well, He offered Himself up, yes that is
true, that is true, under the name of Melchisedec.</p>

<p>And Lord willing, we will try to study that a little bit
more into chapter 7 and a little further in Hebrews.</p>

<p>We are going to close right now, and let us close with a
word of prayer.</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Questions and Answers (paraphrased)</span></h2>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:</i>  </b>My question is still
formulating in my head. But I just want to say that the way you ended the
message was better then the season finale of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, because it is a
cliff hanger.  I cannot wait to hear what else you have to say.  But my
question is this. When it comes to the exposure to the doctrine of everything
being completed before the foundation of the earth, what is going through my
mind is, in regards to a question about whether or not Christ was capable of
falling because of His human nature when He entered into the world, when He was
tempted of the devil and so forth. </p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>The Bible tells us God cannot be
tempted of evil.  Satan certainly tempted Him, and the Pharisees, and the
leaders of Israel were constantly going after Him.  God just put on display
there also His perfection, His holiness and His perfect obedience in order to
show us. So He submitted Himself to these tests to show us really the ideal or
how He created Adam in the beginning to be good, and perfect, and to obey Him.
And so, He came as the second Adam to show these things.  </p>

<p><b><i>Question (continued):  </i></b>I think that answers
the question because I had asked this question a long time ago, this was back
when I was still going to church and there was an answer given that, because of
His human nature, there was a chance that He could have fallen, but that is not
correct.</p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>Why should we speculate or get into
what ifs?  It did not happen.  We do know that God makes it very clear, He was
the perfect God-man in every way. And when we see Him for instance, in the
wilderness being tempted of the devil, He was showing us that here is the
ideal.  This glorifies God to obey Him, to refer to His Word for understanding
and direction and strength.  The way we find Jesus presented in the Bible, the
way He lived His life, we can just thank God, and glorify God that He lived
perfectly and obediently.</p>

<p><b><i>Question:</i></b> Within 60 seconds can you give us an
insight into where you left off at?  </p>

<p>Chris: I am trying to learn some things for the conference.
But in Hebrews 7, there are a couple statements made. I will just point out one
that really I think should have us thinking.  Verse 14:</p>

<p class="verse">For <i>it is </i>evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of
which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>

<p>So God is trying to lay out how Jesus is a legitimate
Priest, but not due to earthly ties to Aaron, no, He is actually a far greater
Priest because He is connected to Melchisedec, He is after the order of
Melchisedec.  Verse 15:</p>

<p class="verse">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of
Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  </p>

<p>And who is that other Priest?  Jesus.  Do you notice
anything about that statement, &ldquo;<b>after the similitude of Melchisedec</b>&rdquo;? 
It is reversed, it is normally Melchisedec a type of Christ. Melchisedec is a
similitude of Jesus, but it is not saying that, it is saying Jesus came &ldquo;<b>after
the similitude of Melchisedec</b>.&rdquo;  He came after the likeness of this
mysterious man, Melchisedec.  We will try to get into the word &ldquo;<b>similitude</b>&rdquo;

another time, but it has reversed the types and figures order, is what its
done.  And there would be absolutely no way of understanding that except we
have learned that Jesus when He entered into the world was living out a
tableau, a &ldquo;<b>similitude</b>&rdquo; of what had already taken place and been
accomplished.  And so that statement I think is key.</p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question: </i></b> Inaudible</p>

<p><b><i>Chris:  </i></b>1 Thessalonians 3:4:</p>

<p class="verse">For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.  </p>

<p>Well, when we have a word we want to find out information
about, we go to the Strong&rsquo;s and maybe the Englishman&rsquo;s Greek Concordance that
gives us all the English words of where that word is found. And there are many,
many, many places where the Greek word 1492, which I think is <i>eido</i> is
found, and that is how God teaches us.  As we go to one place we make a little
mental note, go to another place, and hopefully starts filling out the word so
we can understand what the word means.  So, I would not just go to this one
verse, I guess is what I am saying, without trying to understand it with all
the other verses too.  </p>
