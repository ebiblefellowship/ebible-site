<p>Today is Easter.  It is Resurrection Sunday, and so I
thought that it would be good for us to look at some verses dealing with the
Lord Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God.  The Bible has a great deal to say about
Jesus as the Lamb of God.  </p>

<p>For instance, in John 1:29, there is this statement made by
John the Baptist:  </p>

<p class="verse">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  </p>

<p>He was calling Jesus a lamb because a lamb was the
sacrificial animal that God had declared would be offered, especially at the
time of Passover as the lamb would be sacrificed as a picture for the sins of Israel. 
Yet in the whole Bible when we read about the Lamb of God or the sacrificial
lamb, it is always pointing to Christ.  </p>

<p>So today I would like to look at some of the history in the
Bible concerning the Lamb of God.  Later we will go back to the Lord Jesus
Himself as He went to the cross.  We could go back many hundreds of years
before this time when Israel was offering up the sacrifices of the lamb at the
time of the Passover feast.  We could even go back further into Biblical
history to find references to a lamb.  </p>

<p>But prior to all of this, there is even more history. 
Before this world was even created, God has things to say about Jesus as the
Lamb of God, which we have been learning lately over the last couple of years. 
</p>

<p>In Revelation 13:8, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world.  </p>

<p>Without question, this is Jesus who is being spoken of.  But
it is not referencing 33 A.D.  It is saying that it was &ldquo;from the foundation of
the world&rdquo; that the Lamb was slain.  What we used to add to this is that it
means &ldquo;in principle,&rdquo; and yet it does not say this at all.  It just says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>Some people may not like this, but this was God&rsquo;s plan.  He
decided, in His infinite wisdom, to lay upon the Lord Jesus Christ the sins of
His people, a great multitude that is perhaps as many as 200 million.  This is
what we are learning today.  </p>

<p>So all of the sins of millions of people were laid upon the
Lord Jesus Christ and, as the Lamb, He was slain.  He was the sacrificial Lamb,
even though there were not lambs before or from the foundation of the world.  There
was not a world.  There was not a cross, as well as none of the things that we
see today.  God just uses the language of the Lamb to indicate that Christ is
that sacrifice.  </p>

<p>For instance, 1 Corinthians 5:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  </p>

<p>He is &ldquo;the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world.&rdquo;  The big emphasis of the Passover was the Passover lamb; and Jesus is
not only called &ldquo;the Lamb,&rdquo; but He is called &ldquo;our passover.&rdquo;  This is another
one of His titles.  </p>

<p>So when we are thinking about Easter, like we are doing
today, that Christ rose from the dead early Sunday morning, this is a good day
to remember that Christ was victorious over sin, even though His victory over
sin did not occur in 33 A.D.  It occurred prior to this from the foundation of
the world.  This is when He was slain and rose.  He was resurrected from the
foundation of the world according to Romans 1:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh; And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead:  </p>

<p>The way in which God wrote this, it is not always easy to
hear what He is saying; but look at Romans 1:4 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God with power&hellip;by the
resurrection from the dead: </p>

<p>If we do not read the statement in the middle, we can see
how this flows.  He was declared to be the Son of God by or through or via the
resurrection of the dead.  </p>

<p>This means that Jesus did not take upon Himself the title or
the name of &ldquo;the Son&rdquo; until He rose from the dead.  It cannot be early that
Sunday morning in 33 A.D. that God is looking at because if you read the Gospel
accounts, long before He rose from the dead He was called &ldquo;the Son of God.&rdquo;  If
you look up the word &ldquo;son&rdquo; in the New Testament, you will see several
references to &ldquo;the Son,&rdquo; and the cross is not even in view.  </p>

<p>How could He be called &ldquo;the Son&rdquo; prior to going to the
cross?  He could be called this because He was the Lamb slain before the world
was created and then He rose from the dead before the world was created.  He
paid the penalty for sin for His elect people long before the world was
created.  </p>

<p>This is why Hebrews 4:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works
were finished from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>Some people insist that Christ paid for sin on the cross in
33 A.D. because they do not like the idea of Jesus dying from the foundation of
the world and rising prior to the world&rsquo;s beginning.  </p>

<p>Why do they not like this?  I can understand why.  One
reason is because we thought that we understood this.  We thought that we at
least understood this about the Bible.  We figured if we knew anything, it was
happening on the cross.  </p>

<p>So this issue is really a matter of humility and humbling
ourselves to what the Bible actually says, which is that He did not die on the
cross to pay for sins.  He did go to the cross and this was a very real thing. 
He did suffer, but He was not bearing sin and He was not paying for sin because
that would have been double jeopardy.  He would have paid for sin a second time
and there was no need for that.  Hebrews 4:3 tells us that &ldquo;the works were
finished,&rdquo; which is past tense, &ldquo;from the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If anyone does not agree with this and insists that He paid
for sin in 33 A.D., then what works were finished?  What works were finished
before the world began?  They would have to answer this.  </p>

<p>Revelation 13:8 says that He was slain.  Romans 1:4 says
that He rose from the dead to be declared the Son of God.  Hebrews tells us
that as the Son, He created the world.  This means that He had already done it
all.  The works were finished, and then He spoke and created the world and the
universe.  </p>

<p>One of the purposes for what God is doing at this time is to
hit at the heart of proud man with these doctrines, with these teachings that
He had hidden until the time of the end.  They are all designed by God Himself
to zero in on a proud heart.  If anyone does not really want to submit
themselves to God and His Word and want to continue with their own beliefs and
ideas, then God has really designed this for that purpose.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Hebrews 9.  This is a verse that many
people like to go to for the purpose of showing that Christ was bearing sin at
the time that He went to the cross and that He did die for sin at that time. 
In Hebrews 9:23, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>It was </i>therefore necessary that the patterns of things in
the heavens should be purified with these&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the blood that Moses would sprinkle. 
God said that &ldquo;almost all things are&hellip;purged with blood.&rdquo;  He said this because
He is so exact and perfect.  Not everything is purged by blood.  There is the
sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost, which is not forgivable.  But &ldquo;almost all
things are&hellip;purged by blood,&rdquo; and God gave the Old Testament sacrificial system
especially to Israel, which was the &ldquo;patterns of things in the heavens&rdquo; that
needed to be purified by the blood of the sacrificial animal.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than
these.  </p>

<p>This is because animal sacrifices cannot take away sin in
any way.  No one&rsquo;s sins are ever pardoned or forgiven due to offering one lamb
or offering one hundred thousand lambs, as Israel sometimes did in their
observances of feasts.  They would slay tremendous numbers of animals according
to the Law and would offer them up to God.  But in the case of every sacrifice
rightly offered, it was actually a picture and an illustration of the Lord
Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who would take away the sins of the world.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 9:24-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <i>which
are </i>the figures of the true&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, &ldquo;figures&rdquo; is like the word &ldquo;patterns.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God
for us: Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth
into the holy place every year with blood of others; For then must he&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Christ:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;must he often have suffered <span class="underline">since</span> the foundation of the
world&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Greek word that was translated &ldquo;since&rdquo; is the same Greek
word that was translated &ldquo;from,&rdquo; as in Christ is &ldquo;the Lamb slain <span class="underline">from</span>
the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  It is the same identical Greek word <i>apo</i>. 
</p>

<p class="verse">For then must he often have suffered [<i>from</i>] the
foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  </p>

<p>Let us think about Hebrews 9:26.  Does it say:  </p>

<p class="verse">For then must he often have suffered [<i>from</i> <i>33 A.D.</i>]&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Does it say this?  If it said this, then anyone who thinks
that Christ was bearing sin on the cross would be right.  But it does not say
this.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For then must he often have suffered [<i>from</i>] the
foundation of the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why go back to the foundation of the world?  Because this is
when He suffered.  Obviously and clearly, He suffered &ldquo;from the foundation of
the world&rdquo; and, therefore, there is no need for Him ever again to suffer, not
in 33 A.D. or at any other time.  He did it &ldquo;once&rdquo; and &ldquo;from the foundation of
the world,&rdquo; which agrees with Revelation 13:8, which agrees with Hebrews 4:3,
which agrees with Romans in that He was &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the Son&rdquo; and as
the Son created the world.  Everything fits.  </p>

<p>Why does Hebrews 9:26 then say:  </p>

<p class="verse">For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the
world: but now once in the end of the world hath he <span class="underline">appeared</span> to put away
sin by the sacrifice of himself.  </p>

<p>This word that was translated &ldquo;appeared&rdquo; is the same word
that is found in 1 Peter 1:20.  We read in 1 Peter 1:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of
the world, but was <span class="underline">manifest</span> in these last times for you,  </p>

<p>God is again referring back to the foundation of the world,
which is when Christ was the Lamb, without spot, without sin.  This is when He
was slain.  But now, once, He has appeared; once, He is being made manifest. 
This is when He entered into the human race and gave the appearance that He was
bearing sins.  </p>

<p>Why did He do this?  Because He is the Light of the world
and the Bible says, &ldquo;for whatsoever doth make <span class="underline">manifest</span>,&rdquo; which is this
same word, &ldquo;is light.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It was already done.  It was already finished.  It was
already completed.  All the sins of His people were paid for and it was
guaranteed that each and every one would become saved as a result, but there
was darkness concerning this.  There was darkness.  </p>

<p>Yes, He gave the Old Testament sacrifices, but more light
needed to be shed.  There needed to be more clarity, and so Christ came into
the world to demonstrate, &ldquo;Here is what this means.  Here is what I have done. 
Here is the work that I have finished.&rdquo;  He then went through His period of
ministry and began to suffer in the garden as He drunk the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath
and went to the cross.  </p>

<p>This was all real.  He truly did suffer.  The only thing is
that He did not have the sins of His people upon Him.  He was not bearing sin
at that time.  Jesus was the Lamb of God from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>Mr. Camping has pointed something out recently.  Turn to
Luke 11:30.  Some people think that there would have been no purpose for Christ
to come into the world just to manifest this.  However, it was God&rsquo;s purpose
that was accomplished.  Notice what it says here in Luke 11:30:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
Son of man be to this generation.  </p>

<p>Jesus was &ldquo;a sign&rdquo; or a tableau.  Some people do not like
this word.  I did not even know what this word meant at first because I had not
heard this too often.  It just means that Christ came to make things manifest,
to reveal, to show, to shed light upon, which is exactly what He did.  </p>

<p>What understanding this has accomplished is that, as this
was nearly impossible before, now it is absolutely impossible for anyone to
claim any part of their salvation.  Man was not even here and there was nothing
as yet in the world when God did it all.  It was all His work and He gets all
the glory.  It is all to the glory of God, as the Bible declares, &ldquo;Mine own arm
brought salvation unto me&rdquo; and, &ldquo;of the people <i>there was </i>none with me.&rdquo; 
This is what the Bible tells us.  </p>

<p>Turn to Isaiah 53.  This is another passage that I have
heard taught on Family Radio recently.  Of course, this is speaking of Christ,
the Messiah, the Lamb of God.  Isaiah 53:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were <i>our </i>faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.  </p>

<p>What is significant about this verse?  It is all in the past
tense, and yet this is seven hundred years before Christ came.  Should it not
read, &ldquo;He will be despised&rdquo;?  Or, &ldquo;He will be rejected&rdquo;?  But it does not say
this.  </p>

<p>Continuing in Isaiah 53:4-7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he <i>was </i>wounded
for our transgressions, <i>he was </i>bruised for our iniquities: the
chastisement of our peace <i>was </i>upon him; and with his stripes we are
healed. </p>

<p>This is all in the past tense.  </p>

<p class="verse">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way; and JEHOVAH hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was
oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as
a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he
openeth not his mouth.  </p>

<p>Here we read of the Lamb of God brought as a silent sheep to
the slaughter from the foundation of the world.  Of course, this was in the
past.  It was in the past in Isaiah&rsquo;s day and in all of the history before it. 
This was when Christ paid for the sins of His people.  </p>

<p>Let us look at the Lamb of God in Biblical history in a
couple of places.  Genesis 22:7-8 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
and he said, Here <i>am </i>I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the
wood: but where <i>is </i>the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My
son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering&hellip;  </p>

<p>God Himself is the Lamb.  Jesus is God.  Jesus is the Lamb. 
We thought this was looking toward the cross, and to some degree it was; but
also, this has already been accomplished.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Exodus 7.  I was looking at the Passover feast
in Exodus 12.  What brought this feast about was God bringing judgments on Egypt
and eventually slaying the firstborn.  I noticed something that is interesting
that pertains to our day, which is something that happened prior to God
bringing these judgments, and they were judgments.  Exodus 7:4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, <i>and </i>my people the children of Israel,
out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.  </p>

<p>He speaks of these plagues as &ldquo;great judgments,&rdquo; and so the
plagues were judgments of God.  Again and again, as God brought a plague, He
would send Moses to Pharaoh in order to warn Pharaoh and then Moses would tell
Pharaoh what was going to happen before it happened.  </p>

<p>We know that there is a Biblical principle involved with
this.  The Bible tells us that &ldquo;the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth
his secret unto his servants the prophets.&rdquo;  We are aware that God followed
this pattern with Noah.  Before the judgment of the flood, God forewarned
Noah.  Before the destruction of Sodom, God came to Abraham and said, &ldquo;Shall I
hide from Abraham that thing which I do?&rdquo;  God did not hide this from Abraham. 
This is why Abraham interceded for the righteous in Sodom, as He gave Abraham
advance information that it was going to be destroyed.  Then God, in the person
of two messengers that are called &ldquo;angels&rdquo; in the KJV, which was God Himself
taking on the appearance of these two men, God went to Sodom and He forewarned
Lot of the destruction of Sodom and basically dragged Lot out of the city by
taking him by the hand.  </p>

<p>So this is the Biblical pattern.  The Lord God will do
nothing until He first forewarns His servants the prophets.  His servants then
share this information with everyone else.  Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of
righteousness.&rdquo;  Lot went to his sons-in-law, and so this is the pattern.  Before
God was going to destroy Nineveh, He sent Jonah to give them a very direct
message, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo; and so there was &ldquo;time
and judgment&rdquo; included in this message.  And before destroying Jericho, God
forewarned Rahab through the spies.  The spies went in.  Rahab had heard the
report, along with the other people of her city, and she feared God.  In hiding
the spies, she requested that she and her family might be spared; and they
were.  </p>

<p>Another encouragement is that God works in families, does He
not?  Who was saved from the flood?  One family.  Who was saved from the
destruction of Sodom?  One family.  Who was saved out of Jericho?  One family. 
</p>

<p>So this is encouraging to us.  We are all members of
families.  This is also encouraging to us who are parents that God did save
some of these men&rsquo;s children and that He spared them.  And in taking a look at
the plagues that the Lord was bringing upon Egypt, we find that in many places
He forewarned them.  </p>

<p>Turn to Exodus 8.  We read in Exodus 8:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
Thus saith JEHOVAH, Let my people go, that they may serve me. And if thou
refuse to let <i>them </i>go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 
</p>

<p>He told them ahead of time.  He told them what He was going
to do, and it was a judgment of God.  </p>

<p>In the same chapter, we read in Exodus 8:21-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
swarms <i>of flies </i>upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,
and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms <i>of
flies, </i>and also the ground whereon they <i>are.</i> And I will sever in
that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms <i>of
flies </i>shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH
in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people and thy
people: to morrow shall this sign be.  </p>

<p>They knew about the swarm of flies prior to God bringing
them.  Pharaoh had a night to think about this.  Of course, we know that his
heart was being hardened and that he was not listening to God.  </p>

<p>Does this sound familiar?  Is it familiar to see where God
is telling people directly, &ldquo;This is what I am going to do&rdquo;?  He is doing this
today, is He not?  May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  What is the condition of many
people&rsquo;s hearts as they are hearing this information?  God&rsquo;s people are going
to be humbled.  God will work this out and they will begin to fear, like the
Ninevites, and the Lord will draw them to Himself.  But many people turn a deaf
ear to this.  </p>

<p>Have you ever read the account of the plagues and thought, &ldquo;Pharaoh,
you were so stupid!  You are so dumb!  You have such a hard head.  Not only do
you have a hard heart, you have such a hard head&rdquo;?  Again and again, God is
showing His power and Pharaoh hardens his heart all the more.  He knows what is
coming.  He knows exactly what is coming.  </p>

<p>Look at Exodus 9:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then JEHOVAH said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
Thus saith JEHOVAH God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
me. For if thou refuse to let <i>them </i>go, and wilt hold them still, Behold,
the hand of JEHOVAH is upon thy cattle which <i>is </i>in the field, upon the
horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: <i>there
shall be </i>a very grievous murrain. And JEHOVAH shall sever between the
cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all <i>that
is </i>the children&rsquo;s of Israel. And JEHOVAH appointed a set time, saying, To morrow
JEHOVAH shall do this thing in the land. And JEHOVAH did that thing on the
morrow&hellip;  </p>

<p>They had time.  They were forewarned.  God always does
this.  As we look in the Bible, we can see that He always does this.  If He
does this with a world of a few million and if He does this with the cities of
the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah and the other two cities that probably had maybe
hundreds of thousands of people in them, if He was so careful and so desirous
to warn the righteous and also to let the sword of His wrath be known to them,
then why would anyone think that God would not follow the same pattern and do
exactly what He has done in these lesser types of Judgment Day and, of course,
warn a people of seven billion in the world of our day of &ldquo;the great day of his
wrath&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>When we read the Bible, it does not make sense to think that
God would give us a verse like Amos 3:7, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely the Lord JEHOVAH will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants the prophets.  </p>

<p>To read of all of this and then to believe that we cannot
know anything about the time of the end, that we cannot know the day and that we
cannot know the hour and that God would leave us in the dark about this, is
unbiblical.  </p>

<p>Well, the world has been in the dark about this according to
God&rsquo;s purpose all throughout history until the time of the end.  Now we are
there and we are no longer in the dark.  God is opening up this information.  </p>

<p>Who opened up this information?  Who opened up the Book? 
The Lamb.  The Lamb!  He prevailed.  He is worthy.  He is the One who took the
seals off of the Book.  </p>

<p>Today we have people all over in the churches and
congregations of the church world praising the Lamb.  They are praising the
Lamb; and yet when they hear that Judgment Day is next year, they stop praising
the Lamb.  </p>

<p>But it is the Lamb who opened the Book to reveal this
information and pinpoint the Day of Judgment to show us God&rsquo;s appointed Day. 
If you read Revelation 5 and 6, it is the Lamb who is taking one seal after
another off of the Book.  </p>

<p>I do not fully know why it is that God emphasizes that it is
the Lamb who does this, but we know that the Lamb was from the foundation of
the world and the Lamb is at the end of the world.  Maybe this is the purpose. 
God knows that it is the time of the end when the seals are taken off and the
Lamb is the One who is doing it.  </p>

<p>As we continue in Exodus 9, let us look at Exodus 9:17-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
not let them go? Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof
even until now. Send therefore now, <i>and </i>gather thy cattle, and all that
thou hast in the field; <i>for upon </i>every man and beast which shall be found
in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
them, and they shall die. He that feared the word of JEHOVAH among the servants
of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: And he that
regarded not the word of JEHOVAH left his servants and his cattle in the field. 

</p>

<p>This applies to us.  We can ask ourselves this question: am
I regarding the Word of the Lord or am I not regarding the Word of the Lord?  God
has said what He is going to do, just like He told Pharaoh; but Pharaoh did not
listen.  Pharaoh did not obey.  He did not humble himself under the mighty hand
of God and submit himself to the power of God.  He instead dismissed it, but
how could he dismiss it when all of the other previous judgments had come to
pass?  </p>

<p>This really shows us the nature of man.  They do not want to
hear from God.  They certainly do not want to obey Him.  They do not want to be
humbled before Him.  They hear these things.  The information about Judgment
Day is coming exclusively from the Bible.  It is coming only from the Bible,
which is the Word of God.  Just as God spoke to Moses or just as God spoke to
Noah, so He is speaking through His Word today to His people and to all people,
&ldquo;Will you not regard the Word of the Lord?  Will you not fear before Him?  Will
you not humble yourself and begin to cry unto Him for mercy?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you regard the Word of the Lord, you will.  If you have
no regard for the Word of the Lord, you have much more in common with Pharaoh
than you would like to admit.  If you will not regard the Word of the Lord, you
can picture yourself as these Egyptians who left their cattle in the field and
who had no intention of submitting themselves; and yet, again, the plague came
according to the Word of the Lord.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s Word is true and faithful and dependable and steadfast
and sure.  It is going to be fulfilled on every account.  The promises of God
are always fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Let us also look at Exodus 10.  We read in Exodus 10:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will
I bring the locusts into thy coast:  </p>

<p>And Pharaoh failed to listen again.  </p>

<p>Go to Exodus 12.  God now has one last plague or judgment to
bring, the death of the firstborn.  It says in Exodus 12:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And thus shall ye eat it&hellip;  </p>

<p>I need to explain that God is instituting the Passover.  He
is giving commands regarding the Passover.  </p>

<p>We read in verse 5, Exodus 12:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
shall take <i>it </i>out from the sheep, or from the goats:  </p>

<p>Exodus 12:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they shall take of the blood, and strike <i>it </i>on the
two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat
it.  </p>

<p>Exodus 12:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And thus shall ye eat it; <i>with </i>your loins girded, your
shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste&hellip; 
</p>

<p>If you remember, Jesus said that we must eat of His body and
drink of His blood.  We have to eat of the Bread of Life.  This is the same
idea here as Jesus is &ldquo;the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo; 
He is the Passover Himself, and this feast has everything to do with Christ. 
This is why when He went to the cross in 33 A.D., it was at the time of the
Passover.  God was fulfilling the purpose and the spiritual meaning of this
feast, which looked to the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>Today, too, there is great urgency for man to eat of the
Passover in haste, because time is short.  Has anyone noticed how rapidly time
has gone?  Does anyone remember when we were here in this same place when we had
four years to go?  Then we had three years to go.  Then two years.  How much
time do we have left?  Not much.  This is the last summer that we are
approaching.  There will be a summer in 2011, but it will be after Judgment
Day.  It will be after God has taken His people to Heaven and after the Day of
Salvation is over.  This is the last summer, the last summer season wherein
salvation is possible.  Then we will have another fall and another winter,
which we just came out of and was kind of harsh.  But it will be the last
winter and then we will have spring.  In the spring, it will come.  It will
come in the spring of next year.  </p>

<p>It will come, but maybe I or a few of us will no longer be
alive because the Lord could take us at any time.  But this Day will come.  It
is His appointed Day.  God will work out His salvation plan.  He will save the
last of His elect, and then there will no longer be any purpose for this world
except to experience five months of torment and tremendous sorrow and grief,
knowing that God has already taken His people out of the world.  </p>

<p>This is one reason why God says here in Exodus 12:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye shall eat it in haste: it <i>is </i>JEHOVAH&rsquo;S Passover.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Exodus 12:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against
all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>God is using the Passover and the departure of Israel from Egypt
as a picture, on one account, of Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Long before this time, He had already said to Abraham in
Genesis 15:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land <i>that is </i>not theirs, and shall serve them; and they
shall afflict them four hundred years; And also that nation, whom they shall
serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.  </p>

<p>This is a picture of the end of the world.  God is going to
judge the world.  His people will come out of the world with great spoil and
with great substance, because God will give us a new heaven and a new earth and
everlasting life.  </p>

<p>This is why He promises that &ldquo;the meek shall inherit the
earth.&rdquo;  We will receive the inheritance, not unsaved man who is using up his
inheritance at this time during these days because his treasure was not in Heaven. 
His treasure was on earth, and so Christ is coming as a thief to rob him of his
treasure because a thief &ldquo;cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy,&rdquo; which is nothing but negative, negative, negative.  A thief never
comes to bring blessings.  A thief is not going to come to someone to bring
them to Heaven and give them the reward of eternal life.  A thief does not do
this.  </p>

<p>If anyone thinks that Christ is coming as a thief for them,
and by this they mean that we cannot know and that we remain in the dark, then
He may be coming for them as a thief because they do not know anything about
His coming.  This means that He is not coming to bless you in any way or to
give you any kind of benefit.  He is coming to kill you, to destroy you, and to
steal your treasure that you stored up on earth rather than in Heaven.  </p>

<p>This is why He is coming as a thief.  He will take
everything away and leave you even without a covering, as it says in Revelation
16.  We read in Revelation 16:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is </i>he that watcheth,
and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  </p>

<p>So Christ is coming as a thief to take the manmade covering
that people put on themselves to cover up their sins, things that the churches
have developed with their manmade gospels that they use to indicate that
someone&rsquo;s sins are covered and that they are no longer &ldquo;naked and opened unto
the eyes of him with whom we have to do.&rdquo;  Yet Jesus is saying, &ldquo;I am coming as
a thief and your foundation will be discovered and the covering that you
received whenever as you accepted Christ is worthless.  I am going to take your
covering from you and you will stand before Me spiritually naked and experience
shame for five months.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the reason why God&rsquo;s people realize and know from
the Bible that Jesus is not coming as a thief for them.  You can ask someone
about this, &ldquo;Do you really think that He is coming as a thief for you?  If so,
then He is coming to kill you.  He is coming to destroy you.&rdquo;  But He is not
coming as a thief for the child of God, as 1 Thessalonians 5:4 indicates:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief.  </p>

<p>He is not coming as a thief for His people at all.  </p>

<p>Returning to God speaking to Abraham in Genesis 15, He is
telling him that His people will be afflicted for 400 years.  Israel was in Egypt
for 430 years, from 1877 B.C. until 1447 B.C., but they were not afflicted all
430 years.  This is really very simple to harmonize.  Joseph was in power. 
There was a honeymoon period between him and his family and the Egyptians.  He
was at the right hand of Pharaoh and had done incredible things.  He had
interpreted Pharaoh&rsquo;s dream, which worked out wonderfully for Egypt and
Pharaoh.  Pharaoh had his entire kingdom strengthen through this to where Egypt
was probably the greatest nation on earth in that day due to being able to
gather all things during that famine.  So for the first 30 years&mdash;probably until
the Pharaoh passed away or for however long it was until Joseph was no longer in
power&mdash;they were not afflicted.  However, following this for a period of 400
years, they were.  This does not mean that they were slaves for 400 years.  It
probably started slowly to where they became more and more outsiders, until
finally at one point, Egypt did enslave them and they were put under hard
bondage.  Those in authority were cruel taskmasters over them.  </p>

<p>So the time comes when God speaks of judging this nation and
His people coming out with great substance, and then He says in Genesis 15:16: 
</p>

<p class="verse">But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
the iniquity of the Amorites <i>is </i>not yet full.  </p>

<p>We know through the Biblical calendar of history who these
four generations are referring to as they went into Egypt: Levi, Kohath, Amram,
and Aaron.  When we put all of these generations together, it totals 430
years.  It is a little involved knowing how old Levi was when he went into Egypt,
but all of the other ages are known.  </p>

<p>So God shows definitely that it was a 430-year period to the
very day.  He says this in Exodus 12:40-41:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
<i>was </i>four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the
four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all
the hosts of JEHOVAH went out from the land of Egypt.  </p>

<p>So God has this in mind for quite awhile.  He knew that He
was going to do this.  This was the appointed day of deliverance.  This was the
appointed day of judgment on the Egyptians, as all of the firstborn were
slain.  Then He tells them in advance.  He tells them in advance what He is
going to do.  He is going to bring His people out.  At the same time, He is
going to bring wrath and His judgment on Egypt, and it had to be precisely on
that day and on no other day.  It was &ldquo;the selfsame day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is how exact and perfect God is and how He works out
His Biblical calendar of history to the day, and so we have May 21, 2011.  It will not be any other day; it will be that day.  This is because it is the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day of the Great Tribulation.  It is not 8399.  It is not 8401.  It is the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day, a full 23-year period.  It is also 7,000 years from the flood.  Plus, what
is May 21, 2011 in the Hebrew calendar?  It is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

month, which agrees with the day that God shut Noah and his family into the
ark.  Therefore, He could not have this land on May 22<sup>nd</sup>, nor could
He have it on May 20<sup>th</sup>.  It had to be May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>If you go to a Hebrew calendar website [<i>note:</i> <a
href="http://www.hebcal.com/converter/">http://www.hebcal.com/converter/</a>  <i>for
example</i>] and you type in &ldquo;May 21, 2011,&rdquo; you will see that it is the 17<sup>th</sup>

day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hebrew month of Iyyar.  If you type in &ldquo;May 21, 2005 or 2010 or 2015,&rdquo; it does not come up.  I went from a 20-year span of 2000 to
2020, and there is only one year when May 21 is this particular Hebrew day,
which agrees with the day that God shut Noah into the ark.  For this and many
other reasons, this must be the day; and God is again following the pattern of
forewarning His people.  </p>

<p>Let us now read Exodus 12:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where
ye <i>are: </i>and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
shall not be upon you to destroy <i>you, </i>when I smite the land of Egypt.  </p>

<p>So the question is: do we have blood on the doorposts of our
house?  Not literal blood, but do we have the blood of Christ covering our
house or covering us as individuals?  Is it covering our children?  Is it
covering others in our family?  </p>

<p>Remember that this is referring to the night of &ldquo;the
destroyer.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The destroyer&rdquo; went through the land of Egypt, house to house. 
Where there was not the blood, He destroyed.  He killed the firstborn, from
Pharaoh who sat upon the throne, to a prisoner in the dungeon.  </p>

<p>It does not matter who you are.  &ldquo;God is no respecter of
persons.&rdquo;  He is only looking to see, &ldquo;Are you covered by the blood or are you
not covered by the blood?&rdquo;  It could be that some are not covered by the blood,
and yet we have time because it is still the day of salvation.  </p>

<p>But there is one thing that is very necessary, which is that
the Word of the Lord be regarded, that it be heeded, that it be listened to,
that it be believed.  If you regard not the Word of the Lord, then you are in
company with the Egyptians.  </p>

<p>We see finally when it was all over that God had devastated Egypt. 
The army of Pharaoh and Pharaoh himself died in the Red Sea.  Their crops were
ruined.  Their animals were dead.  All of their firstborn were slain, and yet Israel
marched out triumphantly.  They marched out gloriously.  </p>

<p>Of course, we know that they were not all saved.  Most of
them were not saved, but God was using this as a picture to illustrate what He
is going to do next year as His people will be saved.  </p>

<p>Let us just look at a couple of last verses.  We saw the
Lamb from the foundation of the world.  We read of the lamb in the history of Israel
and the Passover feast.  We know that Jesus was &ldquo;the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world,&rdquo; who came and made what He had done manifest in the
first century A.D.  We know that it is the Lamb who opened up the Book, the
Bible, and who is revealing all of these truths to us and giving us all of this
information.  </p>

<p>If people have a problem with this, it is not Family Radio
that they have a problem with.  It is not any individual whom they have a
problem with.  They have a problem with the Lamb, because God is the One who is
taking the seals off the Book.  </p>

<p>We find in Revelation 21:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb <i>is </i>the
light thereof.  </p>

<p>Then verse 27, Revelation 21:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth, neither <i>whatsoever </i>worketh abomination, or <i>maketh </i>a
lie: but they which are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.  </p>

<p>May each of our names be written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of
Life.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
