<p>If everyone could turn to Genesis 25, I am going to begin
reading in verse 19.  Genesis 25:19-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And these <i>are </i>the generations of Isaac, Abraham&rsquo;s son:
Abraham begat Isaac: And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to
wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the
Syrian. And Isaac entreated JEHOVAH for his wife, because she <i>was </i>barren:
and JEHOVAH was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. And the
children struggled together within her; and she said, If <i>it be </i>so, why <i>am
</i>I thus? And she went to inquire of JEHOVAH. And JEHOVAH said unto her, Two
nations <i>are </i>in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated
from thy bowels; and <i>the one </i>people shall be stronger than <i>the other </i>people;
and the elder shall serve the younger. And when her days to be delivered were
fulfilled, behold, <i>there were </i>twins in her womb. And the first came out
red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. And after
that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&rsquo;s heel; and his name
was called Jacob: and Isaac <i>was </i>threescore years old when she bare them.
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob

<i>was </i>a plain man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did
eat of <i>his </i>venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.  </p>

<p>I will stop here, but we will pick up a little later in
verse 29.  </p>

<p>We have here the account of Isaac and his wife Rebekah
giving birth to twin sons: Esau and Jacob.  God mentions both of these men
often in the Bible.  He also often uses them as types and figures in the
Bible.  </p>

<p>But before we get into this, I just want to point out that
even though it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Isaac loved Esau&hellip;but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<p>I do not think that this means that they did not love their
other son, not necessarily.  Maybe Esau had a special place in his father Isaac&rsquo;s
heart because they maybe had a little bit more in common, but I am sure that
this does not mean that Isaac hated Jacob.  And I am sure that because Rebekah
loved Jacob, this does not mean that she hated her other son Esau.  I do not
think that God is saying that here.  It is just that each one took a particular
or maybe a little bit more liking or had more affection to the one son.  </p>

<p>We can understand why Rebekah would feel a little bit closer
to Jacob since God had told her the reason for the struggle that was going on within
her womb, &ldquo;Two nations <i>are </i>in thy womb&hellip;and the elder shall serve the
younger.&rdquo;  God specifically told Rebekah this, and so she had in her mind that
Jacob held a more special place with God than Esau.  It then developed in her
life, too, that she would look on Jacob a little bit differently.  </p>

<p>As far as Isaac is concerned, let us go to Hebrews 11 where
we will find a verse that tells us all that we really need to know about his
feelings for both of his sons.  In Hebrews 11:20, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob <span class="underline">and</span> Esau concerning things
to come.  </p>

<p>He was not partial.  He was not showing favoritism.  He
blessed both of them with the Gospel, with the Word of God.  He did this
because God had given him information, the Scripture, to some degree, and he
shared this with his sons.  They were, therefore, both blessed.  </p>

<p>This is a significant statement that God is making here
because we know that Esau was never saved.  God, however, tells us that he was
blessed.  He was blessed because he heard the Gospel, which warned him about
things to come as well as all of the other information that God gives about
eternal life and salvation.  As far as all of this information, both sons were
blessed.  </p>

<p>This is also good instruction for any parent to bring the
Gospel to all of the children.  Whether they show some interest in the Bible or
no interest in the Bible, we are to equally share God&rsquo;s Word with them; and
this is a blessing.  Whether they realize it or not, this is a blessing that
they are being warned, that they are hearing the whole counsel of God, that
there is a potential, from our perspective, that the Lord could save any of
them.  </p>

<p>If we look at our children, yes, maybe they give us some
indicators at this time as to whether or not they are saved, because we find
that they are not listening many times to the Gospel as we share with them.  We
can also find that some seem very much interested and are maybe even afraid of
some of the things that are coming out of the Bible at this time, and this is a
good thing and a healthy thing.  But still, we just share equally with them
all, and then we leave it up to God because we do not know in our own family
who is Jacob and who is Esau.  I say this because God uses these two brothers,
twin brothers&mdash;which is about as close as you can get to another person&mdash;to
typify the saved and the unsaved.  </p>

<p>In Malachi 1:1-4, the Lord writes:  </p>

<p class="verse">The burden of the word of JEHOVAH to Israel by Malachi. I have
loved you, saith JEHOVAH&hellip;</p>

<p>By the way, &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; was also Jacob&rsquo;s name.  God changed his
name from Jacob to Israel as an indicator that he would be a prince with God
and that he had God&rsquo;s blessing.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have loved you, saith JEHOVAH. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
loved us? <i>Was </i>not Esau Jacob&rsquo;s brother? saith JEHOVAH: yet I loved
Jacob, And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the
dragons of the wilderness. Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will
return and build the desolate places; thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts, They shall
build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of
wickedness, and, The people against whom JEHOVAH hath indignation for ever.  </p>

<p>God uses Esau many times to typify the churches and the
congregations and those who are unsaved within them.  He uses Jacob oftentimes
to typify His chosen people, His elect people, those whom He had predestinated
to salvation from before the foundation of the world.  God sets this up by
saying that He loves Jacob and that He hates Esau.  </p>

<p>With this, we find immediately that the teaching that is so
widespread today in the church world&mdash;which is that God loves you and has a
wonderful plan for your life&mdash;is wrong, or that God loves everyone, that God
loves all people.  They say this based on a misunderstanding of John 3:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">For God so loved the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Well okay, so God loves the world, but that means that He
must love everybody but Esau.  Does God love everybody but Esau?  No, no.  Why
would He particularly say that He hated Esau?  Other people have done far worse
than Esau ever did in his life.  God is using Esau as a figure and a type of
all of the unsaved people of the world.  God hates you.  I know how horrible
this sounds, but the Bible says that God hates you.  </p>

<p>He does not hate you in such a way that He would not send
the rain upon you, because He &ldquo;sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.&rdquo;  He
has many temporal blessings and good gifts that He gives to men and the
children of men.  He gives them good health at times and life and breath.  Any
good thing that one can think of in their life comes from God; it all can be
traced back to God.  </p>

<p>However, where it is most important is that the love that He
has on Jacob is an everlasting love.  It is the eternal love of salvation, of
giving Jacob and His elect people eternal life, and He gave this to Jacob but
He did not give this to Esau.  He passed him by.  He left Esau in his sins and
all of those like him.  In sin, we are under God&rsquo;s wrath.  He is angry with us
and He is going to destroy us.  </p>

<p>If we go to Psalm 11, we find a verse that you really do not
hear much taught in the pulpits of the churches.  It says in Psalm 11:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth.  </p>

<p>Just like Esau, except now God is expanding it.  He is
indicating all of the unrighteous.  He tries the righteous.  He does not try
the unrighteous, the wicked people.  Instead, He hates them.  </p>

<p>We would have to say, yes, we can see why, because God, in
His fury and in His anger, is going to bring judgment on May 21 in 2011.  At
that time, He will bring about the torment of all of the wicked of the world
for five months.  Then on October 21 in 2011, He is going to burn up the world
and the universe and all of the unsaved people.  </p>

<p>This is not an act of love.  This is an act of wrath.  Why
is God wrathful?  He is a God of wrath because anger has been kindled in Him
due to man&rsquo;s sin, due to people&rsquo;s transgressions of the Law of God.  Therefore,
God will judge them and He will destroy man.  Man will perish because of this. 
</p>

<p>Let us also go to Romans 9.  As we look at Jacob and Esau,
we wonder why God made this choice.  Why did He elect Jacob to salvation and
why did He just leave Esau as he was, under His wrath?  What is the reason? 
What did Jacob do right?  What did Esau do wrong?  What is the answer to this? 
God answers this in Romans 9 where we read in Romans 9:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And not only <i>this; </i>but when Rebecca also had conceived by
one, <i>even </i>by our father Isaac; (For <i>the children </i>being not yet
born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according
to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) It was said
unto her, The elder [<i>Esau</i>] shall serve the younger [<i>Jacob</i>]. As it
is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  </p>

<p>We can see that what the Lord is saying is that this choice
was made before they were born.  </p>

<p>We can also look elsewhere, like in Ephesians 1, which says
that this choice was made &ldquo;before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  This is when Christ
died.  He was &ldquo;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  The Bible
also tells us that &ldquo;the works were finished from the foundation of the world&rdquo;
that were necessary in salvation.  All of the sins of His elect people,
typified by Jacob, were placed upon Him at that time, before this world even
began.  He suffered and died as the Lamb of God and made payment for all of the
sins of His people before He even spoke to create this world and this
universe.  </p>

<p>In discussing His choice in salvation, the Lord is using an
example of twins, and you cannot get any closer than that.  Yes, husband and
wife are close; but as far as people being alike, twins are about as close as
you can get because they are alike in appearance, they are alike in speech
sometimes, and they are alike in actions oftentimes.  Sometimes they can be
very different, but twins are even practically born at the same time.  Esau
came out first, and then Jacob, grabbing Esau&rsquo;s heel, came out second.  We are
not told exactly how long apart the births were, but they were probably pretty
close together.  They were very similar.  </p>

<p>Also, they were newborn babies and neither had yet done
anything good or anything bad in action.  They had not sinned outwardly as yet,
even though God tells us in the Psalms in reference to men, &ldquo;They go astray as
soon as they be born,&rdquo; and that they are born &ldquo;speaking lies.&rdquo;  And He is
looking there at the heart of man because babies do not speak.  Right?  They
can make a few sounds, but a baby will not speak for quite awhile after birth. 
And yet God says, &ldquo;as soon as they be born,&rdquo; they are born &ldquo;speaking lies.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why does He say it this way?  He says this because of what
we read in another Psalm.  It says in Psalm 14:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">The fool hath said in his heart, <i>There is </i>no God&hellip;  </p>

<p>When does the fool make this statement and who is a fool?  A
fool is any unsaved person, so this applies to them as soon as they be born or
as soon as they become an individual in the womb.  They have a heart.  God has
given them a soul.  In that heart of unbelief, a heart of stone that they have
right away, they are already speaking.  Evil is already flowing out of it in
rebellion against God as they believe that there is no God.  </p>

<p>As children grow, you begin to see this sin nature and that
they do lie.  As soon as they are caught doing something, they lie.  If you ask
them if they did that, they lie and point to their brother or sister when they
really did do it.  They do this because they are a liar.  </p>

<p>This is what the Bible says about us.  It is not very
positive and it is not something that we would like to admit, but the Bible
says that all men are liars, &ldquo;Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar.&rdquo;  We
are all liars, naturally-born liars.  This comes out often in our life.  God is
the only One who is true.  His Word is true and faithful, but no man is.  </p>

<p>So before they had done any good or evil of themselves in
any action, they were already sinners.  They were already under the wrath of
God from the time that they were in their mother&rsquo;s womb, because sinners beget
sinners and the Bible tells us, &ldquo;Who can bring a clean <i>thing </i>out of an
unclean?&rdquo;  Before they had done any good or evil, God made a selection&mdash;and He
chose Jacob.  He did not choose him because he was more obedient.  He did not
choose him because he was more faithful.  He did not choose him because he was
good looking.  He did not choose him because he was charming.  He did not
choose him because of anything in this world.  The only thing that the Bible
tells us in regards to God&rsquo;s choice in saving people is that it is &ldquo;according
to the good pleasure of his will.&rdquo;  He is a merciful God and He decided that
Jacob would be one of His elect, but not Esau.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s privilege.  He is God and King.  As King, if
He has a million rebels in a dungeon and He decides to pardon one based on His
own good pleasure, then that is His right to do so.  It is His right to do
this.  No one can say that this would be a wrong thing to do.  No one could say
that He is being unjust or unfair.  </p>

<p>God says this in the following verse of Romans 9.  We read
in Romans 9:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">What shall we say then? <i>Is there </i>unrighteousness with
God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  </p>

<p>This is His sovereign right, is it not?  The only thing that
someone could say to try to accuse God and to try to make it seem that He is
being unfair and unjust is, &ldquo;I deserve to be chosen.  I deserve for You to
choose me.  I deserve for You to elect me to salvation.  I deserve to be saved.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Do we?  Does anyone?  Absolutely not!  We all deserve death,
&ldquo;For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death.&rdquo;  We are all sinners and we all deserve
to die and to perish.  We deserve whatever God&rsquo;s justice deems necessary in
payment for sin.  Whatever God&rsquo;s Word says that the punishment for sin is, that
is what we deserve.  </p>

<p>I can use an example that I have used in the past of the
fallen angels.  The fallen angels rebelled against God and they sinned.  Did
God make any provision for salvation for any of the fallen angels?  Not even
one?  Well, is that not fair?  Who says that this is not fair?  Who says that
it is not fair that God did not provide any means of salvation for Satan and
the demons?  God did not die for any of them.  He did not take their sins upon
Himself.  Is anyone going to say that He was not being fair or that He was not
being just?  Who says that?  </p>

<p>No one says that!  Who cares about the devil and the fallen
angels!  Why do we not care?  Why do we think that they are getting their just
desserts and that it is a righteous act of God to destroy them forevermore?  Why
do we think this?  We think this because of what they did.  We see their sin. 
We see how evil it was for Satan to tempt man and to get man to fall into sin
and all those who were with him.  It is a just thing that we really feel when
we say, &ldquo;Let God destroy them forever!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But we are just as sinful.  We are just as rebellious
against God.  If we could step back away from ourselves, we would see that if
it is just for God to destroy the fallen angels, it is also just for Him to
destroy every single human being in the same manner.  Actually, no one could
complain and no one would have the right to say that this would be unjust.  This
would be very just, and yet God in His mercy and in His love and in His grace
decided to save some, perhaps as many as 200 million people out of the whole sum
of mankind.  He mercifully took their sins upon Himself and paid for those sins
and redeemed those people in such a way that we can only say that God is a
great God of love and mercy, even though He does reserve the right to have
mercy upon whom He will have mercy.  </p>

<p>Therefore, as we know that time is short and that the Day of
Judgment is near, none of us should go to God pleading our own merits, pleading
that we deserve anything, pleading that He should save us.  Maybe we do not say
this with our own words to Him because we are wiser than that&mdash;we are a little
bit smarter than that because we hear these things&mdash;but maybe in our hearts and
in our actions, after we have besought the Lord and He did not answer after one
minute, we get up and we are in a little bit of a snit that God did not hear us,
as though He should have, as though He was obligated to, as though He must have
mercy on us!  </p>

<p>You see, that is not a humble approach to God.  We really
have to recognize that we are the condemned criminal and that we are guilty,
that we are in the dungeon and that there is only one way out, only one way of
salvation, which is through the great love of God through Christ, and that it
is possible, because we do not know whom God saved or did not save, that we
might be one of those elect, that we might be like Jacob.  </p>

<p>So we can go to God very humbly, like a prisoner.  Even
today prisoners on death row are permitted to write a letter to their
governor.  What do you think would happen if the governor was to get a letter
from a prisoner who said, &ldquo;Look, I have been on death row awhile now.  This is
my tenth request for a pardon and you have not answered me!  But you must
pardon me!  You must!&rdquo;?  Well, the governor would throw that letter into the
trash.  </p>

<p>But is this the way that we are to approach someone who has
the power and authority to set you free, to deliver you?  In earthly terms,
would anyone dare do that who had any common sense and understanding of the way
that this system in this world operates?   </p>

<p>No, most prisoners are smarter than this.  They write a very
humble letter, &ldquo;I see my wrongs.  I know that what I did was not right and I
have cried a thousand tears over it.  If it could be, if it might be, governor
or president or whoever, please pardon me.  Do this only because I have heard
that you are a merciful governor.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You see, this letter may also be refused, but at least the
governor would read this.  He would not just rip it up right away.  He would
take a look at that letter and possibly consider it.  And we know that God is
gracious and merciful.  This is why we &ldquo;come boldly unto the throne of grace,
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 25.  I will start reading in verse
29.  Genesis 25:29-30 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he <i>was
</i>faint: And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <i>pottage;
</i>for I <i>am </i>faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  </p>

<p>In the Bible, the Edomites or the descendants of Esau have
several names.  For example, they are called Edom, Bozrah, Mount Seir or the children
of Mount Seir.  God gives them several names.  These names normally represent
the unsaved people in the corporate churches.  </p>

<p>I will read verse 30 again.  It continues in Genesis
25:30-34:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
<i>pottage; </i>for I <i>am </i>faint: therefore was his name called Edom. And
Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I <i>am </i>at
the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And Jacob
said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright
unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat
and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised <i>his </i>birthright. 
</p>

<p>I will stop reading there.</p>

<p>Have you ever made a bad deal in your life, a bad
transaction?  Have you ever been almost swindled in a deal?  How about those of
us who have bought used cars: have you ever gotten a really bad used car?  I
have and it does not feel good when you have exchanged something of greater
value than what you get back.  </p>

<p>I remember on the tract trip to Brazil, I had American
dollars but I needed some Brazilian money.  There was a place right where I was
that was very convenient, and so I made the exchange.  Then a little later on,
I saw another place that was giving a much better exchange rate and I felt like
I had gotten gypped.  I had this nagging feeling that I had gotten gypped.  </p>

<p>Now, that was on a small scale, and yet I think that this
has happened to most of us with certain things in life.  We also know from
history that some American Indians had sold Manhattan to settlers.  An
estimation of how much they had sold it for would be about twenty-four
dollars.  It is, of course, worth a lot more today, but they sold it for
trinkets that they estimate were worth about twenty-four dollars.  </p>

<p>You see, one thing that happens in transactions with people
who wind up getting cheated is that they sometimes fail to consider the future
concerning these kinds of transactions.  As the Indians looked around at Manhattan
at that time, all they saw were a bunch of trees and grass.  They could not see
anything that was really worth anything.  They hunted and they fished and they
were not really landowners anyway, plus it would not be until the future when
developments began to take over that Manhattan would become a very big piece of
real estate in the United States.  </p>

<p>There was also another transaction between the American
government and Russia in the nineteenth century over Alaska.  At the time that America
bought Alaska for 7.2 million dollars, which we would have to say was a lot of money
for that day, the newspaper writers thought that we had gotten the bad end of
the deal.  The man who engineered this deal was named Seward and they called it
&ldquo;Seward&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; because he bought a frozen wilderness for 7.2 million
dollars.  Well, Alaska is worth trillions of dollars today.  </p>

<p>The issue is the future.  The purchase at that time did not
look too good, but there was a future time when the value of that transaction,
of that exchange, really increased incredibly.  Everyone could then see what a
wise thing it was for America to have purchased the territory of Alaska, which
became one of our states.  </p>

<p>In the Bible, God also speaks of you and me in a way that is
like a transaction, as far as salvation is concerned.  For instance, if we go
to Matthew 16:24, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any <i>man </i>will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>

<p>Let us just think about this for a second because God does
not hide from us the truth about the Christian life.  Taking up one&rsquo;s cross is
not a pleasant thing.  It is really an affliction to take up the cross.  We are
afflicted.  The Bible tells us, &ldquo;In the world ye shall have tribulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;that
we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo;  We are going
to be looked down upon and despised and lowly.  In the world&rsquo;s eyes, we will be
as nothing.  This is how the world views someone who brings the Gospel
message.  </p>

<p>So God is saying that this is the situation.  If we follow
Him, as He has stated many times in other places in the Bible, there is eternal
life, eternal joy, eternal happiness, eternal peace, for ever and ever and
ever, into eternity future: tremendous and abundant blessings that are beyond
our ability to understand in the least.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, in this life, you are going to have
trouble.  It is not going to be easy.  You are not going to be loved.  As a
matter of fact, the more you abundantly love, the less you will be loved.  </p>

<p>Jesus is pointing this out and being straightforward in
Matthew 16:24.  Then in Matthew 16:25-26, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in
exchange for his soul?  </p>

<p>Here is the deal.  Here is the trade.  This is the bargain,
or is it?  You see, this is how our life is like a transaction, much like we
find with Esau who had the birthright.  It was his.  He was the firstborn and
the firstborn was to receive a double portion of the inheritance.  </p>

<p>So, yes, having that inheritance sounds good, and yet Esau
was starving.  He was just starving and that soup smelled good, &ldquo;That soup
smells good and my conniving brother will give me a bowl if I give him my
birthright.&rdquo;  Who knows; maybe he even made a joke of it.  We do not know what
his mindset was.  We only know that Esau agreed, &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; because to him it
was not of much value.  </p>

<p>It is the same when God says to follow Him and to take up
our cross and that the child of God is saved and has life eternal.  We can see
now, at this point, that this does not appear too valuable in the eyes of the
world.  They cannot see it.  They cannot measure it.  They cannot prove it. 
Therefore, it is lowly and esteemed.  It is not given too much weight at all. 
But the things that the world can see&mdash;the things that we can feel and touch and
sense in this world&mdash;are given much more weight, even if it is just a bowl of
soup, even if it is just a bowl of porridge.  Yet God tells us that in this
exchange, we could even have the whole world, not just a bowl of soup, but the
entire world, the whole world.  </p>

<p>Would you not like to be a billionaire?  Who would not mind
having billions of dollars?  Most people look at billionaires and they just
feel a sense of desire, &ldquo;I would like to have all that.  I would like to have
all of that money!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, what God has done is that He has told us in many
places that we are not to desire the things of the earth, the things of this
world.  No, you are to &ldquo;set your affection on things above, not on things on
the earth.&rdquo;  We are to desire eternal life.  </p>

<p>When most people are asked if they would desire to be like
some billionaire and have all of those houses and jet planes and the respect
and honor of the world, they really would long for this; that is until that
same billionaire woke up one morning and hopped out of bed, tripped over a
shoelace that he forgot to tie, tumbled down the steps and lay at the bottom
with a broken neck.  Of course, they rush him to the hospital.  They know that
he is one of the richest men of the world, and so they give him the best care
possible.  However, he just cannot survive, and so the doctors give him a day
or two to live.  </p>

<p>Who would want to be in his shoes then?  Would you want to
be that billionaire then?  He still has all that money.  He still has the
clothes.  He still has the jets and all the things that are his.  Everything is
still his, but would you want to place yourself in his shoes when he is lying
in a hospital bed with about 48 hours to live?  </p>

<p>No, you would not.  Why not?  Because you understand that in
48 hours he is going to die and that whatever he has and whatever possessions
he owns will be gone.  He cannot take them with him.  He cannot enjoy them any
longer.  They are removed from him forever.  </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in the day that he dies, the Bible
tells us, &ldquo;in that very day his thoughts perish.&rdquo;  He lost his soul.  It was a
dead soul, but now it is gone forever because it ceases to be.  It is an &ldquo;everlasting
destruction,&rdquo; and that billionaire now knows nothing of his life.  He now knows
nothing of his memories.  What he accumulated in wealth and in riches is all
gone.  He now knows nothing of them and everything will now go to others, just
like Solomon says, &ldquo;And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <i>man </i>or a
fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So where is the billionaire the better?  When we know that a
man like this is also going to die, we realize that money and valuables and the
things of this world are not important.  The only important thing is a
relationship with God, to have our soul.  Our soul is valuable.  It is very
valuable, is it not?  Do you really believe this?  </p>

<p>Let us go to Proverbs 20 where we will find an interesting
verse that I was thinking about.  Let us see if you can see what I am seeing
here.  This is a proverb of Solomon, as God moved Solomon to write this.  In
Proverbs 20:14, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>It is </i>naught, <i>it is </i>naught, saith the buyer&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught&rdquo; means &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;  The buyer is saying, &ldquo;It is
nothing!&rdquo;  By saying this, he is lowering the value of what you want to sell to
him.  &ldquo;It means nothing to me.  Who is going to even want something like this? 
How am I going to make any profit on something like that?  It is nothing,
nothing, nothing,&rdquo; saith the buyer.  </p>

<p>However, then notice what it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.  </p>

<p>This is because he tricked you.  He got the better part of
the deal.  He put down in your eyes as low as he could whatever it was that you
were selling because he wanted to make more money on it.  He knew the worth of
it; and so through his bartering, he got you to practically give it away for
nothing.  Then when he goes his way, he starts boasting and rejoicing.  </p>

<p>Have you ever been on the good part of a deal where you sold
something and got much more in return than it was really worth?  Most of us
have and we do tend to tell others about it.  We tend to share when we just got
a really good deal on something.  </p>

<p>That is what this is, but who is this buyer?  And is this
buyer being truthful?  Is he being honest?  No, he is deceitful and a liar.  He
is a liar, is he not?  He knows the value of what you want to sell, but he is
saying that it is worthless and that it is nothing.  He is a liar who wants to
purchase something from you and he is willing to lie to get it.  </p>

<p>What did Satan say to Eve in the garden?  Let us go back to
Genesis 3.  We read in Genesis 3:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
which JEHOVAH God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>

<p>First of all, he is trying to bring doubt into the mind of
Eve about the Word of God.</p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 3:2-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which <i>is </i>in the
midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely
die:</p>

<p>That is a lie.  It was an absolute lie!  Jesus called Satan &ldquo;a
liar, and the father of it,&rdquo; because here he was lying to Eve.  </p>

<p>What was Satan going to get out of this by lying?  What was
Satan going to get?  At that point, what would man lose if Eve and Adam sinned? 
What were they going to lose?  They were going to lose their souls.  </p>

<p>There is an exchange going on here.  Satan is lying.  Right
now, they have a wonderful relationship with God, a perfect relationship, a
good relationship, and there is no indication that they would ever die if that
continued.  God, of course, would continue to bless them; but if this
transaction continued&mdash;and it is already at the point of tragedy&mdash;then Eve and
Adam will lose their souls, and Satan is lying to them.  </p>

<p>First of all, we read what Eve says in Genesis 3:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
</p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 3:4-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the
tree <i>was </i>good for food, and that it <i>was </i>pleasant to the eyes, and
a tree to be desired to make <i>one </i>wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  </p>

<p>And they died, spiritually.  They then became subject to the
second death, and it has been all misery ever since.  </p>

<p>Now here we are at the very edge of the end of the world. 
We are now below 500 days left before Judgment Day.  We are at day 497.  In
another week, it will be 490 days left.  In answering one of the disciple&rsquo;s
questions about forgiveness, Jesus said to forgive &ldquo;until seventy times seven.&rdquo; 
This is how long we are to forgive.  Therefore, in literally one week, we will
have 490 days for God&rsquo;s people in this world to actually exercise, by God&rsquo;s
grace, forgiveness to our fellowman.  </p>

<p>In saying this, Jesus was actually referring back to the
book of Daniel and its seventy sevens, which go all the way to the end of the
world.  That is how long Christians are to forgive.  We are to forgive every
day until we are out of this world, until God takes us out of the world.  </p>

<p>Here we are with a few short days remaining and the question
really has to be asked: what are you selling your soul for?  How much are you
going to get?  What is the transaction worth?  What is it?  What are you
getting?  What is it that you just refuse to part with, to turn from, to give
up, to repent of?  What is it?  What sin is it in your life that you think is
worth more than your own eternal&mdash;excuse me, unsaved man&rsquo;s soul is not
eternal&mdash;but more than receiving the gift of God of everlasting life?  What is
worth more than that?  </p>

<p>Some people just think&mdash;well, they do not think; they do not
want to think about it&mdash;but really, how can you think that anything in this
world is more valuable?  It must be that there is a deceiver.  It must be that
there is a deceiver in your life who is convincing you or has convinced you
that what you possess in your soul is worthless, that it has no value, that it
is naught.  &ldquo;It is naught; it is naught,&rdquo; saith the buyer&mdash;and the buyer is a
liar and the buyer is taking you captive at his own will and you are in the
dungeon of sin.  Your own iniquity has you wrapped about like cords, and Satan
is the ruler.  </p>

<p>So here we are approaching this day and some people just
really try to quiet their conscience about the transaction that many people, to
some degree, are aware of that they are making where they are choosing the
world and its pleasures rather than suffer afflictions with the people of God,
as Moses realized when he said, &ldquo;Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
riches than the treasures in Egypt.&rdquo;  Moses saw the worth of the exchange.  But
unsaved man is willing to give up any possibility&mdash;it is not guaranteed&mdash;but any
possibility of salvation and eternal life in exchange for what?  </p>

<p>What did God say in Ezekiel?  He said, &ldquo;For why will ye die?&rdquo; 
He tells us, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,&rdquo; and then He asks
that question, &ldquo;For why will ye die?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You will die for TV, for searching on the computer, for
drinking, for smoking.  What?  What is it?  What is it that will not let go or
that you will not let go of?  </p>

<p>We see with Esau what a great tragedy it was even though he
did not realize it at the time.  He went out from the presence of Jacob and
that empty bowl of pottage feeling just fine.  He was not troubled then.  It
did not bother him.  He made that lousy exchange and gave up his birthright for
a bowl of soup, but it was not until later that he became bothered.  </p>

<p>If you go to Genesis 27, we will not get into this whole
story, but Rebekah encourages Jacob to put on animal fur in order to give the
appearance of being his brother Esau.  Then Jacob goes in and receives the
blessing because Isaac is not able to tell that it was Jacob and not Esau, the
one whom he intended to bless.  It says in Genesis 27:30-38:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac
his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. And he also had
made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father,
Let my father arise, and eat of his son&rsquo;s venison, that thy soul may bless me. And
Isaac his father said unto him, Who <i>art </i>thou? And he said, I <i>am </i>thy
son, thy firstborn Esau. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who?
where <i>is </i>he that hath taken venison, and brought <i>it </i>me, and I
have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, <i>and </i>he
shall be blessed. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, <i>even </i>me
also, O my father. And he said, Thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken
away thy blessing. And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he
hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for
me? And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord,
and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine
have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? And Esau said
unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <i>even </i>me
also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.  </p>

<p>He wept because he was now impacted by the decision that he
had made earlier to sell his birthright.  Now he was losing the blessing of the
firstborn and he was weeping.  </p>

<p>If we go to Hebrews 12:16-17, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Lest there <i>be </i>any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau,
who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that afterward,
when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no
place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  </p>

<p>What can we say?  Esau now realizes what he did not realize
earlier.  </p>

<p>When are the people of the world going to realize that in
exchange for their souls, they received nothing?  They received that which is
worthless.  Anyone who thinks that the American Indians got the bad end of the
deal does not understand just how bad a transaction it is that mankind makes
with their very souls.  </p>

<p>What day will it be when people will realize this?  It will
be on May 21 in 2011 after the door of salvation is shut, which was the only
way to have gotten into Heaven.  There will be no salvation for that five-month
period.  At that time, the people will realize this.  They will not be able to
avoid this fact because they will have witnessed the resurrection of the dead,
earthquakes the world over, and God&rsquo;s people having been raptured who are still
alive at that time.  </p>

<p>At that point, everyone will understand and see with their
physical eyes that the Bible is true, the Word of God is true, and now there is
just terrible heartbreak.  How God puts it is &ldquo;there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;  It will be like the bitter cry of Esau who was blessed &ldquo;concerning
things to come&rdquo; by his own father Isaac.  Isaac informed them both &ldquo;concerning
things to come.&rdquo;  One, by God&rsquo;s grace, entered into Heaven, while the other was
left to cry and weep.  </p>

<p>What a horrible thing it will be for five months for those
who have heard these things and known these things!  They are not going to
forget it on May 21, or for however long they live thereafter.  They are going
to remember.  Just like we can remember things now, they will remember what God
has said and the tracts and all of the preaching.  It is going to be in their
minds, and that will be the biggest cause of torment for those left behind.  </p>

<p>Let us close with a word of prayer.  Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank You for giving us advance information and for letting us know what is
soon to come.  Father, we all have allowed sin into our life easily.  It has
easily beset us.  Father, we pray that You would give us a hatred of sin, an
abhorrence of evil, that we would not be deceived by the lie that tells us that
the value of the thing that we are desiring and the pleasure that it can
provide is far greater than our own souls.  Father, may we understand.  May You
give us wisdom and eyes to see the truth that the real valuable thing is to do
things Your way and to seek Your salvation and to let go and avoid and run from
anything that would get in the way of this.  Father, we pray that You would be
with us the rest of this day, that You would bless Your Word and open up a door
of utterance for the Gospel.  As we go out into the world, we ask that You
would bless Family Radio as it is broadcast into the world.  We pray for the
people of Somalia, that You would open a door there to the oppressed, to Your
elect.  We just pray that You might open a door so that they can hear the
Gospel.  We pray also for everyone at Family Radio, that You might bless them
and their families.  We pray this in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>
