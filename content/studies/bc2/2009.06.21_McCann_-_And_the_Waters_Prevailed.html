<p>If everyone could turn to Genesis 7, which is a chapter that
we have learned a lot about over the last few years.  It is one of many chapters
that the Lord is highlighting at this time of the end.  We really see the great
importance of everything that God has told us in the Bible, especially in
Genesis 7.  </p>

<p>Lord willing, I hope that we can get through the whole
chapter, especially verses 17 through 24, because this is something that I
would like to look at that we have not really looked at before.  This is when
the flood had come.  The flood covered the earth 15 cubits above the highest
mountain of that day.  Of course, in the last verse, in Genesis 7:24, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.  </p>

<p>This is five months and we know how important five months
has become because God has revealed to us that beginning on May 21<sup>st</sup>
in 2011, there will be five months of judgment.  The whole five-month period is
the &ldquo;<b>day of the LORD</b>&rdquo; upon everyone who is left behind, and this fits in
perfectly and it helps us understand the character and the nature of this
five-month period, when we look at these last verses in Genesis 7.  </p>

<p>But let us begin with Genesis 7:1, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
ark; for thee have I seen <span class="underline">righteous</span> before me in this generation.  </p>

<p>God is declaring that Noah is righteous, that he is
justified, we would say, in God&rsquo;s sight.  Actually, the word &ldquo;righteous,&rdquo; if
you look in the previous chapter, in Genesis 6:8-9, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Noah found grace in the eyes of JEHOVAH.  These <i>are </i>the
generations of Noah: Noah was a <span class="underline">just</span> man&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;just&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; in Genesis
7:1.  He was:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;a just man <i>and </i>perfect in his generations, <i>and </i>Noah
walked with God.  </p>

<p>We can see how the Lord is really describing a sparkling
character: Noah was just and perfect; he found grace.  This is definitely saying
that he was a child of God because everything that God says of Noah fits each
and every child of God.  </p>

<p>When we experience the salvation of God, only by the Grace
of God, then we become righteous in God&rsquo;s sight.  &ldquo;<b>By the obedience of one</b>,&rdquo;
Romans tells us, &ldquo;<b>shall many be made righteous</b>.&rdquo;  This is referring to
each child of God.  </p>

<p>We also become perfect, believe it or not.  We become
perfect in our soul existence.  Our soul is without sin, according to 1<sup>st</sup>

John.  But we still have to admit that we sin because we are in the physical body,
even though the Lord looks at the believer as being perfect and without sin
because all of their sins have been paid for in Christ from before the
foundation of the world.  This is why He can say this of Noah or of many people
in the Bible&mdash;Job was &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;; others were &ldquo;just&rdquo; or &ldquo;righteous,&rdquo; like Zacharias
and his wife Elisabeth&mdash;it is all a result of the work that Christ did to pay
for the sins of His people.  </p>

<p>Then in Genesis 7:2-4, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female: and of beasts that <i>are </i>not clean by two, the male and
his female.  Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.  For yet seven days, and I will
cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living
substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>We have learned about Genesis 7:4, that this was an
historical statement.  God said to Noah, &ldquo;You have seven days and then I am
going to bring the flood and destroy the world.&rdquo;  This was a literal week, 168
hours, which is 2 x 84.  God gave them a seven-day period.  Noah, being a &ldquo;<b>preacher
of righteousness</b>,&rdquo; or a preacher of Christ, would have shared this
information with the people of his day.  </p>

<p>The ark itself was a testimony to everyone around because it
was witnessing to the truth that God had given, which was that He was going to
destroy the world with a flood.  This, in itself, was a gigantic declaration to
the inhabitants of the world of Noah&rsquo;s day that their time was short.  </p>

<p>By the way, Noah and all of the people of his day would have
spoken the same language.  It was only one language.  It was not until much
later at the towel of Babel that God confused the tongues.  This means that he
would have been able to potentially share with anyone in the world this
information that God had given him, that they would have at least been able to
understand the language; they would have at least been able to understand what
he was saying.  </p>

<p>We see the problem that we have today with a world that has
so many languages with so many nations.  This requires a great work to
translate the Gospel into the languages of the world and it takes a lot of time. 
Yet the Lord made preparation for this over the years; and now with a ministry
like Family Radio, the Gospel goes out into all the world in many, many
languages.  Probably just about everyone in the world understands one of the
major languages that Family Radio broadcasts the Gospel in.  </p>

<p>But in that day, at that time, the people spoke one
language.  I do not know what it was, but it was only one language.  Also, they
would have pretty much been in one location because the world was not divided
until the days of Peleg, which was about 3100 B.C.  It was almost 1800-2000
years later when the continents would have drifted and God would have divided
the world into the present form that we have it in now with the different
continents.  Therefore, this means that Noah would have had access to the
peoples of the world or that they would have had access to him as they were all
living pretty much as people live today in a society.  So the witness of Noah
would have been widespread to the people of that day.  </p>

<p>Now, in Matthew 24:36, we find the verse that is so popular
today:    </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man </i>[<i>or no one</i>]<i>,
</i>no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  </p>

<p>People go to this verse in order to disprove or use it to
dismiss the information about the date of the rapture being May 21 in 2011. 
They go to this to prove that nobody can know the time of the end, except they
are failing to take into account that God had sealed up the Word &ldquo;<b>till the
time of the end</b>.&rdquo;  The implication is that at the time of the end, He would
open the seals, which is exactly what He has done in order to reveal truth to
people.  This is not of ourselves.  We now know because God has given us
understanding concerning end-time events that are unfolding in relation to time
and judgment.  </p>

<p>Let us look at this carefully in Matthew 24:36-37:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no [<i>one</i>],<i> </i>no, not
the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  But as the days of Noe [<i>Noah</i>]

<i>were, </i>so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>God, the Lord Jesus, is saying, &ldquo;No man knows the day or
hour, and here is an example in history that tells you what I am talking about.&rdquo; 
Okay.  Well, that is good.  So let us keep reading.  Matthew 24:38-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>Well, we are in trouble.  They are right.  No man knows the
day or hour.  God gave us a historical example of the days before the flood. 
Look: it took them all by surprise.  They were eating and drinking.  Nobody
knew until the flood came.  Like &ldquo;<b>a thief in the night</b>,&rdquo; they were
caught off-guard.  </p>

<p>Is this true?  Yes, it is true, but for whom?  It is true
for the <span class="underline">ungodly</span>, as 2 Peter 2 tells us.  Let us just quickly look at
this.  2 Peter 2:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth <i>person,
</i>a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Now, if it had stopped there, we would have to agree, but it
does not:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;upon the world of the ungodly;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the unsaved.  As 1 Thessalonians 5 says,
 Christ will come &ldquo;<b>as a thief in the night&hellip;but ye, brethren, are not in
darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief</b>.&rdquo;  You see, God is
distinguishing between those &ldquo;in the light&rdquo; and those &ldquo;in the darkness,&rdquo; the &ldquo;wheat&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;tares&rdquo;: the truly saved and those who are not saved.  </p>

<p>Christ gives us the example and He puts it right in the
context of no one knowing the day or hour and then He says, &ldquo;Now look at Noah
and look at the days leading up to the flood.  Nobody knew.  It came on them
unexpectedly, <span class="underline">except for Noah and his family</span>.&rdquo;  Except for Noah and his
family, because God had told him a hundred and twenty years prior so that he
could begin building the ark.  Then the Lord came to him seven days before the
actual flood and told him precisely the year, the month, and the day: &ldquo;<b>In
the six hundredth year of Noah&rsquo;s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day
of the month</b>,&rdquo; the flood came.  </p>

<p>This shows us that we had better not be too quick to point
to a verse that says, &ldquo;No one knows the day or hour,&rdquo; and then feel that this
dismisses all the information that we are finding today.  It does not.  It
supports it.  It supports exactly what we thought, that &ldquo;<b>the Lord GOD will
do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets</b>.&rdquo; 
It supports the truth that God will give His people discernment concerning &ldquo;<b>time
and judgment</b>.&rdquo;  This is exactly what He is doing, as He said in Daniel, &ldquo;<b>none
of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Going back to Genesis 7, we know that the historical week,
or the seven days that God gave Noah, also relates to the time pattern of seven
thousand years as 2 Peter 3 tells us.  From 4990 B.C. until 2011 A.D. is that
seven-thousandth year, as &ldquo;<b>one day is&hellip;as a thousand years, and a thousand
years as one day</b>,&rdquo; but we are not going to look at that today.  Let us
continue reading in Genesis 7.  Genesis 7:5-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Noah did according unto all that JEHOVAH commanded him.  And
Noah <i>was </i>six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the
earth.  And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons&rsquo; wives with
him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.  Of clean beasts, and of
beasts that <i>are </i>not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that
creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the
male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven
days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.</p>

<p>So the week passed, just like whatever time we have left
right now will certainly pass.  They will pass just like that.  God said it and
then the seven days were over.  Well, shortly, seven thousand years will be
over and the Lord will bring to pass exactly what He has told us in the Bible,
which is the day of the rapture and the resurrection to life for His people who
will then be taken out of the world and then He will bring the five months of
torment upon all of the unsaved who remain.  </p>

<p>There is not much time left.  There is not much time left
for dealing with God in the matter of salvation; that is, going to Him,
beseeching Him for our own salvation or maybe for others whom we care about and
whom we love.  Actually, the Bible instructs us to love our neighbor and our
fellowman, so this has to be everyone whom we come into contact with.  We would
desire that they do become saved.  </p>

<p>Now, Genesis 7:7 is significant because it tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons&rsquo;
wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.  </p>

<p>The flood occurred on the same day that Noah and his family
found refuge.  It was simultaneous, just like we understand the rapture of God&rsquo;s
people to be simultaneous.  The rapture will begin the five-month period and &ldquo;<b>the

</b><b>day of the LORD&rsquo;S wrath</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Here in Genesis 7, God is fulfilling His Word once again. 
This is because if you look at Genesis 6:18, when God was giving Noah
instructions on building the ark, which we would think would have been one
hundred and twenty years earlier, He said:  </p>

<p class="verse">But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons&rsquo; wives with thee.</p>

<p>The Lord told him beforehand whom He was going to deliver,
who was going to go into the ark with him.  The Lord had shown him this one
hundred and twenty years prior.  </p>

<p>Of course, we can see God&rsquo;s election.  The Lord has already
predestinated whom He intends to save from &ldquo;<b>before the foundation of the
world</b>,&rdquo; as Christ has already paid for the sins of His elect people.  Now
it is just a matter of the history of the world&rsquo;s time elapsing and the last
generation, which is us, to be fulfilled.  Then God will save that &ldquo;<b>great
multitude</b>&rdquo; and He will bring each and every one of His elect into Heaven
through the deliverance that the Lord Jesus has provided for them.  </p>

<p>This is the only reason why the world is continuing right
now and that the &ldquo;<b>day of salvation</b>&rdquo; is possible.  This is because the
Lord is going to save everyone whom He has named in the &ldquo;<b>Lamb&rsquo;s book of life</b>,&rdquo;

just like God told Noah when He indicated eight souls.  </p>

<p>I said earlier that Noah was a &ldquo;<b>preacher of righteousness</b>,&rdquo;
and yet God told him, &ldquo;You are going into the ark, your wife, your sons and
their wives.&rdquo;  He did not name anyone else and no one else went into the ark, just
like the Lord has told us that His elect will enter into Heaven.  We do not know
who they are and so we share the Gospel with everyone.  </p>

<p>It was the same with Noah.  Even though the Lord had told
him that his family would be delivered, he was still preaching the Gospel.  He
was still a &ldquo;<b>preacher of righteousness</b>&rdquo; to the world of his day because the
Lord did not say that it was only the people whom He indicated.  Therefore, Noah
would have continued to witness to others, hoping that maybe there would be
someone else whom God might save.  Yet the Lord fulfilled His Word exactly in
bringing these people into the ark.  </p>

<p>Then in Genesis 7:11, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the six hundredth year of Noah&rsquo;s life, in the <span class="underline">second month</span>,
the <span class="underline">seventeenth day</span> of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  </p>

<p>Who knows why May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 is so significant? 
What day is this in the Hebrew or Biblical calendar?  It is the seventeenth day
of the second month of the Biblical calendar.  </p>

<p>Think about this: &ldquo;<b>o</b><b>ne day is&hellip;as a thousand years</b>.&rdquo; 
If we go from the flood, seven thousand years lands on 2011, which happens to
be the 23<sup>rd</sup> year of the Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p>No one tried to make this fit, because we had been
understanding this for some years prior to even recognizing the time path in
Genesis 7.  Yet people began studying and wondering, &ldquo;Well, what day will the
Great Tribulation come to an end?&rdquo;  We knew that it would have to be May 21<sup>st</sup>

because that is an even 23 years.  It is the 8400<sup>th</sup> day and the
number 84 has everything to do with Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p>So it had to end there, but there was the Feast of
Tabernacles that also had to be fulfilled because it was the third Feast where
the Lord required all males to go to Jerusalem.  We knew that the Lord had fulfilled
the Feast of Passover with Christ being the Passover Lamb.  He had fulfilled
Pentecost in Acts 2 as &ldquo;<b>Pentecost was fully come</b>&rdquo;; this pointed to the
sending out of the Gospel to bring in the firstfruits, which were all those
saved during the church age.  But the third Feast was Tabernacles or Ingathering
and there had been no fulfillment.  </p>

<p>So believers were looking at the date in October and
realizing, &ldquo;Well, how can this work?  How can the Great Tribulation end on May 21, 2011 and that final Feast not find fulfillment?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then there was a correction made when we understood that the
last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was an eighth day that the Lord had
provided for travel.  This nudged October 20 over to the 21<sup>st</sup>.  Eventually
we could see that May 21 to October 21 was a period of five months.  Five
months.  </p>

<p>If we had gone to the Bible to study five months and not
found anything, then it would have meant nothing, but there is five months
spoken of in the Bible.  Coincidentally, it is right in Genesis 7.  Keeping in
mind that the Lord had said, &ldquo;<b>one day is&hellip;as a thousand years, and a thousand
years as one day</b>,&rdquo; we read in the last verse, Genesis 7:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.  </p>

<p>This is a period of five months.  Five months.  Then
Revelation 9 spoke of five months of torment and this torment, as we read the
Bible, came after the door was shut.  And if we read Luke 13 or Matthew 25,
there is &ldquo;<b>weeping and gnashing of teeth</b>&rdquo; once the door is shut.  And May 21, 2011 is the equivalent date to Genesis 7:16, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and JEHOVAH shut him in.  </p>

<p>This is the day.  May 21, 2011 is the day when the Lord will
shut the door and Christ is &ldquo;<b>the door</b>.&rdquo;  He is the only way of entering
into Heaven.  He is the door, the entrance, the portal, the opening, the narrow
gate, as the Bible speaks of this in many ways.  It is only through Him, &ldquo;<b>none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved</b>.&rdquo;  It is
only through Jesus.  </p>

<p>Let us move on to verse 17, Genesis 7:17-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.  And the
waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went
upon the face of the waters.  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
earth; and all the high hills, that <i>were </i>under the whole heaven, were
covered.  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
covered.</p>

<p>Then verse 24, Genesis 7:24: </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.  </p>

<p>What stands out in these verses that we just read?  What
stands out?  &ldquo;<b>The waters prevailed.</b>&rdquo;  At first, the ark was lifted up. 
The waters caused the ark to go up.  It was taken up, which reminds us of the
rapture.  </p>

<p>The Lord is describing what is going to happen on May 21,
2011 because this is the day when the door is shut and this is the day when He
begins to pour out His wrath&mdash;it is the very same day&mdash;and the same water here in
Genesis 7 that lifts up the ark is the water that is suppressing everything
else in the world, pushing it down.  </p>

<p>This is why we have the fossils of the dinosaurs that we
find today.  This is because of the tremendous pressure that was put upon them,
as there would have been great mudslides and the animals would have been caught
in the deluge that came on all the world.  </p>

<p>There was no safe place.  There was nowhere to run because &ldquo;<b>all
the high hills&hellip;and the mountains were covered</b>.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;hills&rdquo; is the
word &ldquo;mountains,&rdquo; so &ldquo;<b>all the high [mountains]&hellip;and the mountains were
covered</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God had brought His waters upon the earth and the waters
accomplished two purposes: they lifted up the ark and they put down man.  They
put down the whole world that had rebelled against God, that world that did &ldquo;<b>only
evil continually</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The world of Noah&rsquo;s day doing &ldquo;<b>only evil continually</b>,&rdquo;
we do not know anything about this in our world do we?  That is a joke.  That
is a joke because that was one or two million people who were sinning
constantly, but imagine six billion, eight hundred million.  </p>

<p>I looked at Wikipedia and as of May 31st, 2009 [<i>note: the speaker inadvertently said &ldquo;2011&rdquo; here when he intended to say &ldquo;2009&rdquo;</i>],
there are six billion, seven hundred and ninety-two million people on the
earth.  We are almost a month past that, so it is probably six billion, eight
hundred million people.  We are getting close to the number seven billion. 
More than likely in 2011, the seven-thousandth year from the flood, the world
will reach that number of seven billion people and God will take out that
little remnant.  It is a &ldquo;<b>great multitude</b>,&rdquo; probably 200 hundred
million, but it is going to leave huge numbers of people behind.  Billions of
people will probably even survive the earthquake of May 21<sup>st</sup> and
will have to live some portion of that five-month period here on earth.  </p>

<p>Well, you see, the emphasis here is that the &ldquo;<b>waters
prevailed</b>.&rdquo;  I wrote down a few verses, so let us go to Exodus 17 and read
just one verse.  Exodus 17:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Psalm 12:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH shall cut off all flattering lips, <i>and </i>the tongue
that speaketh proud things: Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our
lips <i>are </i>our own: who <i>is </i>lord over us?  </p>

<p>One more verse.  Isaiah 42:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against
his enemies.  </p>

<p>There are other verses, too, that speak of prevailing with a
mighty hand or prevailing with great strength.  &ldquo;Prevail&rdquo; is a word that really
indicates &ldquo;victory&rdquo; and &ldquo;triumph.&rdquo;  It is the Lord&rsquo;s triumph against His
enemies, against all the rebels who dare rebel against the great King of
Heaven: little, tiny, finite man who dares to shake his hand at &ldquo;<b>the King of
kings, and Lord of lords</b>&rdquo; and thinks that he can get away with it and
thinks that his life is his own and that he has no obligation to obey or to
serve the Creator.  But God is saying, &ldquo;No so; not so.&rdquo;  His Word will
prevail.  </p>

<p>Notice that I said &ldquo;Word,&rdquo; but it was the waters that
prevailed.  &ldquo;<b>The waters prevailed&hellip;upon the earth</b>.&rdquo;  Yes, but what does &ldquo;water&rdquo;
represent in the Bible?  &ldquo;Water&rdquo; represents God&rsquo;s Word.  For instance, let us
go to Habakkuk 2:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of
JEHOVAH, as the waters cover the sea.  </p>

<p>This is the knowledge of God, which only comes through the
Word of God.  At this time, we are sharing information with people in every way
possible.  God&rsquo;s people are going to be even more imaginative, even more
desirous to get this Word out.  People are having their vans designed with
information about May 21, 2011 and they are riding around town.  People are
putting up billboards.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that God does not need much of His Word to save
and a billboard is an excellent tool for sharing information.  This is why
there is such a big advertising business in the world; they realize that
advertising works.  This is in the business world and we do not want to get
into that, but we do want to advertise the information that May 21 is going to
be the rapture.  Tracts are going out into the world and there is word-of-mouth
on the Internet.  It is spreading.  </p>

<p>Daniel 12:4 speaks of the Word being sealed &ldquo;<b>to the time
of the end</b>&rdquo; and then he says &ldquo;<b>knowledge shall be increased</b>.&rdquo;  It is
true that this has to do with an understanding of God&rsquo;s people, as the Lord
gives us the ability to understand end-time things, but I think that it also
relates to this verse in Habakkuk: &ldquo;<b>The knowledge of the glory of JEHOVAH</b>&rdquo;

is going to cover the earth &ldquo;<b>as the waters cover the sea</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Word is going to get out to all the world, to all of the
world over the time that we have left.  It <span class="underline">will</span> go into every country
and every city and all of the people of the earth are going to hear.  The Word
of the Lord is declaring this.  </p>

<p>When May 21, 2011 comes, God takes up His people out of the
world&mdash;there will be a worldwide earthquake and the resurrection of His
people&mdash;and everyone will know.  Everyone will know that what they have been
hearing was the truth.  The Word of God was true and faithful.  The Word of God
was proven right.  The Word of God is then glorified during that five-month
period and this is what is in view with the waters covering the earth.  </p>

<p>If we go to 1 Peter 3, it speaks of Christ preaching to &ldquo;<b>spirits
in prison</b>&rdquo; during the days prior to the flood.  Spiritually, it is saying
that God preached to the unsaved who are in a spiritual dungeon of their own
making through their sin, as well as being captives of Satan.  Christ preached
through Noah, as he was &ldquo;<b>a preacher of righteousness</b>.&rdquo;  Then it says in
1 Peter 3:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of
God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few,
that is, eight souls were saved by water.  </p>

<p>They were &ldquo;<b>saved by water</b>,&rdquo; because it is the Word of
God.  This is typifying the Word of God.  The water lifted them up.  It
delivered those in the ark at the same time that it destroyed the rest; it
condemned the rest of the world.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 21, 1 Peter 3:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">The like figure whereunto <i>even </i>baptism doth also now save
us&hellip;  </p>

<p>The figure of baptism is the washing of water.  As it says
in Ephesians 5:26, it is &ldquo;<b>the washing of water by the word</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is likening the flood to His Word, to His Gospel. 
His Gospel has the power to save and the power to condemn and destroy.  </p>

<p>Or go to Revelation 12:15, as this is describing Satan&rsquo;s
attempt to destroy the people of God.  I will read verse 14 into 15. 
Revelation 12:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
might fly into the wilderness, into her place&hellip;  </p>

<p>And she represents the believers.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time,
from the face of the serpent.  And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a
flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
flood.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Water as a flood</b>&rdquo; is what?  When Satan comes as &ldquo;<b>an
angel of light</b>,&rdquo; he comes looking like Christ and developing false gospels
that are false teachings.  It is using the Word of God in a wrong way.  He
throws that out there in church after church after church in order to trap and
carry away the ungodly.  His hope is to finally destroy one of God&rsquo;s elect, but
this cannot happen and it will never happen.  Yet here we see that the &ldquo;<b>water
as a flood</b>&rdquo; does relate to the Word of God; it relates to the Bible.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 7:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
high hills&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, &ldquo;hills&rdquo; are &ldquo;mountains.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that <i>were </i>under the whole heaven, were covered.  Fifteen
cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.  </p>

<p>Why does God make a point of telling us this?  He wants us
to know that the whole world was flooded, that the flood was so great that
everything in the world was covered.  If you cover the mountain that is way up
there and the water is fifteen cubits above the mountain peak, then you have
covered everything else and the whole earth is covered.  </p>

<p>But the high hills and the mountains also represent
something in the Bible.  They represent the Kingdom of God.  It could be the
eternal kingdom, as the Lord speaks of the &ldquo;<b>holy hill of Zion</b>&rdquo; and uses
language to describe coming to His mountain, which relates to salvation, but
there are also verses that tie in with the corporate churches and
congregations.  </p>

<p>For instance, let us go to 1 Kings 16:24 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built,
after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.  </p>

<p>And the word &ldquo;hill&rdquo; is the same Hebrew word as &ldquo;mountain.&rdquo; 
It is number 2022 in Strong&rsquo;s.  </p>

<p>So Samaria was built on a mountain; it was built on a hill,
and look at what the Lord says in Amos 6:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe to them <i>that are </i>at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain
 of Samaria&hellip;  </p>

<p>Are some people trusting in a mountain?  They are trusting
in what that mountain represents today, which is the church; it is the churches
and congregations.  The churches and their leaders are being trusted.  </p>

<p>Let us say that there is a poor soul who is already in
trouble because he is in the church when God has finished using the churches
and congregations and anyone who remains in the church on the last day will be
destroyed, but there is a poor soul who somehow hears the information that the
rapture is coming.  He goes to his pastor and his pastor says, &ldquo;Do not worry
about it.  The source that you are hearing this from, I could tell you a lot
about how wacky they are.&rdquo;  Then the pastor says, &ldquo;Remember, the Bible says, &lsquo;no
man knows the day or hour.&rsquo;&rdquo;  So this member of the church pauses and thinks, &ldquo;Yes,
the Bible does say that no man knows the day or our.  You know what?  I do not
have anything to worry about.  I am going to listen to my pastor and I am going
to listen to my church.  I am just not going to bother with checking this out any
further.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, he trusted in his pastor and he trusted in his church
and on that day of May 21 when the Word of God prevails and the Lord makes it
clear that, yes, this <span class="underline">was</span> coming from Him, that these things were coming
out of the Bible&mdash;just as much as the message that God gave Jonah to give to the
Ninevites came from God Himself&mdash;then there is going to be a situation like we
read in Isaiah 2:10-17, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
JEHOVAH, and for the glory of his majesty.  The lofty looks of man shall be
humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and JEHOVAH alone
shall be exalted in that day.  For the day of JEHOVAH of hosts <i>shall be </i>upon
every <i>one that is </i>proud and lofty, and upon every <i>one that is </i>lifted
up; and he shall be brought low: And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, <i>that
are </i>high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, And upon all the
high mountains, and upon all the hills <i>that are </i>lifted up, And upon
every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, And upon all the ships of
Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.  And the loftiness of man shall be
bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and JEHOVAH alone
shall be exalted in that day.</p>

<p>This is the &ldquo;<b>day of the LORD</b>&rdquo;: May 21, 2011.  You see, God is bringing everyone who exalted themselves down, just like the waters
suppressed everyone in the world.  It brought them low and the Word of the Lord
prevailed.  The Word of the Lord was glorified and lifted up.  </p>

<p>We also find this language in Revelation 6, which we know
deals with the five-month period because it speaks of &ldquo;<b>the sun became black&hellip;the
moon became as blood&hellip; the stars of heaven fell</b>,&rdquo; which Matthew 24:29 tells
us happens &ldquo;<b>immediately after the tribulation</b>.&rdquo;  Then it says in
Revelation 6:14-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.  And the kings of
the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the
mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens
and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on
us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be
able to stand?</p>

<p>You see, the Lord is telling us that the people of the world
are going to run to the churches and they are going to desperately seek
spiritual help, they are going to desperately seek some answer for what has
happened and a covering for themselves in that awful day, and yet there is no
covering.  There is no hope; there is no salvation possible.  </p>

<p>It is only now; it is only at this time and for a short
while from now that God has the door to the ark opened, we could say, as the
ark represents Christ and there is only safety and refuge in Him.  It is at
this time that a person can experience God&rsquo;s grace and mercy and not at any
other time (after May 21, 2011).  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 7:20 for one last thing:  </p>

<p class="verse">Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.  </p>

<p>And 15 is made up of two numbers: 3 x 5.  It is God&rsquo;s
purpose that the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ will be completed and
will bring His people into Heaven.  At the same time, those whom Christ did not
atone for their sins, those who did not have a Saviour, will be destroyed after
the five-month period.  Actually, during that five months, they are going to
experience the terrible anger and wrath of God for as long as they live during
that period.  Then the Lord&rsquo;s salvation plan will be completed and finished,
and it is His purpose that all of these things are going to take place.  His
Word will then be glorified.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
