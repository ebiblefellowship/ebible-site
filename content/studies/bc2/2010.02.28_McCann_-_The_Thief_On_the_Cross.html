<p>Today I would like to look at some of the Scriptures that
deal with the thief on the cross.  I had planned to look at this passage the
last week before Judgment Day May 21, 2011, because this is a passage that
deals with a shortness of time.  There is no one who had as little time left in
this life and knew it like the thief on the cross.  He only had a few hours
before he was going to die and pass away, so I would like to look at this
today.  </p>

<p>To begin with, I would like to read all of the Gospel
accounts of this occurrence.  But before we do so, I would just like to offer
some caution concerning the whole subject of being saved at practically the
last minute of one&rsquo;s life.  </p>

<p>We will begin in Matthew 27.  I will read a few passages
from the Bible that are fairly long.  It always guarantees that a message will
be a blessing when we read a lot of Scripture.  You do not have to do much else
to be blessed.  </p>

<p>We read in Matthew 27:34-44:  </p>

<p class="verse">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
had tasted <i>thereof, </i>he would not drink. And they crucified him, and
parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
they cast lots. And sitting down they watched him there; And set up over his
head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were
there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the
left. And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, And saying,
Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it </i>in three days, save
thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also the
chief priests mocking <i>him, </i>with the scribes and elders, said, He saved
others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come
down from the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him
deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The
thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  </p>

<p>There were two thieves.  God said &ldquo;thieves,&rdquo; plural, and
that they were saying the same thing as the chief priests and as everyone
else.  </p>

<p>This was the hour of darkness.  The whole world it seemed
had turned against the Lord Jesus Christ.  Everyone present was involved in
reviling Him, which was all part of God&rsquo;s plan because Christ was making a
demonstration on the cross.  He was not dying for sin because He had already
died for sin from before the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us that He was &ldquo;the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world.&rdquo;  He also resurrected before the world began because
Romans 1 tells us that He was &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God&hellip;by [<i>or
via</i>] the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo;  As the Son, He created this world
and the universe and all of the creatures and man and everything that we see;
however, He was already declared to be the Son through the resurrection of the
dead.  </p>

<p>What was the point then of Him entering into the world and
going through this experience?  He was making what He had already done manifest,
the works that &ldquo;were finished from the foundation of the world,&rdquo; according to
Hebrews 4.  And the Bible says &ldquo;for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.&rdquo; 
This is what the Bible says, and Jesus came to be &ldquo;the light of the world.&rdquo;  He
came to shine the light in the darkness and to make manifest what man would
never figure out on his own and could never understand.  </p>

<p>God had already completed His salvation plan, which means
that Jesus, who is God, selected and predestinated each and every one of His
elect from the foundation of the world.  He took upon Himself the sins of each
and every one of them.  They were laid upon Him, which is what it means when
the Bible refers to bearing iniquities.  Wherever we read in the Bible about Christ
bearing iniquities, it is always referring to the point before this world
began.  This is because at the cross, He was not bearing iniquity.  </p>

<p>Since Jesus had already accomplished this, there was no sin
left to bear.  It is not like He had to bear sin a second time on the cross and
make payment a second time.  We know that God&rsquo;s Word does not require this. 
The Law of God does not demand this.  He was just simply living out a tableau or
making these things manifest.  He was revealing them and shining the light on
what He had already done.  This is what we have to understand whenever we are
reading the Gospel accounts.  </p>

<p>If we go to Mark 15:22-33, we read a parallel account to
Matthew.  It says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
interpreted, The place of a skull. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with
myrrh: but he received <i>it </i>not. And when they had crucified him, they
parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And it
was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the superscription of his
accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify
two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the
scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the
transgressors. And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it </i>in three
days, Save thyself, and come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief
priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others;
himself he cannot save. Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the
cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him
reviled him. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.  </p>

<p>I wanted to include that last verse to give us a little time
reference.  </p>

<p>So for a period of time, both thieves&mdash;one on his right, one
on his left, with Jesus in the center&mdash;were saying, &ldquo;Yes, save yourself and us
with you!&rdquo;  But they were saying this in such a way that they were
demonstrating that they intended to give no honor or respect or glory to Christ
as the Saviour.  </p>

<p>This was definitely not something that was appropriate, as
God outlines the Gospel, because there is a certain way in which we are to go
to God to beseech Him for salvation.  They were basically saying, &ldquo;Deliver us!&rdquo; 
But they were saying this in a demanding way, in an arrogant way, in a prideful
way, almost as if, &ldquo;You saved others!  You must save us!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>People hear that Christ is a wonderful Saviour, a merciful
God, and He does save others.  This is true.  There is forgiveness with God. 
He will save a great multitude, but He is not obligated to save any individual. 
He does not have to save you or me.  He does not have to save anyone.  If He
wanted to, He could let us all be destroyed, and that would be proper and
right.  </p>

<p>He is merciful, however, and so He does this glorious work
of saving many, which is really only a remnant out of the total of mankind.  But
still, tens of millions of people is a large number of people and God could potentially
save any one of us; however, it is very important how we approach Him.  </p>

<p>If you remember, we read of an historical account of Elijah
as he was on the mountain when the king of Israel had sent a captain and his
fifty to bring Elijah the prophet back to the king.  We read of this in 2 Kings
1.  It starts off in 2 Kings 1:2-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
that <i>was </i>in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto
them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this
disease. But the angel of JEHOVAH said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to
meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, <i>Is it </i>not
because <i>there is </i>not a God in Israel, <i>that </i>ye go to inquire of
Baalzebub the god of Ekron? Now therefore thus saith JEHOVAH, Thou shalt not
come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And
Elijah departed. </p>

<p>These were some very strong statements that God had spoken
through His prophet Elijah; but after his sin of seeking after another god, the
king knew that his life depended on this.  He had an army at his disposal.  He
had officers, and so he probably commanded one of his best captains, &ldquo;Take your
company of fifty and go to this man of God, Elijah, and bring him to me,&rdquo; as we
read in 2 Kings 1:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. </p>

<p>This would be fifty-one men.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, <span class="underline">Come</span> <span class="underline">down</span>. 
</p>

<p>Is this the way in which we are to speak to God?  No.  Is
this the way in which we are to speak to one of God&rsquo;s representatives, a
prophet of the Lord, the one whom God spoke through and gave His Word through,
Elijah?  No.  </p>

<p>We read next of what can happen when we speak to God in this
way.  Remember that Elijah is basically there in God&rsquo;s stead.  We read in 2
Kings 1:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I <i>be
</i>a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.  </p>

<p>These men were destroyed instantly.  They were annihilated. 
These men were more than likely unsaved, and so their lives were over at this
point and they ceased to exist.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s judgment plan, and yet He is merciful even in
this.  &ldquo;The wages of sin <i>is </i>death&rdquo;; a man dies, he perishes, and the
Bible tells us &ldquo;in that very day his thoughts perish.&rdquo;  Unsaved man is not going
to be resurrected with his thoughts put back into him so that he becomes a
conscious living being again.  The Bible does not teach this.  Instead, unsaved
man is just done.  </p>

<p>As we continue on in 2 Kings, remember that the king is
going to die.  This is what he heard from this prophet, and he does not care
that fifty-one people were just burned up.  His only interest is in his own
life and in his own recovery, and so he sends another group, as we read in 2
Kings 1:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
fifty. </p>

<p>So this is another fifty-one men.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the
king said, <span class="underline">Come</span> <span class="underline">down</span> <span class="underline">quickly</span>.  </p>

<p>Again we can see the arrogance, as though man can dictate to
God!  But we are not God.  We are not the Creator.  We are a creature.  We are
a little, tiny, finite creature, and God is the infinite and glorious Creator,
the Almighty, the Everlasting God, the &ldquo;One that inhabiteth eternity.&rdquo;  He
created us, but what we have done is rebelled against Him.  We have gone our
own way and transgressed His Law.  We have basically spit in His face.  We live
our life any way that we please.  We sin day after day.  The thoughts of our
heart are &ldquo;only evil continually.&rdquo;  Our hearts are &ldquo;deceitful above all <i>things,
</i>and desperately wicked&rdquo;; and yet at a certain point, we go to God, we
approach Him, and we have the audacity to make demands of Him!  </p>

<p>This is not how the Bible lays this out.  This is not how
God lays out His salvation plan.  He is merciful, yes; but we had better not
think that because He is merciful, He must have mercy upon us.  This is not
so.  This is not the case.  He says in Romans 9, &ldquo;Therefore hath he mercy on
whom he will <i>have mercy</i>.&rdquo;  This is His decision, not ours.  </p>

<p>Returning to 2 Kings 1, so far we have 102 men: two captains
with two companies of fifty men each.  These two groups have gone to the
prophet and have both been burned up, but the king is desperate.  He has many
more captains at his disposal, and so he sends a third captain with his fifty,
as we read in 2 Kings 1:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before
Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my
life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.  </p>

<p>Do you notice a difference?  This captain is approaching God
fearfully.  This man has a fear of God.  He also probably learned something
from the first two captains and their fifty.  He might have even known these
men who had been burned up.  He must have realized that they were gone.  As
this third captain and his fifty approached Elijah, they maybe even saw their
ashes.  There was a great deal of evidence for this man to understand who he
was dealing with, that God is a God of great power and authority and glory.  He
may have thought, &ldquo;Yes, I am coming at the king&rsquo;s command because this is my
job.  I am a soldier and I have to obey the king, but I know who the King of
kings is.  I know that we could gather a million kings like the king I serve on
earth and they would be as nothing in comparison to this King.  All of the
armies of the world do not have this type of power to where they can burn up
men by calling down fire from Heaven.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this captain approached gingerly, humbly.  He came
praying and beseeching Elijah.  He came very humbly and this is how God lays
this out, as far as His graciousness in allowing us, who are rebels, to come to
Him for pardon.  He is very gracious to even allow this and permit this.  He
does allow the condemned sinner to go to Him like a criminal, like a murderer
on death row.  </p>

<p>Even today, this is allowed.  A murderer can contact the
governor of the state and can ask, &ldquo;Please, will you pardon me?&rdquo;  Many probably
say that they should be pardoned because they are innocent, and I can imagine
that the governor just throws that kind of letter away.  Someone else can go to
the governor and say, &ldquo;Look, I am guilty.  I am guilty and I deserve what I am
going to get, but I know that you are a kind governor.&rdquo;  As he is making his
request to the governor and beseeching him for pardon, he emphasizes, &ldquo;There is
nothing in me that you should stay my execution or even pardon me from dying,
but do so only because of your goodness and who you are as governor.&rdquo;  Then, at
least, the governor would read the letter.  The governor would read the letter
if it was laid out this way.  </p>

<p>But then maybe there is someone who had killed three people
who plans on writing the governor&mdash;and we should not think that we are any
better than someone who has killed others, because sin is sin and we are all
guilty of sin before God&mdash;but this man is just a hardened man.  His problem all
of his life has been his proud nature and his arrogance.  He writes the
governor and says, &ldquo;Pardon me!  You must pardon me!&rdquo;  He makes this demand, but
there is no way that the governor is going to pardon him.  The execution will
be carried out according to schedule and he will die in whatever way has been
declared that he will die.  </p>

<p>And we are all also going to die unless God has mercy.  This
is the only way out.  The only escape is if God has mercy and grants a pardon,
because each one of us is guilty.  The Bible says, &ldquo;For all have sinned, and come
short of the glory of God.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The wages of sin <i>is </i>death,&rdquo; and this is
what we are going to experience if we are not pardoned from our sin by May 21
in 2011.  </p>

<p>Notice that there were three captains and companies of
fifty, which equals 153.  We will not get into how this could relate to the 153
fish in John 21, but we can see the one-third/two-third relationship that we
find in the book of Zechariah where the Lord speaks of one-third representing
His people and two-thirds representing those who are not His people.  This is
what is laid out here in 2 Kings 1.  </p>

<p>Returning to the Gospels and looking at information
concerning the two thieves, let us go to John 19:30-33.  It says:   </p>

<p class="verse">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. The Jews therefore,
because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the
cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that </i>they might be taken
away. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other
which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was
dead already, they brake not his legs:  </p>

<p>So this is the end of the two thieves.  They died on the
cross.  Their legs were broken to make sure that they were dead.  However, they
did not break the legs of Jesus.  God had prophesied of this, &ldquo;A bone of him
shall not be broken,&rdquo; and God always fulfills His Word and keeps all of His
promises.  </p>

<p>If we only had this information that we have read from
Matthew, Mark, and John, we would have to say that they got exactly what was
coming to them, obviously.  They were two thieves who had lived their whole
lives in rebellion, not only against God but against the law of the land.  </p>

<p>Somehow, in the eyes of man, rebelling against the law of
the land makes people worse than just being a common rebel against God, which
we all are.  You can be a good person in the world&rsquo;s eyes if you are just a
common rebel against God; but if you are rebel against the law of the land
where it is more outward and people can see it because it is visible and
evident and you cause harm to other people, then you are no good.  </p>

<p>The Bible, however, does not make this kind of distinction. 
The Bible says, &ldquo;all have sinned&rdquo; and &ldquo;there is none righteous, no, not one,&rdquo;
that there is &ldquo;none good.&rdquo;  In the entire world, we are all equally no good. 
Murderers, liars, thieves, homosexuals, you name it, whatever the sin is, we are
all equally transgressors of the Law.  </p>

<p>We may not have one of these particular sin weaknesses in
our life, but we have sin and sin will begin to show itself in our life.  If we
know the Word of God, we will begin to realize this about ourselves.  We will
realize that, yes, according to the Law of this great King, we deserve to die. 
The law of the king of England might put to death someone who usurps the
authority of the crown; much more so, we deserve to die for usurping the
authority of the crown of Almighty God.  </p>

<p>We have to realize that when God is speaking of these
thieves, He is speaking of us.  Any one of us could also be there.  Spiritually,
He has man in view.  He had one man on the right and one man on the left, and
the sheep and the goats were separated to the right and to the left.  Normally,
those on the right typify those whom God has saved, while those on the left
typify those whom God has not saved, and so we could speculate as to which one
was on the right and which one was on the left.  </p>

<p>But according to the accounts that we read, everything
worked out as it really should have, as it naturally would have, except there
is one more Gospel.  If we go to Luke 23:35-43, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided
<i>him, </i>saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the
chosen of God. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
him vinegar, And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a
superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and
Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Malefactor&rdquo; means &ldquo;evildoer.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.  </p>

<p>Notice that this says that just one of the evildoers is
railing on Him.  It is not both anymore; it is just the one thief.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we
receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. And
he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in
paradise.  </p>

<p>Is this not something?  This just gives us great hope and
encouragement.  </p>

<p>Here is a man who wasted his life.  Basically, when you come
down to it, he wasted his life.  Even if he was a successful thief, he wasted
his life.  He finally got caught and put in prison.  The Romans were definitely
a people of law.  They had very strict but very just laws.  They sentenced him
to death, and so his life came to an end.  Yet before he died&mdash;and we do not
know exactly how long, maybe a couple of hours, maybe we could measure it in
minutes; we know that the time did not reach a day or even a half day&mdash;but right
before he died, God transformed him and changed him into a new man, a new
creature.  He saved him based on nothing that this thief had done because,
remember, he &ldquo;cast the same in his teeth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What good work was involved with this?  Where was he trying
to keep the Law of God at all as he was saying the same thing that everyone
else was saying and reviling Christ who was right next to him?  </p>

<p>So there was nothing in him that Christ suddenly saw that
caused Him to save him due to him stirring up within himself some level of
moral goodness.  No, he was a thief.  He was a condemned criminal who was about
to die.  He was acting on the cross just like he probably acted throughout his entire
life.  He was arrogant and casting the same in God&rsquo;s face as he was right there
next to Him.  </p>

<p>Just think that for three and a half years, Christ had been
ministering the Gospel in that area of Palestine.  In that area, He had been
healing the sick, giving sight to the blind and ears to the deaf.  For this
period of time, He had been raising the dead, cleansing the lepers.  </p>

<p>And where were these two men during those three and a half
years?  They were probably living in that area.  Would they have heard about
the things that Christ had done?  Yes, more than likely, because this news was
spreading everywhere.  </p>

<p>Did they care?  They did not care.  Did this impact the way
in which they were living their lives in any way?  Everyone had to have been
saying that the great Saviour, the Messiah, was come.  They had to have been at
least saying that a great prophet had risen up amongst the people.  Did this
impact the way in which these two men were living in any sense?  </p>

<p>No, evidently not, because here they were in prison.  It is
unlikely that the Romans had the system that we have where condemned men stay
in prison for years and years and years before their execution.  They would
have had a much more speedy judgment and execution process.  We see that Christ
was judged by Pilate and then led to the cross very quickly.  </p>

<p>So these men had probably recently been apprehended, thrown
into prison, and then they had their opportunity to stand before the Roman
judges before they were sentenced to die.  This was now being carried out; and
yet all along, Jesus had been right before them and in their midst while ministering
to the people of the world.  But this did not impact them and they did not
care.  They could have been there when the crowd was thronging him and the
woman with the issue of blood was healed.  Maybe they were just walking by or
maybe they curiously stood around as He was doing these things.  </p>

<p>The point is that even though they had absolutely no
interest themselves in Christ and in the Gospel and in God or in His salvation,
God had interest in one of them.  It is salvation when God takes interest in
you, not when someone tries to go to God and bring salvation to themselves. 
Salvation is when God has selected you and, therefore, He has 100% guaranteed
that you will be saved at some point in your life before you die.  </p>

<p>So He shows with the account of this thief that a man can
live a wretched life all of his days, come to the very end of his life, and
because He is one of God&rsquo;s elect, God saves him.  And God did save this man.  </p>

<p>Here is where the caution needs to come in that I mentioned
earlier.  I give just a few words of caution because what does this remind us
of if not a deathbed conversion?  Right?  He is not lounging on a bed, he is on
the cross, but he has come to the end of his life.  </p>

<p>The idea that many have and that the churches put forth is
that, yes, there is always hope, right up until the end.  This is true, but
they misuse this idea.  They say that there is always hope right up until the
very end because at any point in time someone can decide to accept Christ. 
They think that if someone is on their deathbed and about to die, before the
spirit leaves that person&rsquo;s body, they can turn to their priest or they can
turn to their minister and they can say, &ldquo;Oh, Father, I have sinned.  Forgive
me,&rdquo; and God will grant them forgiveness.  Any priest will say this.  The
ministers of the Gospel are typically not that bold, even though they might
imply this.  </p>

<p>So the idea that is basically out there is that people keep
a monitor of their health.  They check their physical condition.  The reason
for so many check-ups is probably because people want to make sure that they do
not have cancer or any physical disease that might threaten their life.  If
they are not physically ill, then they can go and live like they please and the
way that they want to.  If they do have a serious illness, then maybe they will
start to get serious about God, especially if they get so ill that the doctor
says that they have little time to live.  </p>

<p>But what is the problem with this idea?  If we go to John 1:12, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, <i>even </i>to them that believe on his name:  </p>

<p>This is a verse that many churches like to cite, but they
stop here and do not read on.  They want to encourage people to just believe
and then they will be saved.  However, they need to continue on to the next
verse.  </p>

<p>John 1:13 says:</p>

<p class="verse">Which were born&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a reference to being born again.  Jesus said, &ldquo;Ye
must be born again,&rdquo; and He was not talking about the first birth.  He was
talking about the spiritual birth that comes with salvation.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which were born, not of blood&hellip;</p>

<p>It does not matter if you are a Jew.  It does not matter if
your father is a pastor.  It does not matter who you are or whom you are
related to.  Being born again has nothing to do with family.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man&hellip;  </p>

<p>In other words, a man cannot be born again by his own flesh
or by his own will.  It means nothing to exercise your will.  </p>

<p>Is there free will?  Not unto the point of salvation.  No
one can become saved by exercising their free will.  God says right here that
we are not born again by our own will.  This is a clear repudiation of the
freewill doctrine.  There is no way that anyone becomes born again by this
manner.</p>

<p>So how can anyone become born again?  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;nor of the will of man, but of God.  </p>

<p>It is by the will of God.  It is according to His will.  The
Bible tells us, &ldquo;Salvation <i>is </i>of the LORD.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There are so many verses that we could go to that would
point this out, and we are going to go to a few.  Let us go to Ephesians 2. 
These are familiar verses, but they speak the truth that man cannot get himself
saved.  In Ephesians 2:8-9, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: <i>it is </i>the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should
boast.  </p>

<p>This tells us that faith is &ldquo;not of works,&rdquo; but the Bible
says that faith is a work.  </p>

<p>We read in John 6:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that
ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  </p>

<p>It is not our work; it is God&rsquo;s work.  It is the work of
God.  </p>

<p>Another way of putting it is that it is &ldquo;the faith of Christ.&rdquo; 
The Bible says that &ldquo;a man is not justified by the works of the law.&rdquo;  But when
the Bible says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,&rdquo;
and a man says, &ldquo;I believe Lord,&rdquo; he just committed a work of the Law.  </p>

<p>However, we cannot be justified by the works of the Law and
faith is a work.  This is because any command in the Bible is a Law of God, and
any attempt to obey any command in the Bible is a work that man is doing; but no
work of any kind can get a person saved.  </p>

<p>So it therefore says in Ephesians 2:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: <i>it is </i>the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should
boast.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 19:23-24.  We read there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto
you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>Has anyone ever seen a camel going through a needle&rsquo;s eye? 
And, please, no one should mention camel soup.  People try to get around the
Word of God, and so they think, &ldquo;Well, how could this be possible?&rdquo;  This is
not possible!  A camel cannot go through a needle&rsquo;s eye and neither can a rich
man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven and be born again.  </p>

<p>We will not get into this, but God is not saying that,
therefore, poor men are guaranteed to enter in.  This was not what He was
saying, but the disciples were shocked because they thought that if a rich man could
not, then no one could.  This is because they thought that a rich man had, at
least, some blessing of God on his life.  </p>

<p>But nobody can get themselves into the Kingdom of Heaven. 
If it were possible to take one of those big camels that you see on Discovery
Channel and get a little sewing needle and jam that camel through the eye of a
needle, then you could probably get into Heaven by your own works.  But is this
possible?  No, this is impossible.  </p>

<p>What does Jesus say next?  We read in Matthew 19:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">When his disciples heard <i>it, </i>they were exceedingly
amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld <i>them, </i>and said
unto them, With men this&hellip;  </p>

<p>What is He referring to?  He is referring to being saved and
He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>

<p>It is impossible.  It is great theater and very dramatic
when the preacher is up on his podium at the crusade and he is stirring up the
people, &ldquo;Oh, will you not be saved?&rdquo;  Then they come down the aisle and they get
baptized, and it does not mean anything.  It is vanity and it is emptiness, and
no one became saved.  </p>

<p>I think that God would purposefully resist those who do
this.  Of course, His Word saved during the church age.  Nonetheless, He has a
very set way of salvation and when man goes contrary to God&rsquo;s way and thinks
that they can get someone saved, I think that God would be actively resisting
the pridefulness of this act, the haughtiness of thinking that you could lift
yourself up into Heaven and &ldquo;sit together in heavenly <i>places </i>in Christ
Jesus&rdquo; by walking an aisle, by saying the sinner&rsquo;s prayer, by accepting Christ,
by being sprinkled or immersed in water, by partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s table, by
showing up regularly every week, by giving your money, by singing the hymns,
etc.  None of this contributes at all towards salvation, absolutely none of
it.  No one ever became saved in this manner.  </p>

<p>So how does anyone become saved?  By God.  This is all that
we need to know.  How do I become saved?  God.  God!  The merciful God!  The
gracious God!  </p>

<p>Look at Christ as He went around in His day in that area of Palestine. 
People flocked to Him to be healed of their physical illnesses.  Again and
again and again, His response was, &ldquo;I will.  Be thou healed.&rdquo;  He gave sight. 
He gave hearing.  He even picked up an ear off of the ground that Peter had cut
off and put it back on the person.  He is most kind and good and gentle and
loving, and we have to realize that this is the nature of God.  But we also
have to realize how high and mighty He is and that He sits upon a glorious
throne.  He is high and lifted up.  </p>

<p>So we go humbly to the throne of grace.  We go respectfully,
like that one captain and his fifty, &ldquo;I pray Thee that I might not perish like
these others.&rdquo;  And we go only for Christ&rsquo;s sake.  It is never because of
something that we have done or ever could do.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Romans 9:15-16.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then <i>it is </i>not
of him that willeth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, forget your will.  Forget exercising your will by &ldquo;choosing&rdquo;
 Christ and thinking that this is within your power and within your control. 
God says:  </p>

<p class="verse">So then <i>it is </i>not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember that it says in the Psalms, &ldquo;I will run the way of
thy commandments,&rdquo; and so it is not keeping God&rsquo;s commandments.  It is not
running after the commandments and then thinking that you are going to become
saved because you are obeying the Law.  It is not that:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but of God that showeth mercy.  </p>

<p>Every time, this is the one consistent thing: God.  God.  He
is the One.  He is the One who has the power.  Forgiveness is with Him, real
forgiveness, real mercy.  He really does exercise the ability and the authority
and the power to bestow grace, just like King Ahasuerus when he extended his
golden scepter and permitted Esther to come forth to touch the end of it so
that she would not die.  God has this power within Him.  </p>

<p>Before we close, I just want to give a second word of
caution about the thief on the cross and the hope that this glorious and
wonderful passage gives us, which is that today is the day of salvation.  It is
still the day of salvation.  Today is the day of salvation, tomorrow is the day
of salvation, and it will be the day of salvation up until May 21.  Up until
May 21 of 2011, it is the day of salvation.  The door is open.  Anyone,
potentially and possibly and from our perspective, could become saved.  </p>

<p>God permits sinners to approach Him.  If they approach Him
in the right way, He will at least hear.  We can pray and we can pray
continually.  Again and again, we can pray this day and we can say, &ldquo;Lord, have
mercy, have mercy; please save me.&rdquo;  And maybe nothing happens; but instead of
being discouraged about it, we should thank God that there is still tomorrow.  </p>

<p>There were a couple of people who wrote to our website. 
They saw the &ldquo;May 21, 2011 Judgment Day!&rdquo; tract and they saw the date.  They
obviously have the wrong understanding of the Gospel, of the Bible, because the
person wrote, &ldquo;Look at what you are doing to the Gospel!  Someone could live as
he pleases, any old way, right up until May 20<sup>th</sup>.  Then he could
repent and God would save him.  You see, there would be no holiness in his life
whatsoever!&rdquo; </p>

<p>This is the exact same false idea as the deathbed conversion
to think that someone could wait up until the last moment, because someone is
really thinking then that salvation is within their power and under their
control.  They think that people can wait until they get closer.  Maybe they
would not want to go right up to the edge, right up to May 20<sup>th</sup>, but
they think that they can wait maybe until May 21 of this year.  Or maybe they
think that they can wait until Thanksgiving or Christmas or the New Year.  At
that time, it will be 2011.  </p>

<p>People think that they can wait, that they can put it off
until this day gets closer, because they know that there is repentance involved
in the Christian life, which they are not too thrilled about because it means
depriving themselves of certain things that they really enjoy and like.  They
know that if they are going to get serious about repentance, then they are not
going to be able to do these things.  By doing this, they are actually making
provision, not for God, but for the flesh if they are thinking that they are
going to put it off until a future point.  </p>

<p>Maybe someone is even at that point where they realize that
this is at least a very dangerous issue and that they would like to be a little
more secure concerning this, so maybe they think that they will have some kind
of conversion, but they want it to be in the future because there are certain
things that they still want and desire.  But God says, &ldquo;Put ye on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh.&rdquo;  This is for each one of
us.  We are not to make provision for the flesh.  </p>

<p>I want to give another word of caution as we look at this
thief.  Yes, God will save people right up until probably the very last minute
of salvation while the door is open in this world, but let us think as if this
is the last day and that we only have one day left.  This day will come.  The
forty days like Jonah gave the Ninevites will come.  In April of 2011, we will
be able to literally say, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and the world will be overthrown.&rdquo; 
This day is not that far off.  We only have about eleven times forty from this
point.</p>

<p>So let us say that we are down to that very last day and then
you go to God because you waited.  You waited.  We are not to say that He would
have saved you earlier; but still, you did not go to Him earnestly or you did
not go to Him beseechingly and crying for mercy.  No, you waited until the last
day and then you pray, &ldquo;O God, have mercy on me!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But guess what?  Nothing happens.  You do not feel any
differently.  You do not see any change.  Of course, we cannot see salvation,
but let us just say that God did not answer your prayer.  Well, now you only
have something like twelve hours left in that day.  </p>

<p>You see, what is wonderful about today is that we can go to
God and beseech Him, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy!&rdquo;  If He turns a silent ear, if we do
not have a response from God and if He does not save us, it is a wonderful
blessing that we still have tomorrow when we can make an appeal once again.  </p>

<p>Anyone who is waiting until right up against the end of time
will have no recourse for appeal.  You are not going to have another day when
the Lord might hear you.  That will be it.  It will all be over.  It will be
done.  </p>

<p>So to encourage anyone who has been going to God, keep
going.  Keep going.  It is a wonderful grace that God has given us that we
still have tomorrow when we can go to Him again.  </p>

<p>We are not appealing unto Caesar, like Paul.  We are
appealing unto the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I prayed yesterday and it seems that You did
not hear me.  I understand why, because You are not obligated or bound to hear
me.  You do not have to save me.  There is no reason in me or anything that I
have done that should make You save me.  If You do destroy me, I can only say
that I deserve this.  But Lord, You are merciful.  You alone have salvation and
You are God.  It is impossible with me, but may You have mercy upon me today
while it is still the day of salvation, because the day is fast coming when it
no longer will be.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you see what a great blessing this is?  Even today if you
pray and nothing happens and you do not become saved today, then think, &ldquo;Thank
God that there is still tomorrow.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
