<p>If everyone could turn to Jonah 3.  We have been looking at
this recently and it says in Jonah 3:1-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey. And
Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose
from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with
sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and
published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor
drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence
that <i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent,
and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw their
works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that
he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it </i>not. </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>We have been looking at this for a few weeks.  One of the
tremendous things that I cannot get over is how God sent Jonah into Nineveh and
how little information God gave Him, how brief the whole declaration of the
Gospel was to the Ninevites, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo; 
Eight English words; that was it.  We do not find any kind of further
validation.  There is no more evidence.  </p>

<p>What did they have to go on?  They only knew that this man
came.  He was a Hebrew, so they could gather that he came from Israel.  The
world of that day that was located around Israel knew that there was Jehovah
God.  Through identification of his nationality, they would associate him with
Jehovah.  </p>

<p>So he would be from the right place.  He would be identified
with the right God, because many nations have their gods.  Deep-down, I think,
men know that a god of wood and stone, decked with silver and gold, is not a
god at all and really cannot save.  </p>

<p>So Jonah was identified with the right God and he came with
the right message, because the Bible tells us that when a prophet comes and he
speaks peaceable things to you, when he speaks, &ldquo;God is love and God loves
everybody and God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life,&rdquo; you can
basically dismiss the prophet because that is not how prophets come.  Prophets
come declaring judgment, declaring the wrath of God, declaring that man is a
sinner and in trouble with God. </p>

<p>So he was declaring the right message.  He did not go into Nineveh,
&ldquo;Oh you Ninevites!  The Lord loves you all!  Turn from your sins!&rdquo;  He did not
say that.  He said, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  A time
reference and a judgment reference; that was it.  We do not have any further
information.  </p>

<p>He could have possibly said other things and God did not
record them.  This is the only thing that God recorded&mdash;one sentence.  One
sentence that contained two ingredients&mdash;time and judgment&mdash;and that was it.  </p>

<p>But that is not the amazing thing.  Yes, it is amazing that
Jonah was thrown overboard from the ship and that a whale swallowed him and that
he was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights and that the whale
vomited him out exactly where he needed to be.  That is amazing.  These are
mighty miracles and it is incredible that God brought all of these events to
pass.  But even more incredible is that the people of Nineveh believed God
through this lone, strange prophet who came with the littlest of information. 
The whole city, from the king on down, repented and believed God.  </p>

<p>That is a mighty miracle of God.  That is enormous, really,
once we understand that these Ninevites were men, just like us.  They were
people, just like the people in Philadelphia, in San Francisco, in all of the
cities that we have today.  They were no different.  God tells us, &ldquo;All have sinned
and fallen short of the glory of God,&rdquo; every human being.  All are sinners,
hard-hearted sinners.  </p>

<p>Do you think that you know somebody who is stubborn and
proud and who would never consider the Gospel because he has such a hard
heart?  Do you think that he is any different than you or I were, or than
anybody else?  </p>

<p>We are all hard-hearted sinners: from the baby who is born,
to the one who is 90 or 100 and dies of a heart attack.  Apart from the grace
of God, we are stubborn.  We are stupid because we think that our way is the
right way.  We are fools.  </p>

<p>All of these things are the character that we have because
we are spiritually dead.  And the Ninevites were not any different than us. 
That is what is so incredible!  That is the miracle!  </p>

<p>Through the Word of God, they believed God.  It did not take
the whole Bible.  It did not take, &ldquo;Okay, that sounds good,&rdquo; as we tell someone
about Genesis 7:4, &ldquo;Yet seven days and God will destroy the world with a flood.&rdquo; 
Then we take them to 2 Peter 3, where God says in the context of the flood, &ldquo;One
day is as a thousand years.&rdquo;  And, coincidentally, God has also opened up the
calendar of history, so from the flood until 2011 is 7,000 years.  And we also
know how God wrote the Bible, that He spoke in parables.  So it is very much in
keeping with the nature of the Bible when He said, &ldquo;Yet seven days, Noah, till
the world be destroyed,&rdquo; that, spiritually, it points to 7,000 years.  The
Bible ties all of this together.  There are verses in the Bible, just like, &ldquo;Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo; and there is absolutely no
difference because they all come from the mouth of God.  </p>

<p>Now, Jonah, personally, carried divine revelation.  But when
we read a verse from the Bible or if someone shares a verse from revelation,
that is also divine revelation.  There is absolutely no difference, and yet, at
least in our surroundings, when we share these verses with people, how many
times do we see the reaction of the Ninevites?  How little do we see that
people believe God and say, &ldquo;Wow!  You mean 2011 is 7,000 years from the flood
and then that is when God is going to destroy the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So you tie together the length of time of the Great
Tribulation, which is 23 years, 8400 days exactly, and you share with them&mdash;plus
this was all done apart from the 7,000-year timeline of the flood&mdash;that May 21<sup>st</sup>
in 2011 is the end of the 23-year Great Tribulation, and that, guess what, in
the Hebrew calendar, that is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month. 
I understand why that does not make an impact, but let us go back to Genesis. 
After seven days, when God shut them in the ark and He brought a flood, it was
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>Do you believe God?  You need more?  Well then, you are not
following in the steps of the Ninevites.  There is more.  There is a great deal
more.  There are books more of evidence, but why do you need more?  Why?  The
Ninevites did not have the luxury of more information that we have.  They only
had this to go on, and they repented.  </p>

<p>So this is what I would like to look at today.  I would like
to look at the Ninevites&rsquo; repentance.  We do not hear it too often, but
remember that the Bible tells us that God commands all men everywhere to
repent&mdash;no exceptions.  This is in Acts 17:30.  He commands all men everywhere
to repent; and by &ldquo;all men,&rdquo; He means every human being.  </p>

<p>So if you are eight years old, you are commanded to repent. 
Or if you are 50 years old, you are commanded to repent.  If you are a male or a
female, it does not matter; you and I are commanded to repent.  </p>

<p>In Mark 1:15, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent
ye, and believe the gospel.</p>

<p>That is exactly what the Ninevites did.  They repented and
believed.  </p>

<p>Or go to Matthew 3:2.  This is John the Baptist whom God is
moving to speak:  </p>

<p class="verse">Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  </p>

<p>Also, in the next chapter, Matthew 4:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  </p>

<p>This is a command; and if there is any command that is
abused, this is it.  Most people put this off, even Christians, maybe
especially Christians, or professing Christians, because they are the ones who
are familiar with the Bible and the Word of God, that God commands everyone,
whether Christian or not, to repent.  Many of the people out there in the world
are not familiar with many of God&rsquo;s commands, but we have the Scripture and we
know what God has said in His Word, which is what He wants us to do, to turn
from the way that we are going and to turn to Him.  </p>

<p>That is repentance; it is turning.  In this case, it would
be turning from a path that leads to destruction, to a path that is following
God&rsquo;s way; and so God wants everyone to turn. </p>

<p>Now, if we go back to Jonah, it says in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>And then we know that they all, from the king on down, were
crying mightily to God and were fasting.  But notice what God does in verse 10,
Jonah 3:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and
he did <i>it </i>not.</p>

<p>God repented in the sense that He turned.  That is what this
word means.  Now, the Bible says that God is not a man that He should repent,
but that means of sin, because He is without sin; He is perfect.  But we do
read, on occasion, that God repented; and here, &ldquo;of the evil.&rdquo;  He fully intended
to destroy the Ninevites; but because they turned from their wicked way, God
also turned from the destruction of the city and the destruction of all of the
people.  So that is what repentance means, to turn.  </p>

<p>Now, we have to be careful, because it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God saw their works&hellip;</p>

<p>And we see here that they were not destroyed, so we have to
be careful and realize that repentance, number one, is a work.  It is a work,
just like anything that people do in obedience to God&rsquo;s commands.  God tells us
to love the poor, to give of ourselves and our money.  Anytime people do this,
it is a work and it is a good work.  Or if God says, &ldquo;Believe; have faith in Christ;
believe on the Lord Jesus,&rdquo; that is a work, because it is a command and any
response to a command is a work.  </p>

<p>This is why the Bible tells us that no man is justified by
works.  Remember that?  Galatians 2:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for
by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  </p>

<p>Now, some people have a wrong understanding of what the Law
is.  They think that it is the Ten Commandments, or they think, maybe, the
first few books of the Bible, the Law of Moses, and yet the whole Bible is the
Law Book.  This is why when we read a command in any other part of the Bible,
we are obligated to obey that as much as something spelled out in the Ten
Commandments.  </p>

<p>So when God tell us to do something, that is out of His Law,
the Law Book, the Bible.  If we do it, it would be a work, a good work; and yet
that work, whatever it is, cannot justify us.  It cannot make us right in His
sight.  We cannot become saved by works.  </p>

<p>In Ephesians 2:8-9, it tells us that we are saved through
faith:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and that not of yourselves&hellip;  </p>

<p>Because it is the faith of Christ and not our faith.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>it is </i>the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should
boast.</p>

<p>And that, of course, is what would happen if we could do
something and bring ourselves salvation.  Well, that would just foster pride. 
We would think that it was goodness, that it was our ability to bring ourself
salvation, and that is contrary to the Gospel of the Bible.  </p>

<p>God gets all of the glory.  He did all the work.  Jesus did
all the work in saving His people and there never can be any instance where
someone whom God has saved can say, &ldquo;Well, I did a little something,&rdquo; whether
it be believing in Christ, accepting Christ, coming down the aisle, or whether
it be repenting and turning from sin.  </p>

<p>Now, the Bible commands, &ldquo;Repent and turn from the way that
you are going,&rdquo; and it is to all of us, &ldquo;Repent and turn.&rdquo;  But repenting and
turning is not going to get us saved in itself.  It is not going to save
anybody, and, actually, repentance itself would have to be a gift from God.  </p>

<p>So we do desire to be obedient to the Word of God, to the
Bible, and we turn, and the Ninevites are a great example of what we should do,
personally, in our lives.  We should turn from what we know is sin, what we
know is wrong, what we have a conscience about.  We feel guilty, and why do we
feel guilty?  Because it is not right.  It is wrong, what we are doing, whether
it is thoughts that we have or whether it is things that we say or whether it
is things that we do; these things are against some law of God.  This is why we
do not feel good; we feel badly about them.  This is why it is this area that
we need to turn from.  </p>

<p>So let us say that we are going to get serious because God
is very earnest and sincere and extremely serious about the events that are
going on today since time is short.  Let us say that we are hearing this, so we
are going to decide to finally get serious, and that means today, if you are
serious.  </p>

<p>If you are thinking, &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; you are not serious.  If
you are thinking, &ldquo;Monday&rdquo; when it is Sunday, you are not serious; because when
Monday comes, then it is &ldquo;Tuesday,&rdquo; and when Tuesday comes, then it is &ldquo;Friday,&rdquo;
a more &ldquo;convenient season,&rdquo; a more convenient time to turn from the sin.  </p>

<p>Why?  Because, &ldquo;I want a little bit more pleasure.  I want
to enjoy it a little longer.  I cannot bear to lose it, but I know that I have
to lose it.  I should not want to get closer and closer to the time of the
Rapture and the end of the hope of salvation, when God shuts the door on May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2001, with these sins.  I know that I have to get rid of them;
however, there is still time.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You know, time, right now, it is wonderful, it is a
blessing, it is a mercy that we have over two years, but it can also be a real
hindrance in our minds if we are thinking, &ldquo;Well, we have some time.  It is not
much time, but we still have time.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How do we deceive ourselves?  And how does Satan deceive
us?  Always, &ldquo;I will do it in the future.  I am agreeing with the Bible, I am
agreeing with the Word of God, and I have to repent.  See, God, I am not
against You.  I want to be right with you; however, not at this moment, not
today.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, God says, &ldquo;Today is the day of salvation.&rdquo;  Today, not
tomorrow.  And so today, that would mean, is the day of repentance.  Today is
the day to turn, knowing, as we were just reading, that it is a work to turn
from sin.  So in turning from that sin, it does not guarantee that I am<span
style='color:red'> </span>going to be saved.  But look at Jonah 3:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
violence that <i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>

<p>You see, there is a possibility.  They did not think, &ldquo;Well,
alright, let us put on sackcloth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you know what sackcloth was?  Well, first, you have to
take off your clothes.  You have to take off your garments.  And at times in
the Bible when someone was faced with problems and grief and mourning, they
would rend their clothes and put on sackcloth.  And sackcloth was exactly how
it sounds.  It was a sack that they would put food in.  It is the same word
that is found in Genesis with the historical story of Joseph and his brethren
when they went to Egypt to get corn.  Well, the corn was put in their sacks,
and that is the word &ldquo;sackcloth.&rdquo;  And that sack would probably be cut or
ripped somehow and then you would put it over you and you would wear
sackcloth.  And this is what God is indicating that these individuals in the
city of Nineveh were doing, from the king on down.  </p>

<p>Now, the king was king, and he took off his royal robe; he
put it aside.  So if any of us think that we are too good for sackcloth, well,
we should take a little history lesson from the King of Nineveh.  He was not so
proud that he could not put aside his royal robe, and he covered himself in
sackcloth and sat in ashes, just like everybody else.  </p>

<p>In itself, historically, this did not mean anything, but God
is teaching us by this that this is a sign or an indicator that these people
meant business and that they were broken.  They were broken by the Word of God
and they were truly believing God and turning from their sins.  </p>

<p>By the way, we also know that the only people who will hear
the Word of God and respond to the Word of God are the true believers.  God commands
all men everywhere to repent, but only the elect are going to repent, only God&rsquo;s
chosen people will be given ears to hear and understand the day that we are
living in.  They will turn from the way they are going because God is going to
make sure of this.  </p>

<p>For instance, if we go to 2 Peter 3, right after the verse
about one day is as a thousand years, we read in verse 9, 2 Peter 3:9:</p>

<p class="verse">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish,
but that all should come to repentance.</p>

<p>We just cannot leave this verse as it is&mdash;that is, without
commenting on it&mdash;because many people abuse this verse and try to go here to
say, &ldquo;Well, this means that God is going to save everyone, because He is not
willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.&rdquo;  But,
no, that cannot be, because the Bible in many places elsewhere teaches us that
the vast majority of men will perish.  Most people of the human race will die
and experience an eternal destruction and will come to their end.  Only those
whom God has chosen, those whom Christ has saved and died for, they will not
perish.  Every one of them, all of them, should come to repentance; every
single one of God&rsquo;s people will come to repentance.  </p>

<p>So we know that today, as God is saving a great multitude
from around the world outside of the churches, this means that a great
multitude are going to experience repentance, turning from their sins.  We do
not know who they are.  We do not know even exactly where they are.  But they
are out there in the world and they are hearing the Gospel and God is going to
give them the gift of repentance.  He is going to turn them so that they may,
in turn, turn from their sins, or as a result, turn from the sins, and begin
crying out to God.  God will hear and He will save, because this is the day
that we are living in when this great multitude, tens of millions of people,
are becoming saved.  Therefore, they are repenting and they are turning from
their sins.  </p>

<p>Okay, let us go back to Jonah and look at the character of
the Ninevites&rsquo; repentance in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>At first, they proclaimed a fast.  If we go to 2 Chronicles
20:2-4, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and,
behold, they <i>be </i>in Hazazontamar, which <i>is </i>Engedi.  And
Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek JEHOVAH, and proclaimed a fast
throughout all Judah.  And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask <i>help </i>of
JEHOVAH: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>To proclaim a fast, we know, in itself, is worthless.  It
has no benefit, spiritually.  You can stop eating for any length of time and
that is not going to help you.  We also know, spiritually, that God uses
fasting as a type and picture of sending the Gospel out, because we read this
in Isaiah 58.  So that would be one of the spiritual dimensions or ideas behind
fasting.  </p>

<p>But here in 2 Chronicles 20, Jehoshaphat proclaimed a fast
in order to seek Jehovah and to seek His help, because there was a great army coming
whom they feared.  They were afraid that they would be destroyed by this great
army, and so they proclaimed a fast in order to go to God, seeking the Lord for
His help, exactly like the Ninevites heard that they were going to be destroyed
so they proclaimed a fast to seek God and His help.  </p>

<p>There is another verse.  If we go to Daniel 9:3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</p>

<p>And then it goes on to describe his prayer.  But, you see,
he is seeking, by prayer and fasting, the face of the Lord.  He is seeking God,
and we are looking for the true teaching of what God is saying in Jonah,
because we know that God does not want us to say, &ldquo;Oh, we only have so much
time left, so let me rip off my clothes and find a sackcloth and put it on and
walk around with ashes.&rdquo;  God does not want us to do this.  He does not want us
to do this today, but He does want us to do what this spiritually represents.  </p>

<p>Holding a fast, yes, is getting the Gospel out, but what if
you are not a believer?  What if you are not a believer?  These Ninevites were
not believers.  So were they to, spiritually, send the Gospel out?  </p>

<p>Well, as soon as someone becomes saved, yes, but a part of
fasting, also, is seeking the Lord, seeking the Lord, and that was definitely
what they were doing.  They were crying mightily to God so that He might have
mercy on them.  They were seeking His help.  </p>

<p>I think God gives us another picture of the deeper,
spiritual meaning in the book of Joel, in Joel 2:12-14, where He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore also now, saith JEHOVAH, turn ye <i>even </i>to me
with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And
rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto JEHOVAH your God: for he <i>is
</i>gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth
him of the evil. Who knoweth <i>if </i>he will return and repent, and leave a
blessing behind him&hellip;</p>

<p>You see, it is very similar to the Ninevites, except do not
bother with your clothes.  Please, keep your wardrobe in tact.  Do not bother
with ripping your clothes.  The problem is not outward anyway.  The problem is
inward; it is the heart.  It is the heart, and that is where repentance has to
come from.  </p>

<p>Yes, you can put away cigarettes and drinking and cursing
and lying and stealing and adulterous thoughts, and on and on and on and on. 
However, all sin flows out of the heart and if you cut off the outward sin&mdash;you throw
away the pack of cigarettes or you throw away whatever it is that is
outward&mdash;that is good, that is good, that is a good thing to do and we need to
do that, but that is not salvation and that is not true repentance because the
problem is deep-down in the spiritual nature of man, in the heart.  We must
turn from our own heart, as it says here, &ldquo;Rend your heart.&rdquo;  Break your heart
and give yourself a new heart, as God says elsewhere, &ldquo;Circumcise your heart;
cut off your own heart.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Can you do it?  Can you do it?  Can I do it?  Can anybody do
it?  Has anybody ever done it?  No, not of themselves; that is another reason
why repentance, in itself, cannot save us.  We can cut off all these outward
things and it would be a very wise thing for us to do.  Get rid of them.  Turn
off the TV.  Turn off all of these things that are wasting your time and go to
God and say, &ldquo;Lord, I know that You command me to repent and I am trying.  I am
putting forth effort.  I am striving to enter into the strait gate.  I am
really troubled by the information that I am learning from the Bible that the
end is coming; however, I can only go so far and I know that.  Nothing I do can
ever save me anyway, so I ask that You might give me true repentance and that
You might give me a new heart and a new spirit that desires to do the will of
God, that cannot sin.&rdquo;  It cannot sin, so that is repentance.  It is turned
from all evil.  It is turned from all wickedness.  It is a pure and perfect
heart that, now, is perfectly in line with God&rsquo;s will and His Word, and that is
what God is going to give every one of His elect.  They will all come to
repentance.  Each and every one will receive that heart.  </p>

<p>Okay, let us also look at sackcloth.  I think I am running
out of time here, but sackcloth has a lot to do with mourning, sadness.  For
instance, when Jacob heard that his son, Joseph, was killed by beasts, he put
on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.  He even said that he would go
down to the grave mourning for his son.  So it was an expression of grief and
of terrible sadness and of mourning.  </p>

<p>Or in the book of Esther, they heard that they were going to
be destroyed, just like we have heard it.  We have heard that we are going to
be destroyed, and so did the Jews in the days of Mordecai and Esther, and it
says in Esther 4:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; And came even before the king&rsquo;s
gate: for none <i>might </i>enter into the king&rsquo;s gate clothed with sackcloth. And
in every province, whithersoever the king&rsquo;s commandment and his decree came, <i>there
was </i>great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing;
and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>You can see how all of these ingredients are what the
Ninevites were also doing, and this is very similar to our case.  They knew the
date.  They knew the date because the lot was cast.  The destruction was
decreed and announced and made known to everybody.  All the Jews knew, &ldquo;I am
gong to perish at the end of the year.  On a particular date, I am going to
die.&rdquo;  And look at their reaction.  Look at how they responded, because
Mordecai and these Jews represent Christ and the true believers.  </p>

<p>Everyone whom God saves will come to repentance.  So, in
other words, to put on sackcloth has to do with mourning for our sins, mourning
for our sins.  As David said, &ldquo;I am sorry for my sins.&rdquo;  Or as we read in the
New Testament, in 2 Corinthians 7, where the Apostle Paul was moved to write a
letter; and by that letter, people were made sorry.  Let us read that.  In 2
Corinthians 7:8-10, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry,
though <i>it were </i>but for a season. Now I rejoice, not that ye were made
sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly
manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh
repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world
worketh death.</p>

<p>So as we read the Bible, we hear the commands of God, and by
the writings of Christ, we are made sorry.  We are troubled, we mourn, we are
sad.  </p>

<p>Now, nobody likes that, and the Apostle Paul even said, &ldquo;I
am sorry, but I rejoice because you sorrowed to repentance,&rdquo; and this is the
ultimate thing.  This is the thing that we need to keep in our eyesight at all
times, which is that there is an eternal blessing straight ahead.  It is near
to come, and, yes, there is great sadness and sorrow, as far as bringing this
message of the Gospel to the world, but there is also great joy, because God is
going to save many and God&rsquo;s people can be comforted, they can be encouraged.  </p>

<p>God says, &ldquo;If you are hearing the Gospel and if you know
that you are not saved or if you think that you are not saved or if there is
evidence in your life that shows that you may not be saved, it is far better to
mourn.&rdquo;  Read the Bible and pray to God, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, O Lord.&rdquo;  Cry out
like the Ninevites.  Cry mightily to God that He might save you and give you a
new heart; because if it does happen, if God does save you, in Psalm 30:10-11,
He addresses this:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hear, O JEHOVAH, and have mercy upon me: JEHOVAH, be thou my
helper. Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</p>

<p>You see, we stay in sackcloth.  We stay in that situation. 
We are never told how long the Ninevites remained in that condition.  Did they
do it one day?  Did they do it all forty days?  Did they continue after that? 
God does not want us to know.  He just gives us this historical picture and He
says, &ldquo;Look, they are crying unto Me and I do hear them and I did save them. Spiritually,
they did take off their sackcloth; and, spiritually, as it says here, their
mourning was changed into dancing or into rejoicing, into joy, because I did
save them.&rdquo;  And that is how it should be with each one of us.  We should wait
for God to remove the sackcloth, wait for Him to give us the comfort for our
heaviness.  </p>

<p>Alright, let us stop here.  </p>
