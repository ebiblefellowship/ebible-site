title: What Should We Do With Our Last Few Months
summary: |
  Today we have 243 days remaining until May 21, 2011.  If you are
  wondering how long this period of time is or how quickly this period
  of time can go, the eight-month period of time from January 1, 2010
  to August 31, 2010 is exactly 243 days, which is what we have remaining.

<p>Today we have 243 days remaining until May 21, 2011.  If you are wondering how long this period of time is or how quickly this period of time
can go, the eight-month period of time from January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2010 is
exactly 243 days, which is what we have remaining.  So we see that from the
beginning of the new year, it was not that long ago.  </p>

<p>Maybe the children can remember what they did this past New
Year&rsquo;s Day.  Maybe they remember looking ahead to their school year, which was
last year, and then looking at the end of the year into summer and thinking
about vacation.  </p>

<p>It is all gone now.  It is all past, and this is exactly
what is going to happen with the next 243 days.  It is going to go quickly and it
will pass just as surely as these last eight months have passed.  </p>

<p>After reading the &ldquo;May 21, 2011 Judgment Day!&rdquo; tract,
someone wrote us and asked what I think is such a great question.  This is all
he said: &ldquo;What does God want me to do?&rdquo;  This is a good question: &ldquo;What does
God want me to do?&rdquo;  He heard about Judgment Day being May 21, 2011, and this is an excellent response: &ldquo;What does God want me to do?&rdquo;  What should I do with
my time from now until then?  </p>

<p>Well, I think that we find the answer to his question in the
Bible.  If we turn to Jonah 3, I think that this is an appropriate response for
this question because the Ninevites were in a very similar situation as each
one of us.  God had sent Jonah to Nineveh and here is what happened.  We read
in Jonah 3:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I
bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an <span class="underline">exceeding great</span> city of three days&rsquo; journey. 
</p>

<p>By the way, &ldquo;exceeding great&rdquo; in the Hebrew of the
Interlinear Bible literally reads, &ldquo;Nineveh was a great city to God&rdquo;; and, of
course, if it was a great city to God, it was an &ldquo;exceeding great city.&rdquo;  Why
was Nineveh a great city to God?  It was because He had much people there, and
He will demonstrate this later on in the chapter.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>This is all of the recorded message that we have from
Jonah.  God did not indicate that Jonah said anything else; at least He did not
record it.  But from all we know, we could speculate that Jonah repeated this
message, and he probably did.  We could maybe say that he said some other
things, but we cannot be sure.  We do know that he said this, and what he said
was very short and not too sweet.  It was a little bitter.  It was sweet
because it is the Word of God, but it was also a bitter message containing
information concerning two things: time and judgment.  As we know, God has said
in Ecclesiastes, &ldquo;A wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth [<i>understands</i>] both time
and judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we look at this statement in Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>The time reference is the forty days.  Then what comes is
the judgment that Nineveh will be overthrown.  </p>

<p>This means, if they would have had a calendar like we have
today, they could have marked forty days later and circled the date.  Right? 
They could have circled the date.  This would mean that they would have known
the year, the month, and the day, and they would have known this precisely
according to the information that God had given them through His prophet
Jonah.  </p>

<p>This is the exact same thing that we can do today.  Has
anyone done this on their calendar at home?  Have you circled May 21 or
indicated something about this date?  </p>

<p>I saw a good calendar that someone had developed for the
year 2011.  He had all the days leading up to May 21.  This date was basically
highlighted.  Then all of the days for five more months were in red.  Then the
calendar ended after October 21, 2011 because there will be time no more. 
There were no more days on the calendar, no more future days after that.  This
would be a good calendar to give out for the coming year.  I might take his
calendar to see if I can get this copied.  </p>

<p>So we can go to our calendar and we can do exactly what the Ninevites
could have done if they would have had calendars.  We can know the very day. 
This at least shows us that God has set a precedent and that it is not all that
unusual to know the very day.  Right?  </p>

<p>He did this with the Ninevites.  Whom else did He do this
with?  He also did this with the people of the world of Noah&rsquo;s day.  God said
to Noah, &ldquo;Yet seven days and I will destroy the world with a flood&rdquo;; and so
Noah could have marked his calendar.  Noah&rsquo;s calendar was based on his own
lifespan.  It was in the 600<sup>th</sup> year of Noah&rsquo;s life and on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, which, as we have learned, will also be May
21.  In the Hebrew calendar, May 21 is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  </p>

<p>The first thing that we can see is God&rsquo;s mercy and graciousness;
and so by God&rsquo;s mercy, we can see that God has worked this way in times past. 
He has set a precedent and a Biblical pattern, and He says that He will do
nothing without first warning His servants.  </p>

<p>Why warn His servants, the prophets?  Why do this?  He has
promised to do this because they are prophets and they are to speak forth the
Word of God.  It is because they are watchmen and they are to blow the
trumpet.  They will, in turn, warn the world.  Therefore, He does nothing
without first warning His people, who then will warn as many as they can get
the word out to.  </p>

<p>So after God moved Jonah to say, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown,&rdquo; it goes on to say in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word for &ldquo;people&rdquo; is better translated &ldquo;men.&rdquo; 
Overwhelmingly, dozens if not several hundred times at least, this is
translated as &ldquo;men&rdquo; in the Hebrew of the Old Testament.  It is the Hebrew word <i>&lsquo;enowsh</i>
and it is the typical Hebrew word for &ldquo;men.&rdquo;  In one place, this is translated
as &ldquo;persons&rdquo; where we read that &ldquo;Abimelech hired vain and light persons.&rdquo;  The
word for &ldquo;persons&rdquo; is this same Hebrew word <i>&lsquo;enowsh</i>.  He would have
hired men because he wanted soldiers and women were not soldiers at that time. 
This is the only other instance that I could see in the Interlinear where this
word was translated in the form of &ldquo;people.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Also, remember what Jesus said in Matthew 12:41:  </p>

<p class="verse">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation&hellip; 
 </p>

<p>He does not say &ldquo;people&rdquo;; He says &ldquo;men,&rdquo; but I am not going
to say that only men were saved.  </p>

<p>Again, it says in Jonah 3:5:    </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh [<i>or the men of </i><i>Nineveh</i>]
believed God, and proclaimed a fast&hellip;    </p>

<p>The reason that this says &ldquo;men&rdquo; is because it would take
some authority to do this and women would not have proclaimed a fast.  It is
the men of Nineveh who would have proclaimed a fast, but there are instances in
the Bible where a fast is proclaimed that includes men, women, and children.  </p>

<p>So God, for whatever purpose, is focusing on the fact that
the men of Nineveh heard this and responded.  We see that this was from the
king on down and that a fast was proclaimed.  But I would think that God saved
all sorts of people, not just the men.  There is no reason for why God would
only save men, but it is the word &ldquo;men&rdquo; here in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the [<i>men</i>] of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a
fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of
them.  </p>

<p>Here we see one thing that we should do.  Remember that the
question was: what should I do?  Or as the question was put: &ldquo;What does God
want me to do?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, here in Jonah, we see at least five responses, five
things that they did.  However, I would not say that this is a formula.  There
is no formula.  There are no one-two-three steps that we can take; however,
these are things that the Ninevites did that we can learn from, as God moved
them to take action after warning them of judgment.  We know that if anyone
responds in a God-pleasing way, it is because God moved in them &ldquo;to will and to
do of <i>his </i>good pleasure.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Did the thief on the cross respond as the Ninevites did?  In
some ways, yes; but in other ways, no.  God works individually with people.  He
works with one person maybe in a different way than He does with another.  </p>

<p>But here we do see that the Ninevites had this response, and
this was a pleasing response.  It was a good response in this sense, but their response
to what should they do, as they heard of Judgment Day for them and were made
aware of the very day, in no way saved them.  In no way did their response
contribute to their salvation, but what it did was that it did not hinder God&rsquo;s
plan at all.  This is the important thing.  The important thing is that it did
not stop God.  </p>

<p>First of all, we read again in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the [<i>men</i>] of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>So this did not save them.  It did not save them to believe
God, but it is far better to believe God than to disbelieve God.  This is because
it is right there at that point that you can stop if you disbelieve God.  If
you did not think that there is any possibility of May 21 being Judgment Day,
would you then move on to the next thing that follows?  Would you involve
yourself in a fast or sit in sackcloth and ashes?  Would you cry mightily to
God?  Would you wait on Him?  No, you would not do any of this, and yet God
could still save someone who does not believe this.  </p>

<p>The thief on the cross is a good example of someone who could
not care less about the Gospel, and yet God still saved Him.  God is gracious in
this way, but it is not a positive thing for someone to disbelieve the Word of
God and what He says in His Word concerning Judgment Day.  There is nothing
positive about this at all because they are actually placing themselves in a
position where they are going away from God.  </p>

<p>We know that God is going to save a great multitude. 
However, He is going to condemn far more, and He just might permit you to
continue in unbelief.  Therefore, it is not a wise thing at all to not believe
that this is the date of judgment.  </p>

<p>So let us just quickly look at the word &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in order
to get something straight.  We read in John 8:30, referring to Jesus:  </p>

<p class="verse">As he spake these words, many believed on him.  </p>

<p>This says that &ldquo;many believed.&rdquo;  Okay, that is fine;
however, this is not salvation because these exact same people had their &ldquo;belief&rdquo;
develop into what Jesus said in John 8:47:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>Why would Jesus say that they are not hearing Him when this
began with them indicating that they &ldquo;believed on him&rdquo;?  It is because
intellectual belief is not what He is looking for.  It is not ultimately what
God is looking for.  </p>

<p>Then John 8:48 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  </p>

<p>They believed and then they were saying that Jesus was a
Samaritan and that He had a devil.  Therefore, this kind of belief is not
salvation.  Obviously, when people come to the point of saying that Jesus had a
devil, they were never saved.  It did not matter what they thought or what they
professed with their mouths.  A belief like this is not saving faith.  </p>

<p>Go also to John 12:42.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him&hellip;    </p>

<p>Of course they did.  Look at all of the miracles that Christ
did.  He raised the dead.  He gave sight to several blind people.  He gave the
lame man legs.  Repeatedly and all through His ministry, He did tremendous and
mighty miracles.  </p>

<p>The Jews knew that only somebody of God could do these
things.  Do you remember when Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a ruler of the Jews,
came to Jesus by night?  Did Nicodemus not say this?  He said to Christ, &ldquo;We
know that thou art a teacher come from God.  Nicodemus said, &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;we know&rdquo;;
it was not just Nicodemus.  The rulers knew.  They had to have known; but
still, this just shows us the depths of pride within man that they valued their
religious system more than they valued pleasing God Himself.  </p>

<p>We continue on to read in John 12:42-43:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him, </i>lest they should
be put out of the synagogue: For they loved the praise of men more than the
praise of God.  </p>

<p>This just sums it up and tells us why.  They valued
synagogue membership more than membership in the eternal Kingdom of God.  They
valued what their spiritual leaders or their chief Levitical priest would say
about them more than what God would say about them.  </p>

<p>Another place that we can turn to where we can see that
belief is not salvation is in the book of James.  In this chapter, God is
trying to teach us this very thing, that faith without works is dead, as it
says in James 2:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even so faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>In this case, this is referring to a profession of belief. 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. </p>

<p>Many people understand this a certain way and what they try
to do is they try to support their faith by their works.  Therefore, they do
good deeds; they do works.  In and of themselves, the works that they do could
even be pleasing to God; for example, giving money to support the Gospel,
sending out the Gospel in whatever way, sharing tracts.  These are all good
works; but the moment someone begins trusting in their work to any degree, then
it becomes an evil work; it becomes an evil thing in God&rsquo;s sight and God is not
pleased with it.  </p>

<p>So what is God saying in James 2:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.  </p>

<p>Well, the next verse goes on to tell us, as the &ldquo;man&rdquo; here
in James 2:18 that is speaking is Christ:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is referring to Jesus.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is speaking to about two billion professing Christians
in our day.  Do they not all claim that they have faith?  </p>

<p>Jesus is saying in James 2:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without
thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.  </p>

<p>He is saying that He has works, but it is not the works of
man that He is referring to.  The Bible tells us that &ldquo;all our righteousnesses <i>are
</i>as filthy rags&rdquo; and that &ldquo;man is not justified by the works of the law.&rdquo; 
We are justified &ldquo;by the faith of Christ.&rdquo;  Faith is a work, and so we could
equally understand that we are justified by the work of Christ.  We are not
justified by our work in any way.  </p>

<p>So Jesus is saying, &ldquo;Okay, you have a profession of faith. 
You say that you are a Christian, but I am the One who did the work of paying
for the sins of My elect people, of each and every one of them.  So if you say
you have faith but you lack the work that I did on behalf of My people, this
means that your faith is in vain and it does not matter what you do.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It does not matter because if Jesus did not die for your
sins, then you have a vain and empty profession of faith.  This is the whole
idea of what God wants us to know about believing.  Believing is a positive
thing, but it cannot save anyone.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in James 2:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well&hellip;  </p>

<p>See, it is a good thing.  However, it continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the devils also believe, and tremble.  </p>

<p>The devils believe likewise.  We read where the devils said,
&ldquo;I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.&rdquo;   Many times the devils
recognized Jesus.  That is belief.  They knew who He was.  </p>

<p>Why bring up the devils at this point?  I am doing this
because their profession of belief could never possibly save them, because
Jesus did no works on their behalf.  He did not pay for the sins of any of the
fallen angels.  Therefore, what the devils believe means nothing, does it?  How
much different are we than devils?  They rebelled against God.  </p>

<p>By the way, some people try to say that God is not just,
that He is not fair because He is going to destroy unsaved mankind.  They
wonder why He does not just save everyone.  However, these same people are not
upset over God&rsquo;s destruction of the devils and all of these demons.  They would
say, &ldquo;Good.  I am glad.  They deserve what they are going to get.  Destroy
them!&rdquo;  This is because they are guilty.  After all, look at all of the misery
that they have brought into the world due to Satan&rsquo;s evil desire of wanting to
be like God.  </p>

<p>We have no pity for the fallen angels, do we?  We do not
think that it is a shame that God has not provided salvation for them.  We
really are able to look objectively and we are able to see that it is a right
and a just thing for God to destroy all of the fallen angels, and yet we are
not so objective when it comes to mankind.  When it comes to mankind, we think
that God is not fair and that He is not being just in destroying unsaved man. 
But no; it is the same thing.  </p>

<p>We rebelled just like the angels did.  If God destroys any
person, He would be just to do so.  But here in James, He is bringing up the
fallen angels or the devils as an example because He provided no work on their
behalf of any kind.  Therefore, any fallen angel can say all day long that they
believe, but it will not change their fate.  </p>

<p>It is likewise with us.  We can say over and over again, &ldquo;I
believe; I believe.&rdquo;  On that Day, many will say, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo;  This is
basically indicating that they believe, but then they also go on to tell God
about their works.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 7.  This is a passage that is going to take
place very shortly.  We read in Matthew 7:21-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name?&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a work.  They continue:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and in thy name have cast out devils?&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a work; and they continue:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and in thy name done many wonderful works?  </p>

<p>These works did not help them at all.  They are left
behind.  The door has been shut and the cry is going out, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo;  But
faith without &ldquo;works&rdquo; is dead.  They are saying, &ldquo;Here are my works; here is my
faith!&rdquo;  However, they are not given entry into Heaven.  </p>

<p>This was the same mistake that Cain made when he was
trusting in his own works, whereas Abel&rsquo;s works were righteous because it was
the work of Christ.  God makes a distinction between Cain and Abel and He will
make a distinction between all believers on May 21, the true believers and the
professing believers.  This is why we say &ldquo;true believers&rdquo; so often.  It is
because there are so many who say that they are believers, and yet it is not
true.  God will make this known on that Day who really were His true
believers.  </p>

<p>Well, you see, this is one thing that we should do.  We
should believe that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  Believe it because it is. 
This is one good reason to believe this.  However, people hem and haw, &ldquo;I am
studying the issue.&rdquo;  But while they are continuing to do something that they
have been doing for who knows how long, while they are continuing to mull this
over, how long are they going to take?  It is like God said through the prophet
Elijah, &ldquo;How long halt ye between two opinions?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is exactly what is going on as they continue to study
this issue and as they are continuing to be undecided.  They just continue to
say, &ldquo;I am not sure.&rdquo;  But they are halting.  They are doubting and they are
not believing, but God says to believe.  </p>

<p>We read in Mark 1:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at
hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  </p>

<p>Believe it!  Repent and believe the Gospel.  The time is
here.  How much more time do you want?  Well, you have the reality of only so
much time left.  You may want a lot more time; but this is it, so believe it. 
This is a good first step in what we should do.  We should believe it.  This is
because then the other steps that the Ninevites took, as God moved them to do
so, can follow.  </p>

<p>Unbelief is more than likely why people do halt between two
opinions.  They do delay.  They do say, &ldquo;What about 1994?  Let us talk about
1994.  It did not happen back then, and so why would it happen now?&rdquo;  You tell
them and you lay it all out.  You show them from the Bible how God has
confirmed May 21, 2011 in a way that He never did in 1994.  Then you tell them,
&ldquo;This is going to happen,&rdquo; and they say, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;  Then the next time you see
them, they tell you that they are now undecided about another issue, like the
five months, &ldquo;I am trying to determine if this is literal or not.&rdquo;  So then you
tell them how God has laid this out in the Bible, and they seem to listen and
they seem to understand.  But then there is another issue that comes up,
because it is always something.  </p>

<p>There is always something that is preventing them from
believing this.  This is because as long as they do not believe this, then, of
course, they are not going to respond with a sense of urgency.  They are not
going to take action in the way that God moved the Ninevites to take action. 
This is one thing that we can see.  </p>

<p>We cannot help it if we have doubts.  This is true.  If we
turn to Mark 9, we find a good prayer in relation to this.  This is the father
of a child who had been afflicted for a long period of time.  Let us start in
verse 21 where Jesus is speaking.  We read in Mark 9:21-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
him? And he said, Of a child. And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and
into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
compassion on us, and help us. Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all
things <i>are </i>possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of
the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine
unbelief.  </p>

<p>This would be an excellent prayer for us to make.  &ldquo;O Lord,
I see what You are saying.  I believe; but if I have any doubts, &lsquo;help thou mine
unbelief.&rsquo;&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Again, just to reiterate this, belief will not save us. 
This is not going to save us.  Belief is just a right reaction to the
information that God is opening up at this time.  We should believe it and
trust it.  The Bible says, &ldquo;Trust in the LORD with all thine heart,&rdquo; not 90% of
your heart.  No, we are to &ldquo;trust in the LORD with <span class="underline">all</span> thine heart; and
lean not unto thine own understanding.&rdquo;  Lean not upon your own questions and
your own doubts.  </p>

<p>We can pick something apart in a thousand different ways if
we have a mind to.  Could the Ninevites not have picked apart the message from
Jonah if they would have had a mind to?  Yes, they could have and in a thousand
different ways.  </p>

<p>It is really pretty simple.  You just get that look on your
face and you say, &ldquo;Does anybody in the city of Nineveh know this man Jonah?&rdquo; 
They would say, &ldquo;No, he is a stranger.&rdquo;  Then you would ask, &ldquo;Are you going to
trust a stranger?  Are you going to listen to a stranger?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Okay, so he is a
stranger.  Where is he from?&rdquo;  Someone would say, &ldquo;He is from Israel,&rdquo; to which
you would respond, &ldquo;He is from Israel!  He is from our enemy!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know that the Assyrians did have wars with Israel.  From
this point, you could work yourself and others up over this as you thought
about the fact that he was an enemy, &ldquo;He is an enemy.  He is not for us; He is
against us!&rdquo;  You could then travel along this track for quite some time.  </p>

<p>Someone could also ask, &ldquo;What about our own religious
people?  We have religious people here in Nineveh.  Has anybody ever heard of
what he is talking about, forty days and then we will be destroyed?  Let us
check with our own religious people.  After all, we are just as holy as those
Israelites.  We have our own connection with God.  We also have contact with
God, and yet we have not heard anything in our religion about a coming Judgment
Day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Anyone can go on and on and on if they have a mind to. 
Right?  If you are of a mind to, you can pick apart any truth in the Bible, and
people do this all of the time.  For example, they do this to the doctrine of
election.  They also do this concerning the fact that Christ is God and the
Father is God.  How many people could go to the Bible and find verses that say,
&ldquo;God is one&rdquo; and yet they find that the Father is talking to the Son.  People
say this all the time, &ldquo;Are you trying to tell me that they are One?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, if you want to think this way and if you want to be a
critic and a cynic, if you want to doubt, then you can wind up doubting
everything that you read in the Bible.  Some people even doubt that it is the
Word of God.  If you want, you can go this way and you can pick it apart;
however, not actually.  You can only do this in your own mind.  Likewise, we
can do the same with May 21, 2011.  We can come up with a thousand reasons not
to believe.  </p>

<p>All someone really has to do is go to their pastor and ask, &ldquo;Have
you heard about Family Radio?  Have you heard about May 21, 2011?&rdquo;  The pastor will respond, &ldquo;Do not listen to them,&rdquo; and then he will give them a hundred
reasons why they should not believe this.  It does not matter if it is an elder
or a deacon, the whole congregation will help them in unbelief.  </p>

<p>You see, this is our problem.  We have an &ldquo;evil heart of
unbelief.&rdquo;  Therefore, we cannot trust ourself.   We cannot even trust any
man.  We are living in that time when the Bible says that &ldquo;every brother will
utterly supplant.&rdquo;  We only trust the Word of God, the Bible, and the Bible
tells us to believe.  </p>

<p>This is the first thing that the Ninevites did, so let us go
back to Jonah 3:5 again.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>They did not believe Jonah.  This does not say that they
believed Jonah.  This says that they believed God.  </p>

<p>People say, &ldquo;You believe Mr. Camping.&rdquo;  We hear this a lot. 
&ldquo;You believe Mr. Camping because you listen to Family Radio.&rdquo;  No, we believe
God.  We believe God and God uses His servants the prophets.  He first warns His
servants the prophets and then He uses them.  What does a prophet do?  The
prophets are all of God&rsquo;s people and they are to declare the Word of God.  </p>

<p>This is what God&rsquo;s people are doing today.  Family Radio is
declaring the Word of God.  Mr. Camping is declaring the Word of God, and we
trust the Word of God that they are declaring because we have checked these
things out and we have seen that these things are true and that it is going to
happen.  </p>

<p>It says in Jonah 3:5 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>This is the second thing that God would have us to do.  It
is to allow this message to interrupt our life.  The Ninevites had lives just
like we do.  They were people just like we are.  They had plans.  It is the
nature of man to plan for the future, to think of what he is going to do; but
God came with a message of &ldquo;time and judgment.&rdquo;  Number one, they believed. 
Secondly, they did not continue on as normal.  </p>

<p>If we look at Matthew 24, we read of the days of Noah.  It
says in Matthew 24:37-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>What is wrong with eating and drinking?  The Bible says that
John the Baptist &ldquo;came neither eating nor drinking,&rdquo; and yet they said of him, &ldquo;He
hath a devil.&rdquo;  Then the Bible says that the Son of man &ldquo;came eating and
drinking,&rdquo; and they spoke badly of Him.  It was the same &ldquo;eating and drinking.&rdquo; 
There is nothing wrong with eating and drinking.  We have to do this to live. 
But the point that God is making is that when the Ninevites fasted, they
stopped eating and drinking.  Instead, they allowed the message to interrupt
their lives.  </p>

<p>Likewise, it says again in Matthew 24:38:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark,  </p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with marrying and giving in
marriage?  No, there is nothing wrong with this.  God has established and
ordained the marriage relationship, even though He did set some guidelines.  If
we are a believer, we are to marry in the Lord.  We are not to divorce and
remarry.  There are guidelines within the marriage relationship, but there is
nothing wrong with marrying and giving in marriage.  </p>

<p>If you want to get married, that is fine.  There is nothing
wrong with this unless you are scheduling your wedding day for May 21, 2011, which happens to be on a Saturday.  May is a nice month for weddings.  However,
if you have your wedding scheduled for May 21, this is a problem.  You now have
a problem because, first of all, all of the work and all of the preparation
that goes into a wedding is what you are going to be focused on.  Secondly, you
have scheduled your wedding at the time that God is going to bring judgment on
this world.  This indicates that you do not believe, and so you need to go back
to step one.  </p>

<p>If you have plans for a future career, if you are making
plans for college, if you are making plans for anything, like your retirement
where you are looking off into the distance, and yet you are fully aware that
God is indicating that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day, then you do not believe. 
Maybe you even think that you believe this.  Maybe you are not even doing this
consciously; I do not know.  Maybe you are even telling your children that you
believe this; but when you are making plans for a future that the Bible tells
us will not be here, then you are indicating that you do not believe it.  Your
children will see this and they will, of course, think, &ldquo;If you do not believe
this, why should I believe it?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So from all of the people whom this message comes to, there
needs to be a response to this.  There needs to be action taken.  Intellectual
understanding does not mean anything.  It does not mean a thing.  According to Job
28:28, &ldquo;To depart from evil <i>is </i>understanding&rdquo;; and so this should certainly
impact our lives in the things that we are saying and doing.  </p>

<p>Look also at Luke 17:26-28.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were
given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they
did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  </p>

<p>It was life as normal, life as usual, which is the typical
response from an unbeliever who will perish in the judgment of God.  They do
not take action.  They just go about their daily business, which at any other
time in history is perfectly fine.  However, this declaration and this
information requires and demands a response from the hearer.  This is why a lot
of people do not like this.  </p>

<p>For centuries in Christianity, you could make a profession. 
It certainly appeared that this profession was all that was required of
anyone.  However, now God is requiring something from all people.  The Bible
tells us, &ldquo;He hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world.&rdquo; 
Because of this, it says that God &ldquo;now commandeth all men every where to
repent.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>To repent and to turn would be the third thing.  I do not
think that we are going to have time to get into all five things that I have to
talk about.  Number one is to believe it.  Number two is that we have to let this
impact our life.  We cannot continue living out our lives as though we are
living in the seventeenth century or the nineteenth century or the twentieth
century.  This is the last century, the last time for us.  We are winding down
and we need to have an appropriate response.  </p>

<p>This is just like an individual who goes to a doctor and the
doctor tells him that he has a terminal illness and that he is going to die. 
How does this person take this information?  He may check things out thoroughly
before he believes it.  But then, since he has confidence in the doctors who
have shown him the proof, he realizes that these things are so.  </p>

<p>Will this person continue living his life just as he had in
the past, or will this information change him?  Will this information impact
him to such a degree that he realizes that he does not have very long;
therefore, everything he does, everything he says, everything in his life takes
on increased value and meaning and the time becomes more and more precious? 
Time becomes more and more precious every day.  It is a precious day of 24
hours.  </p>

<p>So for someone to hear these things and to dismiss them, to
ignore them and to just go about their life, we know that this means that God
has not opened up their ears and their eyes.  He has not given them spiritual
sight and hearing.  However, it is also unbelief.  They just do not believe
what they are hearing.  </p>

<p>Let us quickly go back to Jonah 3.  After the people
believed God, fasted, and put on sackcloth, we read that the king of Nineveh
got involved.  Then we read the decree of the king in Jonah 3:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
violence that <i>is </i>in their hands.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them turn.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Turn&rdquo; is what &ldquo;repent&rdquo; means.  Turn. 
Turn from the way in which you are going.  What way are you going?  Where are
you headed?  You are headed for destruction.  Turn.  Repent.  Turn to God.  Of
course, of ourselves, we cannot.  </p>

<p>When it comes to saving repentance, like saving faith, God
does the work.  It is God who does the work, but there is also an element of
repentance that we do in response to the command of God.  It is just like
belief, even though belief does not save us.  In this same way, the response of
turning from our sins will not save us either.  </p>

<p>The Ninevites knew this.  After they took these steps, they
said in Jonah 3:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent, and turn away
from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </p>

<p>A good way of looking at this is the analogy that I have
used before of the Gulf oil spill.  If you remember, this oil spill went on
through practically the whole summer.  For quite some time, they could not stop
the gushing of the oil into the water.  The water was getting polluted and the
sea life was dying.  It was ugly and filthy.  It got to the beaches and killed
all kinds of animals.  This was a good analogy of sin because sin is ugly and
filthy and dirty, just like oil.  </p>

<p>This relates to the problem that we have, which is that we
have a source of sin that comes from our hearts.  Then there comes the
outworking of these sins, which we see in our lives.  We see drinking, drugs,
stealing, lying, cheating, killing, adultery, etc.  These are all of the
outworkings of sin in our thoughts and in our actions and in the things that we
say.  </p>

<p>For awhile, they could not stop the source of the oil spill
and they knew this.  What they did, though, was they cleaned up the outer
contamination.  They cleaned up the beaches.  Wherever this oil was spreading,
they were trying to get to it to get it out of the sea and to clean up the land
areas that it was infecting.  Yet all the while, they knew that it was still
coming forth like a geyser and that it was still gushing.  </p>

<p>This is our response of repentance.  We clean up our life
outwardly.  Clean it up.  Yes, throw away the cigarettes.  Stop going to the
bars.  Get away from these things that we have been involved with that are
sinful and evil, but do these things knowing that this is not saving
repentance.  Saving repentance is when the source is turned off, by God&rsquo;s
grace.  </p>

<p>In the secular, physical world, God allowed this oil spill
to happen, but they finally shut it off.  This is the part that God has to do
in our lives.  He has to give us a new heart and a new spirit.  However, there are
two errors that people make.  </p>

<p>In this analogy, they first of all think that cleaning up
the beach is all that they need to do.  &ldquo;This is all that I have to do.  If I
stop these outward sins that are evident to all, to me as well as to others,
this is salvation.&rdquo;  But, no, this is not.  &ldquo;All manner of evil&rdquo; proceeds out
of the heart.  Until the heart is changed, we have not repented in a satisfying
way.  But who can change their heart?  None of us can, and so we need God.  As
it says in Jeremiah 31, &ldquo;Turn thou me, and I shall be turned&hellip;surely after that
I was turned, I repented.&rdquo;  It is after God gives us a new heart that we have
saving repentance.  </p>

<p>So some people make the mistake of thinking that cleaning up
the beach is satisfying repentance to God, when it is not.  Then some people
make a second error.  They realize that there is a gusher, and so they think, &ldquo;I
am not going to do anything.  I am not going to clean up anything.  Why should
I bother?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Can you imagine if they had taken this position in the
Gulf?  What if they had waited until they had been able to seal off the oil
well before they started cleaning up its effects?  If they had done this, the
situation would have grown worse and worse and uglier and uglier.  Plus, there
was no guarantee that they could even do this.  </p>

<p>So this is also an error.  It is an error to think, &ldquo;I
cannot repent.&rdquo;  Even though the truth is that we cannot repent unto salvation,
you and I can crumple up the packet of cigarettes and toss them.  You can and
so can I.  We can pray to God and then try our very best not to lie.  We can
turn from whatever sin there is.  </p>

<p>God &ldquo;commandeth all men every where to repent.&rdquo;  He actually
commands us to &ldquo;repent ye, and believe,&rdquo; even though neither will save us.  Neither
will save us, but now we are getting in line with God&rsquo;s will.  We are going to
God and we are saying to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I believe that this is it.  I know these
things are not going to save me, but may You have mercy upon me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>At this point, we are getting into the position that the
Ninevites were in when they cried to God for mercy.  We can maybe look at this
another time.  There are a couple of other things that we can do, that God
permits us to do, all the while realizing that nothing we do, that no work we
do could ever save us.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
