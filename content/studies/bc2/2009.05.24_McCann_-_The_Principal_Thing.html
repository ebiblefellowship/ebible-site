<p>If everyone could turn to Proverbs 1, I thought that it
would be a good idea for us to take a look at what the Bible has to say a
little bit about wisdom because wisdom is key, it seems, at this time.  It has
actually always been essential, but especially in our day.  In our day, it is
extremely important that we have wisdom.  It says in Proverbs 1:1-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; To
know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; To receive
the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; To give subtlety
to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. A wise <i>man </i>will
hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto
wise counsels: To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
the wise, and their dark sayings. The fear of the LORD <i>is </i>the beginning
of knowledge: <i>but </i>fools despise wisdom and instruction.  </p>

<p>So this is one place where we read about wisdom, and the
Proverbs are full of verses like this.  Also, if you could turn over to
Proverbs 4.  Unfortunately, we do not have the time to read how God describes
wisdom as a valuable treasure that should be sought for, but it says in
Proverbs 4:5-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it </i>not; neither
decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve
thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom <i>is </i>the principal thing; <i>therefore

</i>get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.  </p>

<p>We can see again and again in the Proverbs, as well as in many
parts of the Bible, how God speaks extremely highly of wisdom and demands that
we &ldquo;<b>get wisdom</b>.&rdquo;  It is &ldquo;<b>the principal thing</b>.&rdquo;  And what does &ldquo;principal&rdquo;
mean?  It means that it is chief; it is the best; it is the greatest thing.  </p>

<p>It is not money, because many people think that money is the
principal thing.  It is not possessions, getting what you can get out of this
world.  This is the principal thing with many people.  It is not boyfriends or
girlfriends and just having a lot of friends in general.  This is not the
principal thing.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>The principal thing</b>&rdquo; or the item that should have
top priority is wisdom, but not worldly wisdom.  There is a wisdom of the world
that God has given.  It is almost funny.  God gave man wisdom; and by the
wisdom that God gave man, he tries to prove that there is no God.  </p>

<p>I am sure that this was God&rsquo;s intent to allow this to
happen.  He has given the world wisdom.  He has given some men brilliant minds
in order to develop theories like evolution, which kind of goes contrary to the
idea of having a brilliant mind because evolution is not a brilliant theory; it
is a foolish theory.  It is a theory that has no basis in fact or even no basis
in science.  It cannot be proven in any way; all of the evidence goes contrary
to evolution.  </p>

<p>But God tells us to &ldquo;<b>get wisdom</b>.&rdquo;  Just to let us
know what this primarily means, it means to get Jesus.  It means to get Jesus
because Jesus is wisdom.  We read in 1 Corinthians 1, He &ldquo;<b>is made unto us
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification</b>.&rdquo;  He <span class="underline">is</span> wisdom.  </p>

<p>This is why in Proverbs 8 we read that wisdom is
personified; it takes on a personality.  This is because it has in the Lord
Jesus.  If we were to become saved and Christ would enter into us, we would
find wisdom.  We would be counted wise in God&rsquo;s sight.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, if we do not possess the Spirit of God in
salvation, then the Bible considers us a fool.  We might be intelligent.  We might
be very smart in our schoolwork or in our occupation or profession.  We might
excel.  Amongst our friends, we might be looked upon as being very smart and
intelligent.  But as far as the Bible and God are concerned, we are a fool. 
This is how the Lord breaks up the human race.  There are the wise and then
there are the foolish.  </p>

<p>I was wondering why it is that some believe that May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 will be the day of the rapture.  Some believe this.  They
believe this.  God&rsquo;s people believe this, and yet why do others not believe
that May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be the rapture?  </p>

<p>It is interesting when talking to people&mdash;as we share these
things about the coming day of the Lord beginning on this date&mdash;because, again
and again, someone will say, &ldquo;I will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011. 
What are you going to say then?  What are you going to do on May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>People like to say this, and this could be people in the
church or those outside of the church.  Just Google it; just put in &ldquo;May 21,
2011&rdquo; and you will see all kinds of discussion in Yahoo and Google groups where
this is the topic that, more than likely, a Family Radio listener inserted.  You
will find that all kinds of people respond to this information.  You will find,
again and again, people saying, &ldquo;May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011 is going to come and
you are going to look awfully dumb.  You are going to look foolish.&rdquo;  Others
say, &ldquo;You are giving Christianity a bad name because May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011 will come and then what?  Everybody whom we have told will look upon us
like we have egg all over our faces.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But I really do not think that they are that concerned about
 Christianity, to tell you the truth.  I really do not think that individuals
who bring this up and say, &ldquo;Well, how are you going to look on that day?,&rdquo; are
actually too concerned as to how we are going to look.  I do not think so.  I
think that this is just something that they want to throw out there,
off-the-cuff and quickly; it is something that they will just say.  But the reality
is that people who say this will declare it because they do not trust the
Bible.  </p>

<p>This is what the whole issue comes down to regarding May 21<sup>st</sup>
in 2011 and the five-month period ending on October 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  Do
you trust the Bible or not?  For people who do not trust the Bible, this is not
only unlikely but it is as ridiculous to them as evolution is to the child of
God.  This is because they do not trust the Bible.  They do not think that
something written nearly 2,000 years ago could have any kind of prophecy that
not only gives us the year but gives us the actual month and day of Christ&rsquo;s
return.  They really do not trust the Bible.  </p>

<p>Well, one thing that we could say to someone who would make
this kind of statement to us like, &ldquo;What are you going to do come May 22<sup> nd</sup>, 2011?,&rdquo; is to say, &ldquo;Yes, this is a prophecy and we are telling
people what the Bible says.  We are declaring what the Word of God says when we
say that May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be the rapture.&rdquo;  &ldquo;This,&rdquo; we could say,
&ldquo;is declaring forth the Word.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But it is likewise a prophecy to say, &ldquo;It is not going to
happen.  I will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011.&rdquo;  This is also a
prophecy.  This is as much a prophecy as saying that May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will be the rapture.  This is because they are saying that they know the
future, that they know what is going to happen, that they know how things are
going to work out and that there is no way that God is going to do this and so
it is going to be life as normal.  &ldquo;We will continue on; the world will
continue.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Alright, this is your prophecy.  This is your declaration,
which is based on what?  What is this based on?  </p>

<p>In the world, this is just based on the whole idea that the
Bible is not how you live your life.  You live your life the way that you want
to live it and you do the things that you want to do according to what you,
yourself, say.  </p>

<p>People in the world trust their own minds and their own
feelings and their own ideas.  So, of course, May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2011 is going to come.  They just throw this out there because they do not trust the
Bible at all.  </p>

<p>Yet there are those in the churches and congregations that
will, basically, do the same thing, except they will add a Bible verse.  They
will add a Bible verse like, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  Then they will
make this kind of statement, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour.  May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will not happen, so I will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.  I will see you
then.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, in the book of Jeremiah, repeatedly, again and again,
Jeremiah was given information that God had given to him to share with the
people of Judah concerning the fact that the Lord was going to destroy Jerusalem
and Judah by the hand of the Babylonians, and they insistently denied this. 
They repeatedly denied this through their prophets and leaders, &ldquo;Thou speakest
falsely,&rdquo; it was said to Jeremiah on one occasion.  Again and again, they would
not listen to what Jeremiah the prophet was saying as God moved him to say it. 
</p>

<p>We read in Jeremiah 14:13-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said I, Ah, Lord JEHOVAH! behold, the prophets say unto
them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give
you assured peace in this place. Then JEHOVAH said unto me, The prophets
prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them,
neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination,
and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus saith
JEHOVAH concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not,
yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine
shall those prophets be consumed.  </p>

<p>This day is going to come.  Everybody is in agreement about
this: May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 will come.  On that day, maybe some of us will
not be here because we could die in the space between now and then.  But for
the world, the world will be here.  This day will come and all the individuals
who were saying, &ldquo;Not so, Lord.  See you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>,&rdquo; will perish in
the destruction that they had denied up until this point.  </p>

<p>People want to deny this.  They just want to write this off
and dismiss it.  They can ignore it.  They can avoid it.  They can try to use a
Bible verse or two to say that this is not going to happen.  They can just not
care whatsoever and flippantly make a statement like, &ldquo;I will see you then.&rdquo; 
But no matter how they deny it, this will be proven true because this is coming
forth from the Bible.  On that day, the world will realize, from May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 and on, that God&rsquo;s Word was true, that what He had said was the
truth from the Bible.  </p>

<p>So this is one thing that we could say to people who try to
bring up May 22<sup>nd</sup>.  Really, they are just desperately trying to get
us to think about what to do if this does not happen.  </p>

<p>We have a good example in the Bible of someone who gave a
date to the people of his time, which would be Noah.  We know that Noah did
this because in 2 Peter 2:5, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth <i>person,
</i>a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
ungodly;  </p>

<p>Noah was a &ldquo;<b>preacher of righteousness</b>,&rdquo; who is Christ. 
And from the time that God came to him when he was 480 years old and said, &ldquo;I
am going to destroy the world.  I want you to build an ark and you have 120
years to do it,&rdquo; Noah began to condemn the world of his day through his
actions, through believing God and trusting God.  </p>

<p>Noah just kept working.  From time to time, more than
likely, it was not that big of a deal to people at first because the project
was just getting underway.  They could not really see the actual boat that he
was building.  When judgment is at a distance, people do not think about it; they
relax. </p>

<p>So it started out from 120 years, then it went down to 100
years, then 75 years; time kept elapsing and moving on.  But as it got closer and
the boat was becoming more and more finished and the ark was being completed,
as time was getting shorter and they got to 20 or 15 or 10 years away, I am
sure that the people of Noah&rsquo;s day were beginning to take more notice.  </p>

<p>Since Noah was a &ldquo;<b>preacher of righteousness</b>&rdquo; and he
preached to a world that spoke only one language, everybody could understand
him.  He preached to a world that was on one continent because the world had
not yet been divided as it was in the days of Peleg and man naturally tends to
flock together.  </p>

<p>So this would have been the situation as he was sharing this
information with the people.  And while he was hammering away on the ark, maybe
little neighbor children came up to him and asked, &ldquo;Mr. Noah, why are you
building this ark?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>He would most likely have responded, &ldquo;Well, son, the Lord
has told me that in the year 4990 B.C., He is going to destroy the world with a
flood.  Everything with the breath of life will perish.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then maybe this little boy goes running back home and says, &ldquo;Daddy,
Mommy, do you know what Mr. Noah told me?  He told me that God is going to
destroy the world with a flood!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Daddy and Mommy would have most likely said, &ldquo;Do not worry
about it.  He is a crazy old man.  He has been up to this for a long time.  Do
not listen to anything he says, and I do not want you going back over there to
play anymore either.&rdquo;  Would this not be the case?  &ldquo;I do not want you over
there near that man&rsquo;s house anymore.  You are going to get the wrong kind of
mindset.  You are going to start thinking about these things.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Afterwards, maybe, now and then, they went over to Noah and
said, &ldquo;How dare you talk to my children and tell them this nonsense!  How dare
you!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Noah would have just sadly shaken his head and continued
working.  Time would have kept going by: five years, three years, two years,
the last year, up until the point where God came to him and got more specific, &ldquo;<b>Yet
seven days</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Noah knew the year, the month, and the day.  (What a
coincidence!  So do we: 2011, the fifth month, the twenty-first day.)  Noah
knew precisely when it would be and there would have been some seemingly
well-meaning people who liked Noah, because he was probably a good guy, who would
have gone up to Noah and said, &ldquo;Noah, you have been a good neighbor, except for
this crazy business with the ark.  You are a nice man and we respect you, to
some degree.  Now, Noah, when this does not happen and we get to the eighteenth
day of the second month, Noah, you know what?  Do you realize how foolish you
are going to look?  Do you realize how stupid you are going to look?  Noah, do
not do this to yourself!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So what was Noah going to do?  Was Noah going to stop and
think, &ldquo;Yes, if we get to the eighteenth day, I am going to look really foolish&rdquo;? 
Do you think that Noah had any thoughts like this at all?  </p>

<p>Well, being a person, maybe thoughts like this might have
begun to come to him.  But what would Noah say to himself and say to those
people?  </p>

<p>He would most likely say, &ldquo;I know how this sounds.  Believe me;
I would not have come up with this myself, but God came to me.  I heard
directly from God and He said, &lsquo;<b>In the second month, the seventeenth day of
the month</b>&rsquo; that He was going to make this happen, and I believe God.  I
trust God, so I cannot say anything else.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>And they would say, &ldquo;Well, Noah, how about when this does
not happen, you sign over this ark to me?  And while you are at it, give me the
house.  Since you think that this is going to happen, what do you need these
things for?  Sign them over to me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Would Noah waste a precious minute trying to answer someone
about the eighteenth day of the second month?  Would he?  Absolutely not!  He
would not do this because he knew this for certain.  He knew this for certain
because he had heard this from God and he trusted God and he believed God.  </p>

<p>So people recognize that God came to Noah and warned Noah,
but their response to us is, &ldquo;You people today who believe that May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 is the rapture, are you hearing this from God?  Has God come to
you in a dream?  Has God spoken to you like He spoke to Noah?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We have to admit, &ldquo;No; it is not exactly the same.&rdquo;  This is
because God has given us His Word, the Bible, and we are not to add or subtract
from it, so God will not tell us anything by divine revelation in the way that
He spoke to prophets of old.  He will not give us a dream or a tongue or a
vision or anything like this.  </p>

<p>But is not the Bible the Word of God?  Is not the Scripture
the Word of God?  When we read in the Bible information, is that not coming
from God&rsquo;s mouth, just as surely as when Noah heard from the mouth of God?  </p>

<p>Well, the Bible tells us that this is the same.  Let us go
to Psalm 19:7, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The law of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>perfect, converting the soul&hellip;  </p>

<p>All of these references to &ldquo;<b>the law</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>the
testimony</b>,&rdquo; and so forth, are synonyms for the Word of God, the Bible, just
like Psalm 119.  Psalm 19:7-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">The law of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of JEHOVAH
<i>are </i>right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>pure,
enlightening the eyes. The fear of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>clean, enduring for ever:
the judgments of JEHOVAH <i>are </i>true <i>and </i>righteous altogether. More
to be desired <i>are they </i>than gold&hellip; </p>

<p>Just like wisdom.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the
honeycomb. Moreover by <span class="underline">them</span>&hellip; </p>

<p>That is, the Bible.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;is thy servant warned: <i>and </i>in keeping of them <i>there
is </i>great reward.  </p>

<p>God warns through the Bible.  He warned Noah in Hebrews 11:7: 
</p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he
condemned the world&hellip; </p>

<p>God gave Noah information.  He spoke to him and Noah acted
upon it and &ldquo;<b>moved with fear</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God is giving us information today from the same source.  It
is coming from the exact same source, from His Word.  You are being warned and
so am I.  Before we get to the end, every person in the world today will be
warned of what is to come.  </p>

<p>It is not seen as yet.  We cannot see it and people take
advantage of this to present their declarations and their prophesying that this
is not going to happen, &ldquo;This is not here so why do you worry?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the nature of man.  He does not concern himself with
things that he cannot see.  But God is telling us in the Bible that this is
going to happen.  </p>

<p>Some people are going to understand and they are going to
respond like the Ninevites.  This message will have an impact upon their
lives.  They will be moved like Noah to cry out to God and to turn from the
sins that they can turn from, in order to hope that God might have mercy on
them and save them.  </p>

<p>I went to the verses in Proverbs about wisdom, because this
is what it boils down to.  And in Ecclesiastes 8:1, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who <i>is </i>as the wise <i>man?</i>&hellip; </p>

<p>Or &ldquo;Who is like the wise man?&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and who knoweth the interpretation of a <span class="underline">thing</span>?&hellip; </p>

<p>This is the Hebrew word <i>dabar</i>, which is translated as
&ldquo;word,&rdquo; &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;matter.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;who knoweth the interpretation of a [word]?  </p>

<p>Which means that this is dealing with the Scriptures, and it
is the &ldquo;<b>wise man</b>&rdquo; who is mentioned in verse 5, Ecclesiastes 8:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.  </p>

<p>God has given wisdom to His people in order to discern these
two things: time and judgment.  When Jonah went to Nineveh, he cried out, &ldquo;<b>Yet
forty days, and </b><b>Nineveh</b><b> shall be overthrown</b>.&rdquo;  His warning
contained two elements: time (40 days) and judgment (coming at the end of that
forty-day period, if the Lord had not spared them).  Likewise, God is saying
that &ldquo;<b>a wise man&rsquo;s heart</b>&rdquo; is able to discern or understand these two
things.  </p>

<p>If you turn over to Ecclesiastes 10:2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">A wise man&rsquo;s heart <i>is </i>at his right hand; but a fool&rsquo;s
heart at his left.  </p>

<p>Why does God say this?  He says this because of what we read
in the parable of the sheep and the goats.  Remember, the Lord puts the sheep
at His right and the goats at His left.  This is what He is doing with this
language of &ldquo;wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;foolish.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;<b>wise</b>&rdquo; are His children and they
are &ldquo;<b>at his right hand</b>&rdquo;; they are like the &ldquo;<b>sheep</b>.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;<b>goats</b>&rdquo;

are the &ldquo;<b>foolish</b>,&rdquo; the unsaved of the world, and they are &ldquo;<b>at his
left</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is where &ldquo;<b>a wise man&rsquo;s heart</b>&rdquo; is and the Lord,
at the proper time, will open up the understanding of this individual whom He
has saved to see these things, like the prophet Elisha said to his apprentice, &ldquo;<b>Lord,
I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see</b>,&rdquo; and the Lord opened his eyes
and &ldquo;<b>the mountain <i>was </i>full of horses and chariots of fire</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You see, if God would only open up our eyes to comprehend
the time that we are living in, it would have a tremendous impact on our
lives.  For the next just under two years, we would live in a very different way
than we have been living.  And God does plan to reveal these things to the &ldquo;<b>wise</b>&rdquo;
who are His people.  </p>

<p>If we look at Luke 21, which is the chapter dealing with the
Great Tribulation, parallel to Matthew 24, it says in Luke 21:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.  </p>

<p>He is going to give us a mouth to declare this, which
relates to sharing tracts or however the message is declared.  He will give us &ldquo;<b>a
mouth and wisdom</b>&rdquo; because &ldquo;<b>a wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and
judgment</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we go back to Daniel 12 (some of us are familiar with
this), God speaks of &ldquo;<b>the book</b>,&rdquo; the Bible, in verse 4, Daniel 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even
</i>to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.  </p>

<p>There will be increased understanding and increased wisdom
of the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Look down in verse 9, Daniel 12:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are </i>closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white,
and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand&hellip;  </p>

<p>Wow!  None of the wicked!  The flood came upon &ldquo;<b>the world
of the ungodly</b>.&rdquo;  They were caught &ldquo;<b>as a thief</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Anyone who insists, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour; Christ is
coming as a thief and I do not want to hear any of this,&rdquo; is sealing their own
fate.  Their only hope of deliverance is to recognize these things so that they
can go to God, in the great danger that they are in, and cry to Him.  </p>

<p>Yet God tells us that if anyone is wicked, they are not
going to understand, because this has to be spiritually discerned and natural
men have carnal minds.  They do not have a spiritual mind.  They cannot see
it.  They just cannot see it.  </p>

<p>With the declaration to Noah, &ldquo;<b>For yet seven days</b>&rdquo;
and 2 Peter 3 that relates this to &ldquo;<b>a thousand years</b>,&rdquo; this is the
timeline of history from the Bible.  It is all from the Bible.  Yet they
respond, &ldquo;I do not get it.  Actually, I do not want to get it.  I do not want
to get it.  Let me go on with my life.  Let me continue on.&rdquo;  But it is only
out of love and concern that we would want to share this with them and to share
this with others, to share with the young as well as with the old that this is
going to happen.  </p>

<p>So what makes us special?  Why do we know this?  Look here
in Daniel 12:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;none of the wicked shall understand; but <span class="underline">the wise shall
understand</span>.  </p>

<p>It is as simple as that.  &ldquo;<b>My sheep hear my voice</b>.&rdquo;  The
goats do not.  It is simple as that.  It comes down to this.  </p>

<p>The true believer, the child of God, is given insight
because Christ is able to do this.  He is able to open our understanding so
that we can comprehend teachings from the Bible.  But unfortunately and tragically
for someone who is not one of His elect, they will not understand.  </p>

<p>There is another good verse about this in Nehemiah 8.  Do
you remember Ezra?  We read in Nehemiah 8:5-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Book is unsealed; it is open.  This is relating to our
time, to our day.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and when he opened it, all the people stood up: And Ezra
blessed JEHOVAH, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with
lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped JEHOVAH with
<i>their </i>faces to the ground. Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin,
Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah,
and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people <i>stood
</i>in their place.</p>

<p>How many names were mentioned?  Thirteen names were
mentioned because this is relating to our time, as we are 13,000 years from the
creation of the world and it is at this time when God opens up the Book and He
gives the sense and reveals to His people a right understanding.  </p>

<p>And look at verse 8, Nehemiah 8:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave
the sense, and caused <i>them </i>to understand the reading.  </p>

<p>This is all in God&rsquo;s hands.  This is all in the Lord&rsquo;s
hands.  He has to have &ldquo;<b>mercy on whom he will <i>have mercy</i></b>,&rdquo; but we
do not know who that is and so we pray.  </p>

<p>Fathers and mothers really should be praying for their
children, &ldquo;O Lord, open up their eyes that they might see these things,&rdquo;
because parents can see the way that their children are going and their
interests.  It becomes pretty obvious if they are thinking about college when
that is several years off.  They are thinking about a future occupation, which
is never going to happen.  They are thinking about things past this date.  </p>

<p>It would be good for any parent to nicely say, &ldquo;Now, hold it
a second.  Have you forgotten?  May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 is the end.  It is
not going to come.  It is not going to come.&rdquo;  And we could say to them, &ldquo;I
love you.  I love you very much and I would really desire for you to have a
life in this world, a family and children.  I would like to be a grandparent. 
I would like to see these things.  I would like to see you progress in a field
of occupation, and all of this, but I have to tell you the truth because I do
love you.  This is not going to happen.  It is not going to happen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God has told us what will happen.  To many people, this is a
terrible tragedy.  But we do not know if the Lord might save one of the people whom
we love, and so we can pray that God would open their eyes and that they might
begin to see.  </p>

<p>You know, it is a great blessing when a little child comes
to you and says in tears, &ldquo;I am really worried about May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  I am afraid.&rdquo;  This is a wonderful blessing for a parent, and it would
be great if all parents could experience this.</p>

<p>Well, let us go to Matthew 25.  We will finish with this. 
It says in Matthew 25:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.  </p>

<p>Who is the bridegroom?  He is Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ. 
The Bible is clear about this.  </p>

<p>Matthew 25:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And five of them were wise, and five <i>were </i>foolish.  </p>

<p>This is just as God looks at mankind.  He sees the wise and
the foolish.  </p>

<p>Matthew 25:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">They that <i>were </i>foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>

<p>What does the &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; represent in the Bible?  It represents
the Word of God.  &ldquo;<b>Thy word <i>is </i>a lamp unto my feet</b>,&rdquo; it says in
Psalm 119.  Also in Proverbs, God connects the lamp to the Bible.  </p>

<p>In the world today, do people who are saved have Bibles as
well as people who are not saved?  The wise and the foolish both have Bibles. 
In many churches today where God&rsquo;s Spirit is not, they have a Bible in the
pulpit.  They have the &ldquo;lamp.&rdquo;  In Christianity, everyone has the lamp.  Maybe
not personally, but their pastor or their elder has the lamp; they have the
Bible.  </p>

<p>It goes on in Matthew 25:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.  </p>

<p>We will not get into this, but this is pointing to the
church age and how God had sealed up His Word so that it could not be known. 
Many of the details and teachings of the Bible could not be known.  </p>

<p>Then in verse 6, Matthew 25:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Midnight&rdquo; is a reference to the Great Tribulation.  It is
during this time that we are receiving the cry that He comes, &ldquo;<b>Thy kingdom
come</b>&rdquo;; &ldquo;Come quickly, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;  Well, the prayer has been answered. 
The Bridegroom is coming.  He is coming.  </p>

<p>Then verse 7, Matthew 25:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the
foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.  </p>

<p>The oil represents the Holy Spirit.  If someone has a lamp,
they have the Bible.  In their vessels if they possess oil, they can light
their lamp.  That is, they can see: &ldquo;<b>The wise man&rsquo;s eyes <i>are </i>in his
head; but the fool walketh in darkness</b>.&rdquo;  They can understand what the
Bible says because it is being illuminated by the Spirit of God, typified by
the oil.  </p>

<p>However, if an individual has the Bible, the lamp, and he
does not have any oil, he does not have the Holy Spirit in him.  He could then read
the exact same verses that the believer is reading and it will be dark.  He
cannot light the lamp.  </p>

<p>God did not write the Bible to make it easy to be understood
but to make it very complex and difficult to be understood.  No man, of his
own, can understand the Bible unless God gives him of His Spirit and opens up
his eyes to truth.  </p>

<p>Then it says in verse 9, Matthew 25:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so; </i>lest there be not
enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came&hellip;  </p>

<p>One other thing that we see here in Matthew 25:6 is:  </p>

<p class="verse">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
cometh&hellip;  </p>

<p>Yet He did not come right then.  He did not come
immediately, which you would think would be different if it will be as the
church says it will be and that He could come at any time.  If the cry is made,
then He should be there right then, but there was a period of time from the
announcement of His coming.  In order for these virgins to have their
discussion and for the foolish virgins to go to seek out oil for their lamps, there
was a space.  </p>

<p>But that is not the purpose of this parable.  This parable is
letting us know that this fits with God warning Noah before the flood, with God
warning Lot before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, with God warning the
Ninevites before their (possible) destruction, with God warning Israel before
their destruction in 709 B.C., and with God warning Judah before their
destruction in 587 B.C.  It fits with everything that the Bible tells us. 
There will be a warning in advance, a forewarning, in order for individuals to
be moved with fear, those whom God is dealing with, so that they can cry out to
God.  If God is pleased to do so, He can save them.  </p>

<p>But they go to buy oil, and the wise say here in Matthew
25:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.   </p>

<p>Why did they not just give them of their oil?  </p>

<p>Can you or I share the Holy Spirit or salvation with another
person?  We cannot do that.  That is impossible.  But we can tell them to go to
the One who can give it, which is God Himself, the Triune God.  Go &ldquo;<b>to them</b>&rdquo;

who buy and sell, as God likens Himself to a merchant in Isaiah 55.  </p>

<p>So while they are going, they did not go to the right
place.  They did not go to God.  They went to others who they thought had the
truth.  </p>

<p>Continuing in Matthew 25:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him
to the marriage: and the door was shut.  </p>

<p>This will be on May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  </p>

<p>So it comes down to wisdom, which is &ldquo;<b>the principal thing</b>.&rdquo; 
And God tells us, &ldquo;<b>If any of you lack wisdom</b>,&rdquo; and the majority of the
world lacks wisdom, &ldquo;<b>let him ask of God</b>.&rdquo;  That is, we can go to Him and
we can go to Him exactly where we are.  We are hearing these things, but maybe
we do not see it.  So we pray, &ldquo;O Lord, give me wisdom so that I might see and
so that I might understand.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Bible also tells us that the Scriptures are &ldquo;<b>able to
make thee wise unto salvation</b>&rdquo; in 2 Timothy 3:15.  If we have this wisdom, Christ
indwells us and then we will begin to understand.  We will begin to see exactly
where we are in history.  </p>

<p>It is as if the world has built their cities and their
houses on a train track and there is a locomotive or a super-powered train that
is coming down the tracks.  It is going to destroy them, yet there are a few
people who can see the rails vibrating and they can hear the sound of the
whistle and so they are trying to tell other people, &ldquo;Get off the track!  Get
out of the way!  It is going to come and destroy you and destroy everything
that you possess!&rdquo;  But in blindness, in deafness, they do not hear and they do
not see and they continue going on as though it is going to be this way forever,
yet it is not.  It is not.  The day is fast coming.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
