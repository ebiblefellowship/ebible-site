<p>Today is Father&rsquo;s Day.  I normally do not mention holidays
that fall on Sunday, like Mother&rsquo;s Day or Father&rsquo;s Day.  I think that there are
enough things that are competing out in the world that take away the attention
off of the Sunday Sabbath, so we do not really need to focus on these things. 
Just think of all of the sporting events that are on Sundays.  Football games
are primarily on Sunday, as well as baseball.  </p>

<p>Every sport has all kinds of things that people get involved
with, but there is no way that people can be going to stadiums and spending
their time rooting and cheering and then also spending time with God on the
Sabbath.  I am sure that some people try to do this, but they do not mix too
well.  Actually, they do not mix at all.  They are like water and oil, and so
this is not a good thing to do.  </p>

<p>Today, however, I would like to talk to you about a father
who understands that there is a day of judgment.  He understands that May 21 of
2011 is Judgment Day and he warns his children about this.  He also warns
everyone else.  </p>

<p>Who do you think that I am talking about?  Actually, not
only did he warn his children and not only did he warn everyone else, he was
also correct in his understanding of Judgment Day and the end of the world.  He
was correct.  This date was proven.  We still have to wait for May 21, 2011, and then it will be proven.  The only reason that it is not proven yet is
because it has not arrived as yet.  </p>

<p>But this man was a father and he heard directly from God
concerning a date.  He knew the year, the month, and the day of the coming
judgment.  Because of this, he began telling people.  He also, of course, spent
a lot of time with his own children.  We can be sure of this.  </p>

<p>What does God tell us in Ephesians about fathers?  Go to
Ephesians 6.  By the way, these are the primary instructions for children.  We
read elsewhere in the book of Ephesians, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Wives,
submit yourselves unto your own husbands.&rdquo;  For the children, this is what God
has given for you to listen to and to do.  If you are wondering whether or not
you are a child of God, a big way of looking at yourself and examining yourself
is to see how you are doing as a child in relation to what God says in
Ephesians 6:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour
thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; That it may
be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  </p>

<p>Do not let this last statement fool you because it is not
talking about this earth.  If a child honors and obeys his parents, this may
not necessarily extend his life a single day.  Of course, it could keep you out
of a lot of trouble and God could work through this to keep someone alive, but
this would not be the cause of someone living to be one hundred or anything
like this.  God is referring to the &ldquo;new earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Children are to honor their parents and this would be a sign
of a true believer, someone who is a child of God.  Therefore, you will &ldquo;live
long on the earth&rdquo; because you will have everlasting life, which is a long
time.  You will live long on the new earth if God has given you a new heart and
a new spirit and if you are genuinely and sincerely honoring your parents and
obeying them as a result of this.  </p>

<p>Now look at Ephesians 6:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  </p>

<p>This is what true believers desire to do.  True believing
fathers desire to bring their children up &ldquo;in the nurture&hellip;of the Lord,&rdquo; which
means to bring them the Gospel, to read the Bible to them, to share what the
Bible has to say with them, to pray for them, to nurture them in the Word of
God by having Family Radio on.  For your whole child&rsquo;s life, this is a good way
to desire to nurture them.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are many families who do not have
Family Radio on and they do not listen to Bible reading or to beautiful hymns or
teaching that is true to the Bible.  They might have the local rock station
on.  If they are more intellectual, maybe they have a symphony orchestra on;
but this is not going to help anyone.  To have Family Radio on can be a big
help for parents in raising their children &ldquo;in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you know what would be an excellent thing for parents to
do?  It would be for parents to make sure that their children sit down with
them and listen to the &ldquo;Open Forum&rdquo; program from Monday through Friday.  From
Monday through Friday, for at least an hour out of the hour and a half, sit
them down to listen with you.  Parents are supposed to be the ones who are in
control in the household, and so you can tell your children, &ldquo;I desire for you
to listen to the &lsquo;Open Forum&rsquo; for at least an hour because I love you and
because this will bless you and help you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They have heard this from us, as mothers and fathers, but in
a house where everyone is living together, everyone else knows everyone else&rsquo;s
faults and failing.  It is easy for either the wife and the husband, the
husband and the wife, or the children towards their parents to bring these
things to mind and to say something like, &ldquo;Dad is telling me to do this, and
yet he gets angry.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So, effectively, they can decide to not listen to the
parents because these parents have sinned in the house, certainly, from
time-to-time.  Therefore, they believe that they can just write off what Mom or
 Dad is telling them about Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>However, to have children seated and listening to the &ldquo;Open
Forum&rdquo; where Mr. Camping is teaching, and has been for fifty years and has also
given nothing but a good testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ, is something that
can be very important and effective to the children who are listening.  If you
remember, God says, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country,
and in his own house.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Mom and Dad can maybe have some difficulty with their own
family, but Mr. Camping is certainly someone who teaches very soundly and
clearly; and every night they are going to hear that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  They are going to hear this every night.  </p>

<p>I think that if you try to start this with your children,
you might find that they do not want to listen; at least some of them, but some
will, however, by God&rsquo;s grace.  He is working in the lives of some children,
but some children do not want to listen.  They cannot sit still or maybe they
talk with one another.  You might have to say, &ldquo;Look, I want you to listen.  I
am going to stay here with you.  I am going to listen.  Let us listen to this
for the next hour, because this is so important.  The time is so short and I
know that you can be blessed by listening to Mr. Camping on the &lsquo;Open Forum.&rsquo;&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>This would be a very good way for parents to begin to follow
what God is saying here in bringing their children up &ldquo;in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord.&rdquo;  This could be a way that God might bless.  </p>

<p>I was talking about a father.  Do you know who this father
is who warned his children of the day of judgment?  It is Noah.  </p>

<p>Do you know what God says about Noah?  Look at Hebrews 11. 
Sometimes we get caught up with the whole idea of explaining how it is that
believers can know, when the Bible says &ldquo;of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>.&rdquo; 
We can look at Noah to show how God did reveal specifically to Noah the timing
of the end of the world, but we might miss something that God says here in
Hebrews 11, which is the faith chapter.  We read in Hebrews 11:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.  </p>

<p>All through this chapter, we see this particular Greek word
translated as &ldquo;faith.&rdquo;  We see the word faith, faith, faith, as we read of
these people of God who did this or that tremendous thing &ldquo;by faith&rdquo; and
accomplished this or that &ldquo;by faith.&rdquo;  We read of this all throughout this
chapter.  </p>

<p>If we make a substitution with the word &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; this will
help us a lot in our understanding of this.  What substitution should we make? 
Instead of saying &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; we can substitute &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo;  This is because God is
love, God is wisdom, He is sanctification and righteousness, and He is faith. 
His Name is &ldquo;Faithful and True.&rdquo;  Jesus said, &ldquo;I am <span class="underline">the</span> way, <span class="underline">the</span>

truth, and <span class="underline">the</span> life.&rdquo;  He is The Faith and God has given Him this Name. 
</p>

<p>In the book of Jude, it speaks of &ldquo;the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints.&rdquo;  This would be referring to Christ who was
delivered for the sins of His people &ldquo;from the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So when we read in Hebrews 11:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for&hellip;  </p>

<p>We could say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now [<i>Chris</i><i>t</i>] is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen.  </p>

<p>Now go down to verse 6, Hebrews 11:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">But without faith <i>it is </i>impossible to please <i>him: </i>for
he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that </i>he is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek him.  </p>

<p>Without Christ, it is impossible to please God.  No one can
please Him without Christ.  He is the One who is the doorway to Heaven.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 7, Hebrews 11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or:  </p>

<p class="verse">By [<i>Chris</i><i>t</i>] Noah, being warned of God of things
not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
is by faith [<i>Chris</i><i>t</i>].  </p>

<p>So Noah, &ldquo;by faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;by Christ,&rdquo; did these things.  He
did them &ldquo;by Christ.&rdquo;  If we quickly scan over:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;being warned of God of things not seen as yet&hellip;  </p>

<p>We could say:  </p>

<p class="verse">By [<i>Chris</i><i>t</i>] Noah&hellip;moved with fear&hellip;  </p>

<p>Noah &ldquo;moved with fear&rdquo; by the working of the Lord Jesus Christ
within him.  This is why Noah believed God.  When God told Noah about the
flood, he believed &ldquo;by Christ&rdquo; because Christ worked in him.  </p>

<p>Remember what we read in Philippians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his
</i>good pleasure.  </p>

<p>Noah was not a super man.  He was a man like anyone else.  He
was a sinner, even though we do not read about his sin until later.  In Genesis
9, we read about when he became a husbandman and drank of the fruit and got
drunk.  But he was just a man.  He was just a man; however, God came to him and
gave him information.  He believed this and acted upon this &ldquo;by faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;by Christ.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Look at Genesis 6 where God speaks of man&rsquo;s sinfulness.  We
read in Genesis 6:5-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And God saw that the wickedness of man <i>was </i>great in the
earth, and <i>that </i>every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i>was </i>only
evil continually. And it repented JEHOVAH that he had made man on the earth,
and it grieved him at his heart. And JEHOVAH said, I will destroy man whom I
have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. But
Noah found grace in the eyes of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This is the identical way of salvation today, &ldquo;For by grace
are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves.&rdquo;  It is not your faith
that saves.  It is not any man&rsquo;s faith.  Remember that God tells us in
Galatians 2:16 that we are &ldquo;not justified by the works of the law.&rdquo;  To
exercise faith is a work.  Then Galatians 2:16 goes on to say that we are
justified &ldquo;by the faith of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;  It is by His faith that anyone
becomes saved.  </p>

<p>Noah was identical to any modern person of our day because
Noah was a sinner.  Since God uses the word &ldquo;grace&rdquo; to describe Noah in that he
&ldquo;found grace,&rdquo; this indicates that he was as big a sinner as anyone else.  No
one needs grace unless they are a sinner, unless they have transgressed the Law
of God and need a Saviour.  It is then that they need grace.  </p>

<p>For Noah to have found grace in God&rsquo;s sight is letting us
know that he had the same heart of unbelief and was as desperately wicked as
all of the others whom we just read about whose hearts were &ldquo;only evil
continually.&rdquo;  But God changed his heart and gave him a new heart.  This is
where it begins with Noah, as God has given him a new heart and spirit.  Now
Noah can begin to act.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 9, Genesis 6:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">These <i>are </i>the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man <i>and
</i>perfect in his generations, <i>and </i>Noah walked with God.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;just&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; in Genesis
7:1, and so Noah was a righteous man.  </p>

<p>People read these kinds of descriptions of individuals in
the Bible and they think that they were good, that they were morally good. 
Then they tend to think that if they could only be as good as them, then they,
too, would find grace or that they could also be accepted by God; and yet all
of this comes after salvation.  </p>

<p>So Noah was a righteous man, a just man, because of the
righteousness of Christ.  He was perfect because God had made him perfect, and
he walked with God.  </p>

<p>Who else walked with God and was not because God took him? 
Enoch walked with God, and Enoch is also mentioned in Hebrews 11 as a man of
faith; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ saved Enoch.  After Enoch was 365 years
old, he was translated.  God gave us Enoch&rsquo;s age in order to let us know that
after &ldquo;the acceptable year of the LORD&rdquo; would be the rapture.  God also uses
this picture in other ways.  </p>

<p>So Noah found grace.  He was a righteous man.  He was
perfect.  He walked with God, which means that he was keeping His
commandments.  God tells us to &ldquo;walk in his statutes.&rdquo;  God also tells us to &ldquo;run
the way of thy commandments.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When we can walk with God, when we can walk the way of His
commandments, then we are no longer lame, spiritually speaking.  If we cannot
walk in His commandments, it is like we are a lame man, which is why God uses
this figure sometimes.  He also does this to paint a picture of salvation; for
example, when a lame man begins to walk or to jump or to run around.  </p>

<p>But here in Genesis 6, God gave Noah specific instructions
concerning the ark.  We read in Genesis 6:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 6:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein <i>is </i>the breath of life, from under
heaven; <i>and </i>every thing that <i>is </i>in the earth shall die. But with
thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and
thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons&rsquo; wives with thee.  </p>

<p>God told Noah this long before the flood came.  He told him
this long before.  He is just getting the commandments to build the ark.  He
just got the specifications from God, and God has already told him, &ldquo;You, your
wife, and your three sons and their wives are going to enter into the ark.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In other words, this is a good illustration of election, as
God has predestinated people before the foundation of the world to salvation. 
It was only these eight people who did go into the ark many years later.  After
God was ready to bring the flood, no one else went into the ark.  It was only
the ones whom God had preordained, those who He told Noah would enter into the
ark.  These were the only and exact ones who were delivered from the flood;
nobody else was.  </p>

<p>Noah was told that he himself, his wife, and his sons and
their wives would be the ones going into the ark, but he was not told that no
one else would.  So in his mind, it was not necessarily just them.  Perhaps he
hoped that others could also hear and be warned and enter into the ark, but God
here is prefiguring the doctrine of election by telling Noah before the boat
was even built who was to enter into the ark.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 6:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
he.  </p>

<p>God told Noah what to do and Noah did it.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Hebrews 11.  We read again in Hebrews
11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being <span class="underline">warned</span> of God of things not seen as
yet&hellip;  </p>

<p>In relation to being &ldquo;warned of God,&rdquo; this word &ldquo;warned&rdquo; is
also found in Luke 2:26 where it is referring to a man named Simeon.  We read
in Luke 2:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name <i>was </i>Simeon;
and the same man <i>was </i>just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel:
and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was <span class="underline">revealed</span> unto him by the
Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ. 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; is the same Greek word that was
translated as &ldquo;warned&rdquo; in Hebrews 11:7.  God came to this man named Simeon in
some supernatural way and gave him information concerning the Messiah,
concerning Christ, and that Simeon himself would not die &ldquo;before he had seen
the Lord&rsquo;s Christ.&rdquo;  We know this story.  Simeon does see the baby Jesus and he
takes Him in his arms.  Then Simeon proclaims, &ldquo;For mine eyes have seen thy
salvation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The reason that I wanted to go to this verse was to show
another English word to help us understand this word that was translated &ldquo;warned.&rdquo; 
We find the word &ldquo;revealed,&rdquo; as when God reveals something; and so God could
reveal something in such a way that He is warning us as He is giving us this
information.  </p>

<p>This word is also found in Hebrews 12:25.  This same word
that was translated as &ldquo;warned&rdquo; is also translated as another English word.  </p>

<p class="verse">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
not who refused him that <span class="underline">spake</span> on earth, much more <i>shall not </i>we <i>escape,

</i>if we turn away from him that <i>speaketh </i>from heaven:  </p>

<p>In the middle of this verse, the English word &ldquo;spake&rdquo; is the
word that was also translated as &ldquo;warned.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is saying here in Hebrews 12:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
not who refused him that [<i>warneth</i>] on earth, much more <i>shall not </i>we

<i>escape</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>I wanted to read this because God is likening and
identifying the word &ldquo;warned&rdquo; with His speaking, with His Word, with the Word
that comes out of His mouth.  This word has to do with warning.  </p>

<p>God has told us in Psalm 19 something that is important for
us to know because as we tell people that Judgment Day will come next year, we
use the example of Noah and how God came to him and foretold him, &ldquo;For yet
seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth.&rdquo;  They will say that
they understand this, but then they say that we need to understand that God
spoke directly to Noah.  They understand that God gave divine revelation to Noah. 
Then they say, &ldquo;If God did this to me, if God spoke this way to me, I would act
just like Noah.  I would be as obedient as he was and I would get busy, too,
doing whatever it was that God wanted me to do.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you think that this statement that these people make is
true or false?  Is it true that this would be their reaction if God spoke to
them like He did to Noah?  Let us put it this way.  A person today who is
completely disregarding God&rsquo;s warning right at this point and at this moment in
time of Judgment Day being next year on May 21, 2011, if God spoke to this
individual like He did to Noah, would this cause that person to say, &ldquo;Oh boy! 
Now I believe!  Now I understand!  I have to get busy now and warn everyone&rdquo;? 
This is the question, and the answer is no!  </p>

<p>They might actually try to get involved in some things, but
they would not last; they would not be able to endure.  They would probably
still end up finally disregarding this, because it is not the way that God is
warning people that is the problem.  It is not that He is not speaking from
Heaven with thunderbolts and lightning or that He is not showing Himself to any
specific individual that Judgment Day will be next year.  </p>

<p>God was able to warn the Ninevites without all of these
kinds of theatrics.  He just sent a lone prophet, Jonah, to say, &ldquo;Yet forty
days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  There were no miracles.  Yes, Jonah
had come out of the belly of a whale, but we do not know what the Ninevites
knew about this.  They probably did not know much about this, and yet God used
just the simple words of a lone prophet to warn a whole city; and they
believed.  </p>

<p>They believed, but many people think that they would believe
as recommended by the rich man in torments in Luke 16 who said of his brethren,
&ldquo;But if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.&rdquo;  This is what he
said to father Abraham, but father Abraham said, &ldquo;If they hear not Moses and
the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Moses
and the prophets&rdquo; is a reference to the Bible, to the Word of God.  </p>

<p>So God is saying that they would not believe even if God
parted the Red Sea, that they would not believe even if God struck a rock and
poured out water like a river, that they would not believe even if they saw
manna falling every day in a desolate wilderness for a period of forty years. 
They would not believe because it is not the signs or the outward evidence that
can change anybody.  </p>

<p>If you are unsaved, you have a heart of stone, which is going
to stay this way.  It might harden more still, but it is not going to get any
softer unless God changes your heart and gives you a new heart and a new
spirit.  </p>

<p>So for someone to say this, it is almost as if they are
saying that it is unfair that God spoke directly to Noah but wants them to read
a Book, which is kind of like Naaman the Syrian who was upset at the manner in
which God had brought cleansing to his leprosy.  Elisha had simply sent a
messenger out to Naaman and told him, &ldquo;Go and wash in Jordan seven times.&rdquo;  But
Naaman the Syrian became furious with Elisha, that great prophet, because he had
not come out and addressed him himself.  </p>

<p>Naaman had expected Elisha himself to come out and say a few
words and do something dramatic; however, he instead sent a lowly messenger.  If
it had not been for Naaman&rsquo;s servants who came out to him and said, &ldquo;<i>If </i>the
prophet had bid thee <i>do some </i>great thing, wouldest thou not have done <i>it?

</i>how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?&rdquo;  Naaman finally
did this.  He &ldquo;dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of
the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child,
and he was clean.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>To answer anyone who says that there is a difference because
God spoke to Noah directly but He is not speaking to them directly, go to Psalm
19.  We see here starting at verse 7 many references to synonyms to the Word of
God, such as &ldquo;the law of Jehovah,&rdquo; &ldquo;the testimony,&rdquo; &ldquo;the statutes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
commandment,&rdquo; &ldquo;the judgments,&rdquo; etc.  This Psalm is really a mini summary or an
analysis of Psalm 119, a Psalm that uses all of these same phrases to describe
the Word of God, the Bible.  Speaking of the Word of God, the Bible, it says in
Psalm 19:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">More to be desired <i>are they </i>than gold, yea, than much
fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy
servant warned&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are warned by the Bible.  When the watchman sees the
sword coming upon the land, he has an obligation to warn the people.  We sound
the trumpet, and this trumpet is giving a very clear sound.  You may not agree
with what is being declared, but nobody can argue that stating matter-of-factly
with an exclamation point that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day is not clear.  This
is crystal clear.  This is very clear.  Even the worst enemies of the Gospel
and those who are extremely hostile would still have to admit that this is
clear, that what is being stated is very clear.  This is one of the reasons why
they do not like this.  It is such a plain, forthright, and direct statement, &ldquo;This
is the day of judgment!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So where do we come up with this date?  We get this from the
Bible, from the Word of God, through genealogies that are found in the Bible,
which are actually a Biblical calendar of history.  We get this through
statements like what we read in 2 Peter 3 where God says that &ldquo;one day <i>is </i>with
the Lord as a thousand years&rdquo; and through the language of Genesis 7 where God
said to Noah, &ldquo;For yet seven days.&rdquo;  By God&rsquo;s grace, putting it all together,
we find that this is it.  This is it.  This is the end of all things.  </p>

<p>In a household, traditionally, the father has been the one
to lead the house.  This is how God lays this out.  If there is a marriage, it
is the husband, it is the father, it is the man who leads the house.  He is the
one who instructs his household.  </p>

<p>So if there is a man who has children and he understands
these things and he knows and believes that this is true because God has given
him this belief, then he has a duty as a watchman, yes, to warn the whole
world; but he, especially, is to warn his own house and his own family and his
own children and his own wife.  There is an obligation and a responsibility to
warn the people whom God has placed us closest to.  We must share this information
with them and we are to pray for them.  Again, we can try to get them to listen
as much as possible to this information in order that the Lord might have mercy
on them.  </p>

<p>Going back to Hebrews 11, we read in Hebrews 11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith [<i>by Christ</i>] Noah, being warned of God of things
not seen as yet&hellip;  </p>

<p>These two words, &ldquo;as yet,&rdquo; are very important.  God is going
back into history and He is looking at the historical events that surrounded
the flood; and God has this complete view because His perspective is from an
eternal perspective.  He sees the end from the beginning.  Of course, God knew
all along that He was going to destroy the world by a flood.  </p>

<p>So we place ourselves prior to the flood in the days of Noah
when God told a man, a man who was a husband and a father, and then God moved
in him &ldquo;to will and to do of <i>his </i>good pleasure,&rdquo; and Noah got busy. 
Noah started hammering and constructing an ark and building that ship.  I am
sure that he was telling people all along, the whole way, exactly what God had
told him, which was that God was going to destroy the earth because of man&rsquo;s
sin; and so, slowly, he continued working.  </p>

<p>It is a very good thing that this was not me because I
cannot build even a dog house, but God equips people.  We do not know what Noah&rsquo;s
skills were, but God would have equipped him to build this boat.  Maybe Noah
hired help.  There would have been nothing wrong with him doing this.  Maybe he
hired some of the people around him to assist him.  </p>

<p>Noah would have been a very busy man because no one was
paying him to build this ship and this would have taken a lot of time to work
on.  He certainly had other responsibilities if he was living on a farm or on a
ranch or whatever his living circumstances were in order to make enough money
to feed his family and to give him time to build this ship, and so Noah would
have been building this slowly and it began to come together over the course of
time.  </p>

<p>Turn to 1 Peter 3.  We find in 1 Peter 3:18-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit: By which also he&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Christ.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>

<p>This is referring to those in their sins and under the
spiritual bondage that sin brings.  They are in the dungeon, in a way, of the
kingdom of darkness.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; Which sometime&hellip; 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;sometime&rdquo; is better translated &ldquo;aforetime.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">Which [<i>aforetime</i>] were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  </p>

<p>Noah was a &ldquo;preacher of righteousness.&rdquo;  Christ is said here
to have &ldquo;preached unto the spirits in prison&rdquo; prior to the flood.  How did He
do this?  He did this through Noah, which is the same way that this works out
today because we are &ldquo;ambassadors for Christ.&rdquo;  We beseech others &ldquo;in Christ&rsquo;s
stead&rdquo; and on His behalf and in His place, &ldquo;Be ye reconciled to God&rdquo;; and so
Noah would have been building the ark, constructing this ship, and preaching. 
This was a physical illustration itself that was preaching to the people of the
world.  </p>

<p>What would this have been preaching?  If we go back to
Hebrews 11, we again read in Hebrews 11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with
fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the
world&hellip;  </p>

<p>This says that Noah &ldquo;condemned the world.&rdquo;  Why?  Why would building
a ship condemn the world?  He was not doing this quietly to where no one knew
about this, like some people think today.  Some people think that the people of
Noah&rsquo;s day were caught off-guard as if suddenly, without any warning, like a
thief in the night, the world was deluged and everyone drowned except for Noah
and his family.  This is what people say.  </p>

<p>How then were they condemned?  They were condemned because
the building of the ark was for a reason.  The reason was because of man&rsquo;s
sinfulness.  Due to man&rsquo;s sinfulness, God intended to destroy them, to bring
judgment upon them, to complete the condemnation that was already accomplished
by His Word, as it says in John 3.  </p>

<p>In John 3:17, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why not?  We read in the next verse, in John 3:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already&hellip;  </p>

<p>Any unsaved person is already condemned.  The Word of God
has pronounced the judgment, &ldquo;For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death,&rdquo; and people
will be condemned if they remain unsaved.  </p>

<p>So the construction of the ark, especially as it began to
take shape and form and people could see what it was more and more, was a constant
reminder of their sinfulness and of the fact that God&rsquo;s wrath was upon them for
it and that they would be destroyed.  It is likewise today as people hear about
 May 21, 2011.  They, very much, can feel condemned because this is a
condemnation.  </p>

<p>Why?  Why is May 21, 2011 going to be Judgment Day?  It is
because of our sin.  This will be the day of wrath, the day of God&rsquo;s vengeance,
the day of His judgment against man for their rebellion and their
transgressions against His Law.  </p>

<p>Through T-shirts, tracts, vans, hats, verbal communication
with a neighbor or a family member or a friend, we share this information in
whatever way we can.  When it comes down to it, our responsibility is to just
share the information that God has given us concerning Judgment Day.  We are to
share this just as far and as wide as we can with everyone.  As we do, this
information is a source of condemnation; therefore, this is not something that
is easily received by people.  </p>

<p>People do not like to feel like they are being condemned,
nor do we like to feel like we are condemning anyone; but we are not condemning
them.  The Bible tells us that we are to &ldquo;judge no man.&rdquo;  God is the One who is
condemning them.  He is the One who came out with this date, if anyone wants to
blame someone.  As Acts 17 tells us, He is the One who has &ldquo;appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world.&rdquo;  He is also the One who &ldquo;now commandeth all
men every where to repent.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God&rsquo;s people share this information, as it says here of
Noah in Hebrews 11:7:   </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house&hellip;  </p>

<p>The building of the ark was instrumental as God did use it. 
God testified through it.  It was a source of condemnation to the world and
also to the people in Noah&rsquo;s own home.  </p>

<p>Remember what I just read in 1 Peter 3:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which [<i>aforetime</i>] were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  </p>

<p>God was longsuffering in waiting while the ark was
prepared.  What does &ldquo;longsuffering&rdquo; mean?  It means to be patient.  He was
patiently waiting.  Actually, God tells us why He waits.  Why does He not just
destroy the world today?  Why did He not destroy the world a long time before
the flood?  </p>

<p>In 2 Peter 3:15, God gives us information concerning His
patient and longsuffering nature.  We read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">And account <i>that </i>the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is </i>salvation&hellip; 
</p>

<p>What does God mean by &ldquo;account&rdquo;?  As we read about this in
James 5, we can understand that God is the husbandman who &ldquo;waiteth for the
precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive
the early and latter rain.&rdquo;  The implication is that once He receives the rain
and the fruit comes forth, He will no longer be longsuffering.  Therefore, we
can &ldquo;account&rdquo; that His longsuffering nature is for the reason of salvation.  It
equals salvation.  </p>

<p>In other words, God is saving people today.  He is still
saving people today and He will all the way up until the set date.  He is
holding off, just like He did prior to the flood.  This means that God waited
even for eight people!  Today, He is waiting for about 200 million, and people
think that God must hold off because of these many who need to be saved.  Well,
God would hold off even if there was only one because He has guaranteed to save
all of His elect.  </p>

<p>So there were only eight prior to the flood, and yet He
waited for all of them to become saved.  Noah, his wife, and his three sons and
their wives all became saved.  It says in 1 Peter 3 that they were &ldquo;saved by
water.&rdquo;  They were delivered, and God patiently waited until then.  </p>

<p>Was Noah&rsquo;s work in vain as he hammered and hammered away? 
It does not seem that he had any other children, and maybe his sons were just
like children today.  Maybe they were thinking at first, &ldquo;Why does my dad have
to act like a nut?  Why does he have to be loony?  Why does he have to be this
way?  Why can he not be like all of the other dads out there?&rdquo;  I am sure they
thought this and I am sure that children think this today.  I am sure that you
do.  I would have also thought this long ago.  </p>

<p>But, you see, there is a difference here.  Noah really did
know.  He really did have precise and accurate information.  He really knew the
day of judgment.  He knew when the flood was coming.  His children, his sons,
were not very young by the time that the flood finally came.  One of them was
about one hundred years of age just a little while after the flood.  Regardless
of their age, they were witnessed to.  They heard the words, but more
importantly they saw this action, this work.  They saw that Noah was not just
saying it; he was doing it.  You do not spend that period of time building a
boat and not believe it with all of your heart.  This impacted Noah&rsquo;s children
and God used this to the saving of his house.  </p>

<p>I am sorry in some ways that things have to be like this. 
It would be nice if the world was as the world says it is, but the world is not
as the world says it is.  The world lies and the world deceives, but the world
is passing away and we know when.  </p>

<p>So just think of this because we speak now in very definite
terms.  It is Judgment Day, but I understand some who may not be sure.  Just
think, &ldquo;What if Mom and Dad are right?  What if they are right like Noah and
his wife were right?&rdquo;  This is not because of anything in them or in us.  Our
children know us.  We do not have great brains.  We are not the best people,
yet God is capable, which He has done, of hiding His Word and then opening up
His Word.  Now He has revealed these things to His people and He has blessed
us.  He has blessed us with this advance information.  </p>

<p>Let me just look at one more verse in Hebrews 11.  We read in
Hebrews 11:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith [<i>by </i><i>Chris</i><i>t</i>] Isaac blessed Jacob
and Esau concerning things to come.  </p>

<p>Isaac was Jacob and Esau&rsquo;s father.  Isaac knew the Gospel. 
He was a true child of God, and he blessed his sons, Jacob and Esau, twin sons,
&ldquo;concerning things to come.&rdquo;  Jacob and Esau, although twins, were as unalike
as anyone because one was elect and the other was not.  God says, &ldquo;Jacob have I
loved, but Esau have I hated.&rdquo;  Esau never became saved, &ldquo;though he sought it
carefully with tears.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In other words, a father shared all of the information that
he knew to be true &ldquo;concerning things to come&rdquo; and he blessed both sons.  The
saved one and the unsaved one were both informed.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, a father&rsquo;s responsibility ends
there.  We share what we know &ldquo;concerning things to come.&rdquo;  We pray very much
that our children might become saved, but we also know that this is in God&rsquo;s
hands and that He will have mercy upon whom He will have mercy.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
