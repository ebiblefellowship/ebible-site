<p>I thought that it would be good
today to talk a little bit about another tract that Family Radio has.  They
have the &ldquo;HOLY GOD will bring Judgment Day on MAY 21, 2011&rdquo; tract.  Family Radio also has a tract that answers the question that many bring, &ldquo;No Man Knows
the Day or the Hour?&rdquo;  This is also available and they also send this out
freely.  A third tract that they have that I do not think has gotten as much
attention or as much notice is the tract &ldquo;God Gives Another Infallible Proof
that Assures the Rapture Will Occur May 21, 2011.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>This third tract was mainly
developed to show a certain time path, I guess this is what we could call it,
from the cross or April 1 in the year 33 A.D. until May 21 of next year in
2011.  It goes into detail regarding the number of days, which is 722,500 days
from April 1<sup>st</sup> in 33 A.D. to May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  This is a
good tract that lays this out.  </p>

<p>I think that maybe part of the
problem that people are having, since this is not getting as much attention as
the other tracts, is that perhaps people do not understand just how important
it is that 722,500 days breaks down into significant numbers.  These numbers
are 5 x 10 x 17.  Then it doubles it and it is  x 5 x 10 x 17 again.  These
exact numbers are given twice.  </p>

<p>I thought that maybe we could
just think about this a little bit today, because maybe you have already read
this pamphlet and yet you are not assured.  This is an issue that goes right to
the title of this tract, &ldquo;God Gives Another Infallible Proof that Assures the
Rapture Will Occur May 21, 2011&rdquo; because this tract is designed to help people
gain assurance or to know that May 21 of next year will be Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>When we tell people that May 21
of next year is Judgment Day, we are making a declaration.  We are making this
with an exclamation point and not a question mark, right?  We do not bring this
with a question mark.  We are telling people that this will be Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>If we compare this to the book that was written entitled <i>1994?</i>,
it had a question mark at the end of the title.  This question mark said a
lot.  By using a question mark, it was being said that it was a good
possibility that 1994 could be Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>However, when we tell people about May 21, 2011, people are trying many, many things to get us away from the assurance that this day is
Judgment Day.  They often ask, &ldquo;What are you going to do on May 22<sup>nd</sup>
in 2011?  Will you sign over your house?&rdquo;  These kinds of statements are made,
as well as, &ldquo;Can I have all of your belongings if this does not happen?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So these kinds of statements are what some people bring up
because they do not believe this.  They do not believe that this is going to be
Judgment Day, and so it is easy for a person who does not believe to come up
with all kinds of possibilities and scenarios and to think, &ldquo;Certainly, May 22<sup>nd</sup>
will come and there will be no change.  It will just be like any other day.&rdquo; 
This is because they do not believe.  </p>

<p>When we look at the Ninevites in Jonah 3, we find this to be
really amazing.  It is actually more amazing than Jonah being swallowed by the
whale.  In Jonah 3:1-5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey. And
Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>This is an incredible account.  I just stand amazed every
time that I read this because of the Ninevites&rsquo; reaction.  </p>

<p>First, God told Jonah what to preach.  He gave the words. 
He told him:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.  </p>

<p>He did not say, &ldquo;Go to Nineveh and say, &lsquo;God loves you and
has a wonderful plan for your life, people.&rsquo;&rdquo;  God did not tell Jonah to preach
this; but for some reason the churches today think that God wants them to
preach this, that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  </p>

<p>Well, God says in the Bible, &ldquo;Jacob have I loved,&rdquo; which is
true, &ldquo;but Esau have I hated.&rdquo;  Esau represents the unsaved and Jacob
represents the elect, the saved people, and God makes a difference.  He makes a
distinction between the two because unsaved people are not loved by God in the
sense of salvation.  </p>

<p>How could they be loved when they are under His wrath and they
are going to be destroyed, when God is going to kill them forevermore?  This is
not the love where God says, &ldquo;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son.&rdquo;  He gave His Son for the sins of His elect people.  It is those
people whom He loves.  </p>

<p>So it is very revealing that God did not instruct Jonah to preach
love, grace, faith, mercy, compassion, none of this.  We only have this record
of one sentence that God told Jonah to preach:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>This includes two elements: time (forty days), and judgment
at the end of the forty days.  These are the two elements and the Ninevites
heard this message and they believed God.  They sat in sackcloth and ashes and
cried mightily to God, because who could tell if the Lord might &ldquo;turn away from
his fierce anger,&rdquo; from intending to destroy them?  </p>

<p>In other words, they understood that within this message&mdash;a
message of time and judgment and of nothing that was seemingly good or positive&mdash;God
gave them this warning and space to repent out of His goodness, out of His
mercy, out of His love and compassion and gentleness and out of all of the
wonderful things that we know about God.  </p>

<p>This was all included in the warning, else why would God
bother to warn if He was not a merciful God and if it was His intention to just
destroy all of the Ninevites forty days later?  If it were otherwise, He would
not have had to say anything.  He would have just destroyed them because He did
not have to let them know.  They would have continued on in their wicked way
with the evil that was in their hands and they would have perished forty days
later, but God did warn them.  He sent His ambassador.  </p>

<p>Remember that this is what the Bible says about true
believers.  We read in 2 Corinthians 5:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us
the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though
God did beseech <i>you </i>by us: we pray <i>you </i>in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye
reconciled to God.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the individual believer as an
ambassador.  He or she is a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ.  We bring
the Gospel on His behalf, and the Gospel has information concerning judgment
but also information concerning the grace of God that can save people.  When a
believer carries the truth of what the Bible is saying, then they are acting
like an ambassador.  We are bringing the message to that person in God&rsquo;s
stead.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what the Ninevites understood in Jonah 3. 
We read in Jonah 3:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people
of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>This does not say that they believed Jonah.  They believed
God, which is a good example of this principle.  Jonah was an ambassador, and
God&rsquo;s people all throughout history who have brought and continue to bring His
Word are and have been ambassadors.  They are messengers and servants of God. 
They represent God and His Kingdom, and the Ninevites correctly believed God. 
They rightly believed God.  </p>

<p>Why did they believe God?  Why?  Why did the Ninevites
believe God?  Is it because Jonah went into their city and raised the dead? 
Did Jonah go into their city and make the blind see and cleanse the lepers? 
Did he heal all who were sick and make the lame walk?  Did Jonah do any of
this?  </p>

<p>No, Jonah did none of this.  </p>

<p>Did he do any kind of miracle to prove that he was a prophet
of God?  Did he do anything like we find that God&rsquo;s people have done in the New
Testament when they could do miracles?  </p>

<p>Even in the Old Testament, some of God&rsquo;s prophets, like
Elijah or Elisha, were able to raise the dead.  They could stop the rain for a
period of time, according to the will of God.  They were able to do mighty
things, but God did not equip Jonah with any additional things in order to
confirm that he was a true prophet of God.  God only told Jonah, &ldquo;Go unto Nineveh,
that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>It is true that there was a miracle when Jonah was in the
belly of the whale for three days and three nights after God had the whale
swallow Jonah, but we do not read that the Ninevites knew about this.  Did they
know the story of Jonah?  Maybe Jonah told them, but we are not sure.  All we
know and the only record that God gave is Jonah speaking one sentence, &ldquo;Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo; and the people of Nineveh believing
him.  </p>

<p>Were they not foolish?  Were they not naï and gullible
fools!  Those saps!  After all, they did not know this guy.  Those dummies in Nineveh
who would believe such a thing concerning a God who they could not see&mdash;because
they could not see God in their day either&mdash;who sent a so-called prophet to
their city to tell them, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo;

were foolish.  They were supremely foolish.  </p>

<p>On top of all of this, he was not even a Ninevite himself. 
He was not even an Assyrian, which the Ninevites were.  He was a Hebrew, and we
can read of wars between the Assyrians and the Hebrews in the Bible.  He was an
enemy.  The Jews were not their friends.  He was from an enemy nation.  </p>

<p>Did he even speak their language?  God does not tell us.  As
a matter of fact, everything that you would not want in a prophet, Jonah was. 
He went to this city reluctantly.  He went a day&rsquo;s journey, though it would
have been a three-day long journey to cover the whole city, and he spoke a
single sentence, and yet they believed God.  </p>

<p>This is incredible!  This is absolutely incredible that from
the king on down, the people of Nineveh repented, sat in sackcloth and ashes, fasted,
and cried mightily to God.  God does not tell us how long they did this, only
that what they did was acceptable in His sight.  </p>

<p>We find out in the New Testament that Jesus says that the
men of Nineveh will rise in the judgment to condemn some of the unsaved, which
indicates that the Ninevites were really saved people and that God did a real
work of salvation amongst the people of Nineveh concerning this one-sentence
warning that Jonah gave them.  Yet when we look at this with the reasoning of
man, with the natural mind, it just does not make any sense that they would
believe God.  </p>

<p>Let us put it this way.  How many infallible proofs did God
provide the Ninevites?  He did not provide any, did He, that we know of?  He
gave no assurance to them that in forty days, they would be overthrown.  </p>

<p>They certainly would have had their people respond just like
we have people today who are cynical and skeptical.  These are not just modern
traits.  These are traits within man: unbelief, disbelief.  It is natural and
easy to doubt and to not believe things, and yet the people of Nineveh believed
God.  They believed God.  </p>

<p>Why is this?  Have you read the &ldquo;HOLY GOD/Judgment Day&rdquo;
tract?  Have you read the &ldquo;No Man Knows the Day or the Hour?&rdquo; tract?  Have you
read this tract, &ldquo;God Gives Another Infallible Proof that Assures the Rapture
Will Occur May 21, 2011&rdquo;?  Have you read <i>We Are Almost There</i>?  Have you
read <i>To God be the Glory!</i> or <i>I Hope GOD Will Save Me</i>?  Do you
still not believe?  </p>

<p>You do not believe.   You are not thinking that May 21 of
2011 will be Judgment Day.  You are trying not to think about it, actually. 
You want to just continue on with life as normal as though this day is not
going to happen.  &ldquo;I am not going to be a fool!  I am not going to be
gullible!  I am not going to be deceived into thinking that man can actually
know Judgment Day, that he can know the time of the end of the world.  Come on;
who do you think I am?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, actually, I think that you are a normal human being. 
I think that you are a normal person because man naturally has a heart of stone
and a heart of unbelief and does not, of his own, believe God.  It does not
matter how much evidence is presented.  It does not matter.  </p>

<p>Let us just look at one other example of someone who is
naï enough to believe something pretty quickly.  In John 1:47-50, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when
thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto
him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus
answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig
tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  </p>

<p>Nathanael was easily convinced, very easily convinced.  All
Jesus said was that He had seen him under the fig tree.  Of course, Christ would
do many &ldquo;greater things.&rdquo;  This was not anything in comparison to all of the
mighty acts performed by the Lord Jesus Christ in order to demonstrate that He
was the Messiah and that He was the Son of God.  </p>

<p>Nathanael, for some reason, had been a skeptic, as we read
in John 1:45-46:  </p>

<p class="verse">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,
of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the
son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out
of Nazareth?&hellip;  </p>

<p>He was very skeptical, very cynical:  </p>

<p class="verse">Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?  </p>

<p>Immediately, Jesus speaks just a few words:  </p>

<p class="verse">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig
tree, I saw thee.  </p>

<p>And Nathanael replies:  </p>

<p class="verse">Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  </p>

<p>Basically, he was saying, &ldquo;You are the Messiah!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why such a dramatic change?  What caused Nathanael to
immediately understand and believe this?  </p>

<p>Jesus looked like any man.  He was not anything special in
His appearance, but He did have a human body.  He made this one statement and
what caused Nathanael to believe?  </p>

<p>The answer is found in Christ&rsquo;s declaration:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  </p>

<p>He was truly saved.  Christ had saved Him; and when Christ
saves someone, He gives them ears to hear and He gives them eyes to see.  </p>

<p>Look at John 8:46:    </p>

<p class="verse">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
do ye not believe me?  </p>

<p>This is Jesus speaking.  This is a good question:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;why do ye not believe me?  </p>

<p>Why not?  Why do you not believe God about Judgment Day? 
Why do you not believe?  </p>

<p>The answer is found in John 8:47:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>It is really simple.  It is very simple.  The reason why the
Ninevites believed, the reason why so many people today do not believe, the
reason why the people prior to the flood did not believe Noah, the reason why Lot&rsquo;s
sons-in-law looked at him as one who mocked, the reason is what Jesus says in
John 8:47:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the reason:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>The reason is not due to a lack of sufficient evidence.  It
is a lie to believe this.  This is not the reason why someone does not
understand Judgment Day or why someone does not understand the five months of
torment or any of this.  It is not because of insufficient evidence.  The Ninevites
have shown us that belief in the truth can come with no evidence.  None.  </p>

<p>All of this information today is being presented to people. 
It is being shown to them and some people are reading it.  Yet after they read
it, they say, &ldquo;Tell me more.  What else do you have?&rdquo;  Some are a little
disappointed, &ldquo;Come on; give me another tract.  Give me another booklet that I
can read.&rdquo;  But this is not going to help and it is not going to convince
them.  </p>

<p>As we have said here several times, someone could give those
who do not believe an encyclopedia of evidence from the Bible, lay it at their
feet, they could read it and it still would not help.  It will not help because
the problem goes much deeper.  The problem is in the heart.  The problem is a
dead heart that generates dead ears.  People in this condition do not believe
because they cannot believe.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 11:20-24.  Again, this is Jesus in view.  It
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto
thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done
in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But
I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of
judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven,
shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in
thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say
unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
judgment, than for thee.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;mighty works&rdquo; of Jesus that we read about in the
Gospels were done in plain view and in plain sight.  Christ would heal someone,
like the man who was let down by his friends.  Christ would heal them in front
of a crowd that was all around Him.  He would heal the blind.  He would raise
the dead, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>He did all of this and many other things, and yet He says
here in Matthew 11 that He had done many &ldquo;mighty works&rdquo; in certain cities and
it did not produce faith.  It did not produce belief.  It did not lead to
salvation.  It did not lead those people to an understanding of who Christ was
and is.  It did not accomplish what some people think, &ldquo;Show me; show me and
then I will believe.  Show me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Hebrews 3:7-9.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation
in the wilderness: When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
forty years.  </p>

<p>What did they see?  They saw manna falling from Heaven every
day.  What a miracle!  They saw water gushing like a river out of a rock.  They
saw incredible things.  Their shoes did not wear out as they wandered for forty
years in a desolate wilderness.  Many times, they saw God&rsquo;s mighty works.  They
saw the crossing of the Red Sea, as the Lord divided the waters asunder, and
yet they did not believe.  </p>

<p>It did not matter what incredible feat God might do right in
front of their eyes: it never led to belief.  This is what God is saying here. 
They saw His works forty years, and then we read in Hebrews 3:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
alway err in <i>their </i>heart; and they have not known my ways. So I sware in
my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) Take heed, brethren, lest there
be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  </p>

<p>Also, Hebrews 3:17-19 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But with whom was he grieved forty years? <i>was it </i>not with
them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? And to whom sware
he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So
we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.  </p>

<p>Now chapter four, Hebrews 4:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <i>us </i>of
entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us
was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not
profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>This is a warning for the Jews and this is a warning for
us.  Let us fear unless the same condition come upon us.  </p>

<p>Actually, it has come upon the churches and congregations. 
God speaks of them as those &ldquo;which have eyes to see, and see not; they have
ears to hear, and hear not.&rdquo;  They are not believing God at this time with the
information that He is opening up from the Bible, the Scriptures.  They simply
dismiss it, and the reason is due to unbelief.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at Acts 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many
infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God:  </p>

<p>So God gave proof after His resurrection.  He showed
people.  He appeared to people repeatedly.  Some people were God&rsquo;s elect and
they believed.  They glorified God and understood that Jesus had risen from the
dead.  But many amongst the Jews and amongst the people of that day did not
believe, despite infallible proofs, despite God confirming that it was a fact
that Jesus had died and had risen from the dead.  </p>

<p>Many still do not believe up until today.  The Bible itself
is a record.  It is a testimony.  It is a witness to the fact that Jesus rose
from the dead, and yet we have all kinds of people who disbelieve.  They do not
believe in the resurrection or in God, in Christ.  </p>

<p>The proofs themselves are not the problem.  Again, it goes
to the heart of the individual, the heart of man who thinks he knows better. 
Man thinks that he knows better than God, that wisdom rests with the
individual.  They think that they have this all figured out.  They think that
they know the future.  They must because many of them who think this will say, &ldquo;I
will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup> in 2011.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They must think that they know the future as well as God
because what they are doing is making their own prophecy.  They are prophesying
and they are saying, &ldquo;May 22, 2011 will come as usual.  It will arrive
normally.  There will be no rapture.  There will be no resurrection.  I will
see you on that date.  If you would take my challenge, you would give me your
house on that day.&rdquo;  But, you see, this is man with his finite wisdom pitting
himself against Infinite God, who is Wisdom Himself, and trying to say that
this day will not come, that this day will not be here.  </p>

<p>So I just want to look at a few proofs, a couple of which
are in this tract, and it would be good for anyone to carefully read this
tract.  One proof is the 7,000 years.  We find this on the first page of the
tract where &ldquo;one day <i>is </i>with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day&rdquo; is discussed.  </p>

<p>If we turn to Genesis 7:4, this is after the Lord is
addressing Noah and He is continuing to speak to Him.  He says:    </p>

<p class="verse">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I
destroy from off the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>So God is telling Noah exactly when the flood will come.  It
would come seven days from the day that He is speaking to him, &ldquo;For yet seven
days.&rdquo;  This was the 10<sup>th</sup> day of Noah&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> month in his
600<sup>th</sup> year.  Noah could calculate that seven days from then would be
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of his 600<sup>th</sup>

year.  It was one week.  </p>

<p>This goes to answer many of the people who say that we
cannot know the day or hour.  God says this in Matthew 24:36; but immediately
following this statement, He says that the coming of the Son of Man will be as
it was in the days of Noah.  When we go back into history, we find that before
bringing the flood, God forewarned Noah and his family and they were able to
escape the flood and to enter into the ark to find safety and refuge.  </p>

<p>Here God says to Noah, &ldquo;For yet seven days,&rdquo; and in 2 Peter
3, in the context of the flood, in the first few verses, followed by the
context of the end of this present world by fire, we read in 2 Peter 3:8:   </p>

<p class="verse">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i>is
</i>with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  </p>

<p>In setting this within the context of the flood, God is
telling us that we can go back to Genesis 7 and we can substitute one day for a
thousand years.  Not only this, but He repeats this to indicate that this is
certain and that this will shortly to come to pass, which it will in our day.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, when God tells Noah, &ldquo;Yet seven days and I will
bring the flood,&rdquo; He is saying, &ldquo;Yet seven thousand years and I will bring
destruction upon the world.  You have this space of time to enter into Christ,
into the salvation of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This evidence is very straightforward, very clear, because
the Lord has also opened up the Biblical calendar of history and He has shown
us that the flood occurred in 4990 B.C.  When we add 7,000 years to this, we arrive
at the year 2011.  This is one of the infallible proofs.  </p>

<p>We can be sure that if 7,000 years from the flood were to
arrive at 2150 A.D., the people of our day would not be all that upset.  They
would not be all that bothered by this information.  But since this is in our
generation, not only in our generation but next year, many people are troubled
by the information coming from the Bible that states that next year will be the
7,000<sup>th</sup> anniversary from the flood.  This is a very major thing.  </p>

<p>For a second proof, let us go back to Genesis 7.  This is
not in the tract, but I think that this is a big evidence, a big proof that God
has given us that Judgment Day will be next year.  He says in Genesis 7:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.  </p>

<p>It was seven days later, just like next year will be after
7,000 years when it will come to pass that God will bring about His judgment on
the earth.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 7:11-16:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the six hundredth year of Noah&rsquo;s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was
upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the selfsame day entered Noah,
and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah&rsquo;s wife, and the
three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; They, and every beast after
his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein <i>is </i>the breath of life. And they that went in, went in
male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and JEHOVAH shut him
in.</p>

<p>So the Lord got everyone into the ark, the eight people and
all of the animals.  Then on that 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, He shut the door.  God secured the door, which secured the safety of
everyone in the ark and guaranteed the destruction of everyone outside of the
ark.  </p>

<p>Remember that the Bible says that God is the One who &ldquo;openeth,
and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth.&rdquo;  So no one could open
this door, the door that God had shut on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

month.  </p>

<p>Next year is 2011, 7,000 years from the flood, but where
does this 7,000<sup>th</sup> year fall in 2011?  Is it in January?  Is it in
April?  Is it in August?  Is it in October?  How do we know where this falls? 
How do we know what day this lands on?  </p>

<p>Well, completely apart from the 7,000 years, it has been
known for many years now, as you can read the book <i>The End of the Church Age&hellip;and
After</i> by Mr. Camping, that the church age came to an end the day before
Pentecost in 1988.  The day before was the end of the church age, May 21, 1988, and it was the beginning of the Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p>So how long would the Great Tribulation be?  </p>

<p>As God&rsquo;s people searched the Bible, it was discovered that
the Great Tribulation would be 23 years from 1988.  Actually, there were
several possibilities.  There was 2300 days, 23 years, 7 years, or 70 years. 
These were the four possibilities.  </p>

<p>I do not know if any of you are aware of this.  Back in
1994, the reason that Mr. Camping put 1994 as the possible end with a question
mark was because he knew that the Great Tribulation began in 1988 and he knew
the date that it would end.  This is in the book <i>1994?</i>  But because of a
verse in Matthew 24 that says, &ldquo;but for the elect&rsquo;s sake those days shall be
shortened,&rdquo; he thought that instead of 23 years&mdash;which he wrote about in the
book <i>1994?</i> where he indicated the year 2011&mdash;the actual time could be
2300 days, from 1988 to September of 1994, and yet this was a mistake.  It was
not 2300 days.  We know this for sure.  This is no longer a possibility.  We
now know that it is 23 years and that it goes from 1988 to 2011.  </p>

<p>So what is an exact 23-year period from the end of the
church age to the end of the Great tribulation?  </p>

<p>This period is from May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011.  All of this was discovered years ago and this was accomplished completely apart from
anything having to do with the 7,000 years from the flood.  No one was talking
about &ldquo;one day <i>is </i>with the Lord as a thousand years&rdquo; and substituting
the 7,000 years for the 7 days years ago when it was worked out that the Great
Tribulation would be 23 years, as 23 is a number that God identifies with
judgment.  </p>

<p>If you remember when Israel committed idolatry, the Bible
says that 23,000 fell in one day.  It was actually stated as 24,000 in another
verse, but God says that in one day it was 23,000 to emphasize judgment.  </p>

<p>How many kings of Israel were there before they were
destroyed?  There were 23 kings of Israel.  How many kings of Judah were there
before they were destroyed?  There were 23 kings of Judah.  They both shared
the first three kings of Saul, David, and Solomon.  Then each one had a series
of twenty kings.  God destroyed Israel in the north by the Assyrians after the
23<sup>rd</sup> king.  Then Judah had a longer period of time because their
kings tended to reign longer; and yet after the 23<sup>rd</sup> king, God
destroyed them through the Babylonians.  In many places, He is telling us that
23 equals judgment.  </p>

<p>The flood came 6,023 years from creation, and so judgment
came in 4990 B.C.  From the flood to the cross was 5,023 years inclusive, and
then judgment came on the Lord Jesus Christ in 33 A.D.  Again and again, God
works this out.  From creation, which was 11,013 B.C., until 1988 was 13,000
years exactly, plus 23 years gets us to 2011 and it is Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>All of this other information had been worked out completely
separately.  The 23 years from May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011 are also exactly 8400 days.  A day cannot be moved anywhere.  It is exactly 8400 days.  This is
like 7 years because another possible option for the Great Tribulation is 84
months.  In 70 years, another option is 840 months.  The three and a half days
of Revelation 11 is 84 hours.  From May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011 is 8400 days exactly.  </p>

<p>So God is guaranteeing and confirming that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  It is Judgment Day, but this is not the proof.  This is not
the infallible proof.  The infallible proof comes when we look at the calendar,
but not our calendar.  In the Gregorian calendar, it will be May 21, 2011; but the infallible proof comes when we look at the Hebrew calendar.  It is
not the Mayan calendar.  It is not the Russian calendar.  It is not the Chinese
calendar.  It is the Hebrew calendar, the Biblical calendar that we look at. 
This is pertinent because God used this Biblical calendar at times.  If you go
to a Hebrew calendar converter website [<i>for example:</i> <a
href="http://www.hebcal.com/converter/">http://www.hebcal.com/converter/</a>]
and put in May 21, 2011, it will give you the Hebrew date.  May 21, 2011 is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  It is the 17<sup>th</sup>

day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hebrew month.  </p>

<p>I listened and listened to this fact, and then one day it
just rang true.  The 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month is the day
when God shut Noah and his family and the animals into the ark.  It is the very
same day.  </p>

<p>Is this a coincidence?  I do not know what the mathematical
odds are, but it is staggering to realize that all of this other information
could have been worked out and that someone deliberately, or even if this were
to have happened coincidentally, could have arranged for things to fall on this
particular day.  How could anyone have arranged for May 21, 2011 to be the end
of the 23-year Great Tribulation, which is also the 8400<sup>th</sup> day, and
for this to be the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of the
Hebrew calendar, which also coincides with the date that God shut Noah into the
ark, and in addition to all of this, have it be exactly 7,000 years later on
that very day?    </p>

<p>Well, do you believe?  Do you believe this?  The proof is
not the problem.  The evidence is not the problem.  The proof is incredible. 
The proof confirms what we have been learning from the Bible, which is that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>There is another proof that is not in this tract but I think
goes right along and completely in keeping with May 21, 2011 being Judgment
Day, but a problem exists because there were three main feasts: the Feast of
Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles/Ingathering
where God specified that all of the males in Israel were to present themselves
in observing these three feasts.  </p>

<p>God fulfilled each feast spiritually.  The Passover was
fulfilled on April 1 in 33 A.D.  It was a Passover day on that Friday when
Jesus was on the cross.  He is &ldquo;the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
the world.&rdquo;  It just so happens that they were slaying the Passover lamb the
very day that Jesus was on the cross in &ldquo;the fulness of the time.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It was &ldquo;the fulness of the time.&rdquo;  After 11,000 years, the
Messiah comes and God arranges for Him to be on the cross on the exact day that
the Passover lamb is being sacrificed.  This is about as coincidental as the 17<sup>th</sup>

day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month in the Hebrew calendar falling on May 21, 2011, which means that it is not coincidental at all.  </p>

<p>God is a brilliant God.  He is the great mathematician.  He
is the One who created the world; and in the very fabric of all things, He has
built in math.  This same God worked it all out that Jesus, in &ldquo;the fulness of
the time,&rdquo; would be exactly where He needed to be to observe this feast.  </p>

<p>Then on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit is poured
out.  So the Feast of Pentecost was observed into the church age, and then God
again fulfilled this feast.  </p>

<p>The third feast is the Feast of Tabernacles/Feast of
Ingathering, which has everything to do with the end of the world.  This is
because God likens Himself to a husbandman who &ldquo;waiteth for the precious fruit
of the earth,&rdquo; which is referring to His people, His saved people.  He wants to
gather them in.  He wants to bring in the harvest, and this is what this last feast
has to do with.  </p>

<p>The problem is that this feast in 2011 is in October.  The
last day of this feast will be October 21, 2011, which is far away from May 21, 2011.  It is far away.  There are five months in between.  There are five months
that distinguish Judgment Day on May 21 and the last day of the Feast of
Tabernacles/Ingathering on October 21.  </p>

<p>Here is an infallible proof.  In Genesis 7, the same chapter
where God said to Noah, &ldquo;Yet seven days and I will bring the flood,&rdquo; the same
chapter when God shut the door on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, which May 21, 2011 is equivalent to, from this 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, it says in Genesis 7:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days.  </p>

<p>This was a period of five months.  This was a period of five
months of Noah&rsquo;s calendar, which was a calendar of 30-day months.  5 x 30 is
150, and this is another thing that you might have to stop and think about or
maybe one day it will hit you like it hit me.  </p>

<p>God already has in this chapter the 7 days or the 7,000
years.  He has the very day that the door was shut on the ark&mdash;and, by the way,
John 10 tells us that Christ is the door&mdash;so this is the day that salvation
ends.  God is not going to save anyone past this day.  Never again will anyone
go through this door, who is Christ, into Heaven after May 21 of next year.  </p>

<p>God has this in this chapter, and this fits with May 21, 2011.  Then the next time reference that we read about is a 150 days or five
months when the waters were prevailing, and we happen to have this gap of five
months, between May 21 and October 21.  </p>

<p>Is this a coincidence?  Five months exactly are in view when
the waters prevailed, which has everything to do with the Judgment of God.  So,
too, on May 21, the wrath of God will begin to be poured out; but there is this
last feast that has to be connected to the end of the world somehow.  This
feast has to be fulfilled, and now we know that there will be five months of torment,
as Revelation 9 says; and this fits perfectly, perfectly, in place.  </p>

<p>In this same chapter, why does it not say 180 days?  Why
does it not say 529 days?  Why does it say that for 150 days, the waters
prevailed?  This is because God is confirming to us that we have this correct. 
This is an infallible proof.  He is assuring us of this.  </p>

<p>So this all fits perfectly and exactly.  Therefore, we can
know and we should know that May 21 of next year is Judgment Day.  You do not
have to doubt and you do not have to think about the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of
May, because we know what is going to be going on on the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of
May.  For a period of five months, this will be a world in utter chaos and
torment and sorrow.  </p>

<p>Well, there is much more evidence, much more, but how much
more do we need?  We keep coming back to this same question.  How much more
does a person need to believe?  </p>

<p>The answer to this question is that they need a new heart
and a new spirit.  They need the Spirit of God within them to hear God&rsquo;s
voice.  They need to hear the Shepherd&rsquo;s voice so that they can follow and so that
they can believe and so that they can understand.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
