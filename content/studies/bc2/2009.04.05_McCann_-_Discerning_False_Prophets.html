<p>Lately, the last three to four weeks, we have opened up a
room on Paltalk in the Christianity section that is titled &ldquo;May 21 2011 The Rapture&rdquo; 
We have had that room open twice a week, Tuesday and Thursday nights.  People
have been coming in and you can tell that many people who are in churches and
congregations are coming in.  </p>

<p>They have been, in a sense, discussing the nature of that room,
which is that we are saying that Christ is coming at a specific time, a
specific date, and that God is going to bring judgment on the world.  That idea
attracts people and they are coming in.  </p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of times, before they have really
heard anything, they will put out a verse from the Bible that says, &ldquo;No man
knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  Following that, they will make a statement like, &ldquo;You
are teaching falsely; you are a false prophet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I thought that was kind of interesting because normally you
wait until it does not happen before you label someone a false prophet, before
you say, &ldquo;This is not of God,&rdquo; but many people are not waiting.  They are not
waiting and they are saying right now that anyone who would give a date for the
return of Christ is a false prophet.  </p>

<p>So I thought that it would be good to look at what the Bible
has to say about false prophets, because people have it in their minds that if
you give a date you are acting like a prophet.  Since all previous dates that
have been given in history were wrong, you are automatically a false prophet.  </p>

<p>However, if you think about what the Bible has to say about
false prophets, is there anywhere in the Bible that points to an individual who
gave a date and the date did not come to pass so they are called a false
prophet?  Is that the definition of a false prophet?  </p>

<p>I cannot think of anyplace in the Bible.  Yes, there are
times in the Bible where a prophet would prophecy a future event, because God
moved them to prophecy of the coming Messiah, of the Lord Jesus Christ entering
into the world; there are Scriptures like that.  But actually, and I will say
virtually, there is no record in the Bible of someone who prophesies of a date
and it does not come to pass where everyone goes, &ldquo;Aha!  You are a false
prophet!&rdquo;  There is nothing like that in the Bible.  </p>

<p>The Bible&rsquo;s idea of a false prophet really is entirely
different.  A false prophet, which we will look at today, is someone whose
characteristics you might be very surprised at.  You really might be very
surprised at what the Bible will label a false prophet.  </p>

<p>Now, there is something that I have learned and have been
telling people, because their response is so easy and so quick; it is just a
snap of the fingers.  When someone hears that we have very little time left and
that Christ is coming and that this is a matter-of-fact declaration because the
Bible teaches this and they say, &ldquo;No, the Rapture will not take place on May
21, 2011; Christ is not coming on that date; you are a false prophet; that is
not going to happen; the world will not end in 2011,&rdquo; what are they doing? 
They are prophesying; they are prophesying.  It is a negative prophecy, but it
is a prophecy; it is very much a prophecy.  </p>

<p>They are saying that God is not going to do this.  A lot of
times, it is very superficial.  They throw out that verse, which we have
discussed the last couple of weeks, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not so;
no way.&rdquo;  Well, they had better watch out.  They had better be careful because
they have just prophesied.  They just prophesied, so we will try to take a look
at this.  </p>

<p>Let us go to just a couple of passages to get us into the
subject.  In 2 Peter 2:1-2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of
whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>

<p>When the Bible speaks of false prophets, they are normally
in large numbers; that is normally the case.  In the days of Israel when
Elijah, the true prophet of God, was bringing the Word to the people of Israel,
there were four hundred and fifty [<i>note: speaker inadvertently said &ldquo;four
hundred&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;four hundred and fifty&rdquo;</i>] prophets of Baal who came to
the contest on Mount Carmel to show who was the Lord&rsquo;s prophet and who was not,
plus hundreds of prophets of the groves.  But of the Lord, representing the
Lord and the Word of God, there was one man, Elijah, one man, one single
individual.  </p>

<p>So that is something that we have to consider, that false
prophets are normally numerous and many follow them.  Many will follow their
pernicious ways or ways that lead to damnation and destruction.  Many there are
who go down the broad way.  Few there are who follow the narrow road that leads
to life.  That is two things for us to keep in mind.  False prophets are
normally popular.  They are normally popular and many follow their teachings.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to 1 John 4.  This is very good instruction
that the Lord has given to every person in 1 John 4:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
they are of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>Whether God is saying &ldquo;Gospel&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; it
is all the same thing.  They are synonyms for the Word, the Bible.  If people
come and they say, &ldquo;This is what the Bible says,&rdquo; then they are preaching Christ. 
They are saying, &ldquo;This is of the Spirit of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is saying to the beloved, to true believers:  </p>

<p class="verse">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but <span class="underline">try</span> the spirits&hellip; </p>

<p>And that word &ldquo;try&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;discern&rdquo; or &ldquo;prove&rdquo; in
some places.  So the beloved, the child of God is to examine.  It is also the
word &ldquo;prove&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 13.  It is to make sure that what you are hearing
is true.  Why?  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false
prophets are gone out into the world.  </p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t we know it.  Don&rsquo;t we know it!  How many people
profess to be Christians today?  Nearly or about two billion.  Wow!  Two
billion in the world.  Almost about one-third of the world&rsquo;s population, which
covers everything under the sun: Catholics, Protestants, Independents,
Charismatics, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Mormons.  That is the whole conglomerate. 
It is the whole collection of those who profess to be Christian.  </p>

<p>So there are many and their prophecies or their gospels or
their teachings from the Bible conflict with one another.  They are teaching
things that do not agree with one another and, therefore, we know that many of
them are wrong and that they are not teaching the truth.  </p>

<p>God is saying to every person&mdash;especially in our day, this is
so&mdash;try the spirits to see if it is from God; that is, check it out in the Bible. 
When you hear something, go to the Bible to see if it is so.  Search the
Scriptures, like the Bereans whom God identified as being noble because they
were checking the Bible when they heard new things to see if God had said it in
His Word.  The reason is because it is very easy to follow a false prophet. 
Well, not for a child of God.  But for the masses, it is very easy for them to
go after somebody, no matter how crazy their teaching might be or
off-the-wall.  </p>

<p>Also, in 1 John 4, for a little bit more information, it
says in verse 5, 1 John 4:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
the world heareth them.  </p>

<p>Which explains a lot.  It explains a lot because the vast
majority of people in the world are unsaved.  God is saving a great multitude
today.  He is going to save two hundred million people all through history,
with the great majority of those today in the last days of the Great
Tribulation.  That is a lot of people; but still, if all two hundred million
came out of seven billion today, that would leave six billion+ who are not
going to be saved.  Therefore, they are not understanding the truth or the true
spirit because they do not have ears to hear.  </p>

<p>This explains why there can be mega churches with paltry
gospels.  You can have mega churches, a huge response to a social gospel, to a
political gospel, to a gospel that teaches falsely, to a gospel that is very
moral and humane and wants to help the neighborhood.  You can have all of that
and people respond, sometimes in masses, especially if there is a charismatic
individual who has a way with words, who is very eloquent and very dramatic and
who can motivate people and stir up their emotions.  </p>

<p>You can fill whole stadiums actually with crusades.  You can
have sixty to seventy thousand people at a stadium and they can be doing the
wave and falling down the aisles where great impact, it seems, is made upon
their hearts, and yet none of that is true.  It is all physical; it is all
natural; it is all emotional; it is all on a level that is apart from the
spiritual nature of the Gospel that has to impact the heart itself and change a
man&rsquo;s heart.  </p>

<p>It is not about getting someone to start crying.  Of course,
there is nothing wrong with mourning over sin; however, it has to be done in a
true and right way.  God is the One who will bring conviction to an
individual.  Yet this explains why you can have a church that numbers hundreds
of millions of people, and so on, and people love the appearance of their
leader because:  </p>

<p class="verse">They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
the world heareth them.</p>

<p>Then it says in verse 6, 1 John 4:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of
error.  </p>

<p>God has to give us ears to hear.  It really will finally
come down to that.  Ultimately, we will not be able to discern truth from a lie
or a true prophet from a false prophet unless we are one of God&rsquo;s elect and He
gives us ears to hear.  Otherwise, you will not be able to distinguish; you
will not be able to tell the difference and you will be caught in the snare
that false prophets bring.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Deuteronomy 13 in the Old Testament.  God has
many things to say about false prophets throughout the Bible.  It says in
Deuteronomy 13:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass,
whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast
not known, and let us serve them;</p>

<p>You see, there is nothing here about dates.  There is
nothing here about predicting the coming of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus.  It is
simply someone who is saying something in the Name of the Lord; however, he is
leading people to other gods.  Every time that we teach falsely, if we would
teach a falsehood, this is what it is doing; it is leading people to another
kind of a god than the true God.  </p>

<p>So God is saying, &ldquo;Okay, if this happens, here is what I say
about it.&rdquo;  Verse 3, Deuteronomy 13:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
dreamer of dreams: for JEHOVAH your God proveth you, to know whether ye love
JEHOVAH your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after
JEHOVAH your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice,
and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And that prophet, or that dreamer
of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn <i>you </i>away
from JEHOVAH your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which JEHOVAH
thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the
midst of thee.  </p>

<p>Now, God is letting us know, and it is interesting that this
is in the frame of signs and wonders, &ldquo;If they are leading you after other gods,
then no, I have not sent them no matter what the sign or wonder is.  No matter
how good they sound, I have not sent them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is such a serious offence that he is to be put to death
for being a false prophet, &ldquo;Put him to death,&rdquo; and that is said in a few places
in the Bible.  This was the death penalty that God instituted for false
prophecy.  We can see from this passage and from other passages in the
Scripture how the church, throughout the early years of the Church Age and
actually into the Middle Ages of the Church Age, would get the idea, since they
thought that they were the authority of the Bible, that if anyone contradicted
their teaching and their authority, then they were a heretic, that it was
heresy what they were saying.  </p>

<p>What they were saying in many cases, actually, was not
heresy, according to the Bible because the Bible, which was what they were
reading and declaring, was in opposition to the church&rsquo;s traditions and its
teachings, to the church&rsquo;s doctrines.  Yet since the church thought that they
were the authority and that whatever they said should be accepted and that no
one should dare contradict them, &ldquo;We will put you to death; we will put you to
death,&rdquo; and they did that.  They did this many times, we know, in the early
days.  In the early years of the church, into the Middle Ages, men of God, true
men of God were called heretics.  </p>

<p>What is a heretic?  It is a false prophet.  They were
called, labeled, identified, as a false prophet for wanting the Bible in the
language of the people and bringing the Gospel to the people.  Some of these
men were slain in various ways.  Many were burned at the stake at the time of
the Reformation because they were saying, &ldquo;No, the Bible does not teach
indulgences.  The Bible does not teach that the church is the authority but
that the Word of God is the supreme authority.&rdquo;  They also were slain, labeled
as heretics and their teachings as heresies and put to death as false prophets,
and the church that had great numbers of people were the ones behind it.  Many
false prophets are out there in the world.  </p>

<p>It was just a few individuals, they numbered hundreds or
even a few thousand, who would have suffered the flames of fire as they were
taken to the stake and burned.  It was only a remnant of people.  They stood
for the Word of God and yet, in the eyes of many, they were false prophets.  </p>

<p>I do not like to be called a false prophet.  I do not like
that.  I do not like to be labeled as being a cult member.  I do not like it
when people say, &ldquo;It is heresy and you are a heretic!&rdquo;  I do not like it;
however, some people of God have died with that label and I do not think that I
am above them.  I do not think that I am better than them, definitely not.  If
they died in the flames, that actually makes it rather appealing.  </p>

<p>Do you know that the Lord Jesus was said to have Beelzebub? 
&ldquo;Beelzebub!  He deceiveth the people!,&rdquo; the Jews said.  When He was having His
trial, they brought false witnesses who made the accusation, &ldquo;This deceiver
said&hellip;&rdquo;  He was labeled a deceiver.  That is one of the names of Christ
according to the Jews of His day, a deceiver, which makes that a name that is
also honorable if it is said of you because you happen to be supporting what
the Word of God says.  You are just saying what the Bible teaches and yet you
are called a deceiver.  </p>

<p>We have voicemail now and we are getting some messages.  It
does not ring at my house anymore because some people were calling upset when
they got the tract &ldquo;The Rapture May 21, 2011.&rdquo;  A mother in Idaho called me
upset that her teenage boy had gotten a tract.  She told me that she was part
of a Reformed Church and that she did not want this kind of information going
to her son.  Well, I thought about my children getting that kind of phone call,
so we have voicemail and we are taking care of it another way.  </p>

<p>This week, a pastor called because he wants to talk to me. 
He believes that we are deceiving the world, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please stop deceiving
the world?&rdquo;  But, you see, that is the common picture.  It is easy to say about
those who are bringing the Gospel, &ldquo;You are a deceiver; you are an antichrist;
you are a false prophet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Yet, what does the Bible say about false prophets?  Let us
go to Jeremiah 37, beginning in verse 6, Jeremiah 37:6-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came the word of JEHOVAH unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Thus saith JEHOVAH, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah,
that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh&rsquo;s army, which is come
forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. And the Chaldeans
shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with
fire.</p>

<p>See, God gave a little reprieve to Jerusalem.  As the army
of Egypt gathered together and came up, the Babylonians or the Chaldeans fled. 
They left and so there was rejoicing in the city, &ldquo;Oh, this is wonderful!  This
is great!  The Lord has delivered us!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But Jeremiah is saying, &ldquo;No, no, do not trust in the
Egyptians; do not trust in that army.&rdquo;  In Isaiah, God calls them a &ldquo;bruised
reed&rdquo; [<i>note: translated as &ldquo;broken reed&rdquo; in Isaiah 36:6</i>].  &ldquo;Do not lean
upon them, because, still, the Chaldeans will come again and fight against this
city and take it and burn it with fire.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>That is not pleasant news.  That is not good news.  But this
is what the Word of the Lord says.  This is what God says in His Word.  It is
what He moved Jeremiah the prophet to declare again and again and again: judgment,
wrath, evil tidings against this city, against this place, against this land,
and against this people, repeatedly, over and over again, even when there was a
period where it seemed, &ldquo;Maybe we can find deliverance; maybe we can be
rescued; maybe God will fight for us.&rdquo;  No, no.  It was not going to happen.  </p>

<p>Well, then a little further down in verse 13, Jeremiah went
to the gate of Benjamin, and it says in Jeremiah 37:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward <i>was
</i>there, whose name <i>was </i>Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of
Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the
Chaldeans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a traitor!  You are a traitor, Jeremiah!&rdquo;  And we
can see why they would say that, right?  </p>

<p>Just think, this is your home, this is your city, this is
your nation, this is your king, and here is a man who is declaring publicly in
the gates, &ldquo;The Babylonians are going to win.  The sword is against you.  A
famine will be in this city and you are going into captivity.  This city and
the house of God will be burned!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Just imagine how unpatriotic that sounded, how unpatriotic. 
It is as if America had a war with a nation and somebody started saying, &ldquo;Well,
the other nation is going to win in Iraq.  The Iraqis are going to win.  God is
going to turn America over.&rdquo;  Please, I am just saying that you can imagine how
this sounded.  </p>

<p>Now, God tells us that we are to support our country and I
would never say something like this, that this is the case.  I am just using it
as an example so that we can see how it sounds to our own ears when someone
would say something contrary to their nation, &ldquo;You falleth away to the
Chaldeans.  You are a traitor!  A betrayer!  You are someone who should not
live.&rdquo;  You see, Jeremiah was a true prophet, though, and God was giving him
those words to say.  </p>

<p>Yet, let us go to 1 Kings 22.  We are going to find false
prophets here and true prophets.  Well, prophet, not plural; false prophets,
plural, but one true prophet.  1 Kings 22 is the account of King Ahab who
really was a good king, as far as the people were concerned, the people of Israel. 
But not according to God; he was a wicked man.  Ahab was king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat was king of Judah in the south, and Ahab called for Jehoshaphat and
requested that he go to battle with them.  In 1 Kings 22:3-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
Ramoth in Gilead <i>is </i>ours, and we <i>be </i>still, <i>and </i>take it not
out of the hand of the king of Syria? And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou
go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
I <i>am </i>as thou <i>art, </i>my people as thy people, my horses as thy
horses. And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at
the word JEHOVAH to day. Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets
together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord
shall deliver <i>it </i>into the hand of the king.  </p>

<p>Glory!  Wonderful news, is it not?  Go up!  What
encouragement!  What positive things to say!  It is good news; all the prophets
agree.  With four hundred prophets all on the same page, certainly, they are
speaking the truth!  Certainly, God is with them!  &ldquo;See what we hear?  And not
only that, but this supports our nation, this supports our king, this supports
our plan to do battle, so everything is wonderful!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But Jehoshaphat, I do not know what he is doing there.  God later
questions him about this because he was a true child of God.  Jehoshaphat,
being a true child of God, had an ear to hear, &ldquo;My sheep hear My voice; but the
voice of a stranger, they will not follow.&rdquo;  He had an ear to hear and
everything seemed right, but something inside him sensed, &ldquo;No, this is not quite
right what all of these prophets are saying.&rdquo;  In verse 7, 1 Kings 22:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said, <i>Is there </i>not here a prophet of
JEHOVAH besides, that we might inquire of him?</p>

<p>What was wrong?  What was wrong?  &ldquo;What is wrong with you
people when you are in our church and our church has taught this for hundreds
of years?  Look at everybody, happy and content with what the church teaches,
yet you come in, and you have only been here a year or two, and you do not like
this?  You do not think that our teaching is Biblical?  You do not think that
our doctrines are right?  You know, they are based on the confessions and
creeds.  Everything we teach in this church is according to our fathers and the
traditions that have been handed down for hundreds of years.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is almost as if you feel like a betrayer.  It is almost
as if you are unpatriotic, as far as that church goes.  You are stirring the
pot and you are bringing trouble and that is how God&rsquo;s people have been
throughout the ages of the Church Age. </p>

<p>Of course, we do not have to worry about that today because
the Church Age is over and God has greatly blessed His people in telling us, &ldquo;No,
come on out; come on out; just go to the Bible; be under the hearing of the
Word of God.&rdquo;  While God wanted us to go to the church, we obeyed and we went;
but it is a wonderful blessing to be in unity with God&rsquo;s Word as an individual
and to be in agreement with what the Bible says, and that is all that we have
to worry about.  We do not have to worry about what the church teaches anymore
because the Church Age is over.  </p>

<p>Well, Jehoshaphat, being a child of God, had an ear to
hear.  I cannot stress how much the Bible stresses that this is extremely
important.  In John 8:47:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them

</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>Simple!  Very simple, ultimately.  If you are of God, you
will hear.  If you are not of God, you will not hear.  Hearing involves a lot. 
We are not going to get into that, what exactly that means, but that is what it
comes down to.  Jehoshaphat did not hear the assurance of the spirit within him
assuring him that these words that he was hearing from so many prophets were of
God [<i>note: the speaker inserted an extra &ldquo;not&rdquo; in this sentence, which has
been removed from the written transcript to make things clearer</i>]. <span
style='color:red'> </span>So he says, &ldquo;Is there not another prophet?,&rdquo; and then
in verse 8, 1 Kings 22:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <i>There is </i>yet
one man&hellip;</p>

<p>One individual!  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of JEHOVAH:
but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And
Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>

<p>I love this passage!  I really do.  Every time I read it, it
really reveals so much that is going on in the spiritual realm.  </p>

<p>Here is Ahab and he has everything that he thinks he needs. 
He has an army.  He has a battle plan.  He has full agreement from all of his prophets,
but there is one man, &ldquo;If only that man would go away.  If only that man would
be quiet.  If only that man would not keep telling me things that I hate to
hear!  I hate him because he never says good things.  He is not positive.  He
does not say, &lsquo;God loves you.&rsquo;  He does not say, &lsquo;God has a wonderful plan for
your life.&rsquo;  He does not tell me things that are smooth and flattering to my
ears and things that are easy to receive.  He tells me hard things and
difficult things and things that make me angry.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Ahab is revealing a lot, and he is speaking for a great
number of people in the world when they hear a true prophet.  When they hear a
true prophet, they do not like it.  If they are not of God, they do not like
him and they do not like the message, and yet everyone seems to enjoy hearing
the false prophets.  </p>

<p>By the way, quickly go to Luke 6:26; just one verse, yet a
very important verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
their fathers to the false prophets.  </p>

<p>False prophets!  You know, if you want applause, if you want
adulation, if you want support of people, you can still teach the Bible.  You
can teach the Bible, but you cannot teach it truly, you cannot teach it
rightly, you cannot say it faithfully; because when you do, then you are going
to say things that do not tickle the ears, that are not pleasant, that people
do not want to hear.  Yet Jesus is saying in Luke 6:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you&hellip;  </p>

<p>And this is in the context of prophets.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</p>

<p>That is another characteristic of a false prophet.  He is
not somebody who really is going to offend.  He is not somebody who is going to
say something like, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 is the Rapture.&rdquo;  That is not keeping in
character with a false prophet.  </p>

<p>Now, that is not saying that this means that May 21, 2011 will be the Rapture, but that kind of declaration is not in keeping with what
false prophets proclaim.  They want to say things that people agree with.  They
want to say things that people have no problem in hearing.  </p>

<p>Well, anyway, let us keep reading here.  Ahab said that
there is this one man whom he hates because he prophesies evil.  Then in verse
9, 1 Kings 22:9-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten <i>hither
</i>Micaiah the son of Imlah. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king
of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in
the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before
them. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said,
Thus saith JEHOVAH, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have
consumed them. And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
Ramothgilead, and prosper: for JEHOVAH shall deliver <i>it </i>into the king&rsquo;s
hand. And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying,
Behold now&hellip;</p>

<p>Now, this is the messenger.  This is the messenger that the
king sent.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the words of the prophets <i>declare </i>good unto the king
with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and
speak <i>that which is </i>good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Micaiah.  Come on!  Do not do it again.  Do not do
it again!  Do not ruin the fun.  Do not be the fly in the ointment.  Say what
everybody else is saying!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>1 Kings 22:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, <i>As </i>JEHOVAH liveth, what JEHOVAH saith
unto me, that will I speak.  </p>

<p>Then he does go the king in verse 15.  1 Kings 22:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he
answered him, Go, and prosper: for JEHOVAH shall deliver <i>it </i>into the
hand of the king.  </p>

<p>You know that he said that in such a way that there was no
feeling or heart in it.  He was saying what all the prophets were saying to
make a point, &ldquo;This is what you want to hear, Ahab.  This is what all of you
people want to hear.  Go ahead, go!  Go to your battle.  Prosper!&rdquo;  Then Ahab
knew and we read in verse 16, 1 Kings 22:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee&hellip; 
</p>

<p>So this was, apparently, his mannerism.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;How many times (Micaiah) shall I adjure thee that thou tell me
nothing but <i>that which is </i>true in the name of JEHOVAH?  </p>

<p>So Micaiah does and he tells him, basically, &ldquo;King, if you
go to Ramothgilead, you are going to die.  Do not worry about the battle
because this is your last one; you are going to die.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we are given a glimpse into Heaven a little later in
this chapter, and this is very important for the whole discussion of false
prophets, so let us look at verse 17.  This is Micaiah&rsquo;s prophecy and he said
in 1 Kings 22:17-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep
that have not a shepherd: and JEHOVAH said, These have no master: let them
return every man to his house in peace.  And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me,
but evil? And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of JEHOVAH: I saw JEHOVAH sitting
on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and
on his left. And JEHOVAH said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and
fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that
manner. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before JEHOVAH, and said, I
will persuade him. And JEHOVAH said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he
said, Thou shalt persuade <i>him, </i>and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</p>

<p>Now, that would be Satan who is that spirit who is able to
go into the world.  He stirs up people to prophesy.  Remember, we read in 2
Corinthians 11 that Satan comes as &ldquo;an angel of light&rdquo; and his ministers as &ldquo;ministers
of righteousness.&rdquo;  Speaking of Satan, even that is all lovely and beautiful:
an angel of light and ministers of righteousness.  They speak good things and
they declare things that apparently are from the Bible, and that is why it is
said that they come in &ldquo;sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves.&rdquo;  They come saying such sweet information that people love to hear it and
have it so, yet it leads to their end, it leads to their ruin, it leads to
their destruction.  </p>

<p>Here, God is indicating that it is all His doing behind the
scenes.  He is the One who will give individuals strong delusion that they
should believe a lie.  He is the One who permits Satan to raise up false
teachers and prophets.  </p>

<p>Notice in verse 23, 1 Kings 22:23-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now therefore, behold, JEHOVAH hath put a lying spirit in the
mouth of all these thy prophets, and JEHOVAH hath spoken evil concerning thee. But
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and
said, Which way went the spirit of JEHOVAH from me to speak unto thee?</p>

<p>You know, again, they were identified.  The light shone on
them; the truth shown on them.  Micaiah was saying, &ldquo;They are all false
prophets.&rdquo;  Zedekiah did not like that, so immediately he smote Micaiah.  He
hit him because there is that reaction to prophets.  </p>

<p>Micaiah was taken to prison.  Jeremiah spent many days in
prison.  God&rsquo;s people have suffered in many ways as a result of prophesying
truly and earnestly as to what the Bible says.  </p>

<p>There are so many examples that I think we are going have to
maybe do a second study on this just so we can cover some of the ground that
the Bible does.  But to close, let us go to Jeremiah 26.  Here in verse 6,
Jeremiah again is bringing the Word of God that is very unpopular.  It is not
well received by the people of Jerusalem, and he says in Jeremiah 26:6-7 where
God is speaking through Jeremiah:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city
a curse to all the nations of the earth. So the priests and the prophets and
all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of JEHOVAH.</p>

<p>And, again, they say, &ldquo;He is worthy to die, so put him to
death.&rdquo;  But there were some princes, a handful of princes who spared Jeremiah
at this time.  In verse 16, it goes on, Jeremiah 26:16-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
the prophets; This man <i>is </i>not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in
the name of JEHOVAH our God. Then rose up certain of the elders of the land,
and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying, Micah the Morasthite
prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people
of Judah, saying, Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; Zion shall be plowed <i>like </i>a
field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the
high places of a forest. Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at
all to death? did he not fear JEHOVAH, and besought JEHOVAH, and JEHOVAH
repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we
procure great evil against our souls.  </p>

<p>So we see Micah from the book of Micah that we find in Old
Testament Scriptures who likewise prophesied in a similar manner as Jeremiah
and as Micaiah about Amos.  Remember Amos, when he prophesied in Israel against
the king that God was going to remove them out of the land?  There was a priest
of Bethel, which means &ldquo;the house of God&rdquo;, who wrote to the king and he
complained about Amos.  </p>

<p>I know that I said that would be the last verse, but let us
go to Amos 7:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel:
the land is not able to bear all his words. For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall
die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own
land. Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land
 of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: But prophesy not again any
more at Bethel (the house of God): for it <i>is </i>the king&rsquo;s chapel, and it <i>is
</i>the king&rsquo;s court.  </p>

<p>It is the same story, the same story, &ldquo;Go away!  Go away! 
Far away!  Go to Judah.  Go away, because we do not want to hear these words.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>This is going to be the last passage.  In Jeremiah 28, there
was a man who came who was speaking contrary to the word of Jeremiah, which was
that God would judge Babylon and that He would send the Jews into captivity. 
This man named Hananiah did give a time reference of two years and the King of
Babylon&rsquo;s threat would be taken away.  It says in Jeremiah 28:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into
Babylon, saith JEHOVAH: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.  </p>

<p>Sounds good!  Sounds good and Jeremiah agrees in verse 6,
Jeremiah 28:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: JEHOVAH do so: JEHOVAH
perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this
place. </p>

<p>Very similar to Micaiah who was mouthing the words of the
false prophets, &ldquo;Go up and prosper.&rdquo;  Jeremiah agrees with the prophecy, &ldquo;Amen:
may the Lord do so.&rdquo;  Jeremiah is saying, &ldquo;I would have no difficulty desiring this
myself and accepting this.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If only the Church Age was not over; if only God&rsquo;s judgment
was not upon the house of God; if only the Lord was still working in the
churches as He had done throughout the Church Age; however, He is not.  He is
not, and so it says in verse 7, Jeremiah 28:7-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,
and in the ears of all the people; The prophets that have been before me and
before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great
kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet which prophesieth
of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, <i>then </i>shall
the prophet be known, that JEHOVAH hath truly sent him.  </p>

<p>Do you see the character of a true prophet?  Judgment! 
War!  Evil!  Pestilence!  And the character of the false prophet, repeatedly:
not so!  &ldquo;Not so!  No, the Lord will fight for us.  This is Jerusalem.&rdquo;  Or as
people are saying today, &ldquo;This is the church!  God&rsquo;s judgment is not on the
church.  It is His church.&rdquo;  Well, so was Israel His people and He judged
them.  </p>

<p>So, now, you see, we say, because the Bible teaches it, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 is the Rapture.  October 21, 2011, with five months of torment in between,
will be the end of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Is that a false prophecy?  Is that being a false prophet? 
No, no believer who is saying this is saying that it is because of a dream or a
vision or a tongue.  It is not coming from any supernatural source.  It is not
coming from any source but the Bible alone.  Judgment!  Evil!  Pestilence! 
Like Jonah, &ldquo;Yet forty day, Nineveh, and you will be overthrown!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Time and judgment, the voice of a true prophet.  That is how
they come.  And when somebody says, &ldquo;Not so; no way; uh-uh; there will not be
any Rapture; I will see you on May 22, 2011,&rdquo; well, they just prophesied.  They
just prophesied and God has said to many false prophets in His Word, &ldquo;They speak
a lie in My Name; I did not send them.&rdquo;  They are prophesying of peace.  They
are saying, &ldquo;The world is going to continue.  Yes, the world is full of
wickedness that it has never seen before, such ugliness is going on in the
world that, yes, we would have to admit that it is ripe for judgment.  But,
nonetheless, the world is going to continue.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Alright.  Well, that is your prophecy.  God&rsquo;s prophecy is
coming from His Word and we will see which prophecy will stand.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
