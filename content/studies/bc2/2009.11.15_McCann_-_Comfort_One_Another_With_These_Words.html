<p>If everyone could please turn to 1 Thessalonians 5, I will
start reading from verse 1.  1 Thessalonians 5:1-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then
sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and
they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day
should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the
children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us
not sleep, as <i>do </i>others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that
sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith
and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed
us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,  </p>

<p>I will stop there.  </p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 5 is another one of those passages that
people go to to prove&mdash;they think&mdash;that no man will be able to know the time of Christ&rsquo;s
return or the end of the world.  There are several verses in the Bible that God
has placed there for a particular reason.  There can be several reasons, but
one of them is to discourage people from looking into the Bible&rsquo;s information concerning
the end of the world, especially the timing of the end of the world.  The Bible
says here and maybe a place or two elsewhere:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>A thief does not call ahead of time and inform the house
owner, &ldquo;I will be by about 3:00 A.M. to break into your house.&rdquo;  A thief does
not do this; and so people say, &ldquo;Well, you see, Christ is coming as a thief and
this means that you cannot know.  You just cannot know when the time will be
that Jesus returns.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Pretty much everywhere and in all of the denominations in
all of the churches, the church acknowledges that there will be an end, that
the Bible does say that this world will have a conclusion, that time one day
will stop, that everything going on in this world will come to an end.  </p>

<p>This is because we cannot deny this.  The Bible shows us in
many places that since the fall into sin the world itself has been under the
judgment of God and the wrath of God and is subject to destruction, just like
mankind who has rebelled against God is subject to an eternal destruction.  </p>

<p>So people cannot deny this.  They cannot deny this and yet
they do not want to think that the end is going to come now in our generation
and during our lifetime.  After all, the world has been going on almost 2,000
years since Christ went to the cross, so why now?  The world has existed for
thousands of years, so why now at this time would God want to destroy the
world?  </p>

<p>I think that the Bible shows that underneath much of the
criticism of date setting or putting forth a time when Jesus will return is the
idea that many in the churches do not really want the world to end.  Many
professing Christians are not looking forward to Christ&rsquo;s return.  They are not
happy or excited about it or comforted by it.  </p>

<p>Look back in 1 Thessalonians 4, the previous chapter.  I am
going to read a few verses here.  Notice how the return of Christ and the
rapture and judgment day is looked at by God Himself and how God is stating
these things.  He is doing so not to bring fear to people but to actually
encourage them.  In 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep
in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive <i>and </i>remain unto the coming of the Lord
shall not prevent [or <i>precede</i>] them which are asleep. For the Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
Then we which are alive <i>and </i>remain shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  </p>

<p>It does not say, &ldquo;Make them fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cause people to be
anxious and troubled of mind and distressed,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Comfort one another.&rdquo;  This
is because this is a comfort to the child of God.  It is a great comfort to
think, &ldquo;May 21 in 2011 is it.  That is it!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because the child of God may have been struggling,
even though the believer is joyous and content.  He does delight in the Word of
God and there are many blessings for God&rsquo;s people here in this world at this
time, but the Bible speaks of this only being a part of our salvation.  We have
&ldquo;the earnest of the Spirit&rdquo; or a down payment on what is to come.  </p>

<p>This is like when you put a down payment on a house.  It is
guaranteed because you have bought it.  You left that money on it and so it is
going to be your house, but you just cannot wait until you get the whole house
and you do not owe a dime.  Is this not how it is?  </p>

<p>This is what God is saying.  This down payment is our
inheritance.  This is what He has given to the heirs of Christ, which is
salvation, an eternal life in a new heaven and a new earth without all the sins
and troubles that sin brings along with it.  It is a &ldquo;great reward&rdquo; that God
gives each and every one of His elect people.  So, of course, the child of God
is excited.  They just cannot wait for God to fulfill His Word and His promises
and to see this all come to pass.  </p>

<p>Along with this, there is sorrow and some sadness for our
families, for our neighbors, our friends, our co-workers, and even the person whom
we do not know, the stranger on the street.  This is because we understand that
for these things to come to pass, the Lord is going to have to destroy this world
and all of the unsaved people of the world along with it.  </p>

<p>However, overall and for the most part, the believer looks
excitedly towards this and is thinking, &ldquo;Wow!  Finally!  Finally!  No more
affliction.  No more sin and all of the trouble that comes with it,&rdquo; and on and
on and on.  </p>

<p>This is a great comfort, but maybe not for every professing Christian. 
Actually, this is definitely not, because many who profess to be Christians are
not really Christians.  </p>

<p>However, this is a great comfort to the wife who is in a
home with a brute of a husband who is not saved and who gets drunk and beats her
and speaks badly of her.  Yet God has saved her, and so she keeps seeking
refuge again and again in the Bible and going to her prayer closet and praying,
&ldquo;Oh Lord, help me to get through this day.  Strengthen me.  Help me to love my
husband even though he does these things to me.&rdquo;  This is very comforting to
her.  It is very comforting to know that 18 or so months and then this is all
over.  </p>

<p>This is also a comfort for the prisoner who is deservedly in
prison who has a 20-year sentence or a life sentence, which is such a weight
and a burden on him.  He realizes these things because he heard the Gospel
while he was in prison and God saved him.  He realizes that he is getting his
just desserts, &ldquo;This is the punishment for the crime that I did,&rdquo; but he is now
living with that righteous soul that God has given him and it is being vexed
day-by-day.  We can just imagine what goes on in prison with all of the other
prisoners who do not care anything about the Gospel or the Bible.  To him or to
her, to this person, their response would be, &ldquo;Wow!  This is it!  This is it! 
I cannot wait!  How much easier this makes the time from now until then to
serve my sentence!&rdquo;  This is a great comfort, a tremendous comfort.  </p>

<p>We could think of a thousand different circumstances.  For
example, the Muslim who hears the Gospel and God converts him into a child of
God.  However, he is in a Muslim land and in a Muslim home where there is tremendous
persecution.  On and on and on, this is a great comfort for God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>This is what God means because one of the purposes in
revealing this information is to bring comfort to those who are in great
tribulation, to those who are at the very end of the world; and yet through His
Word, God has opened up this information.  </p>

<p>This is as comforting as when Joseph went to his brothers
and revealed himself.  He told them, &ldquo;The famine has been two years and it is
going to be five more years.  In the meantime, I am going to feed and nourish
you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you see how God has established things for His people? 
It is nothing but a blessing that we specifically know the time when the great
tribulation ends and God&rsquo;s judgment begins.  This is a blessing for everyone
else, too, even if people do not want to see this as a blessing.  It is a
blessing to be forewarned, to be given advance notice, even if someone is not a
child of God.  </p>

<p>Look at Hebrews 11:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
</p>

<p>Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau who were twin brothers.  One
was God&rsquo;s elect and the other was not; so God said, &ldquo;Jacob have I loved, but
Esau have I hated.&rdquo;  But Isaac is an earthly father and he loves both of his
children.  Even though God made a choice and a distinction and He saved one and
not the other, Isaac was still hoping and praying for his son Esau; and so he
gives them both all of the information that he knows, information that God has
given to him &ldquo;concerning things to come.&rdquo;  And it says that he blessed them
with this information, even though one was unsaved.  </p>

<p>We do not know who the sheep are or who the goats are,
except we do know that those who are remaining in the churches are giving
evidence that they may not be the wheat.  They are instead giving an appearance
of being a tare.  They are not obeying God or the Bible.  They are staying put
in a place where God has commanded them to come out of.  </p>

<p>We know this, but still there is hope.  This is because it
is still the day of salvation.  May 21 has not gotten here yet; therefore, it
is possible that anyone in a church, from the Pope to a Bishop to a minister to
an elder or a deacon or a congregational member sitting in a pew, any one of
them potentially could be saved if it were God&rsquo;s will to draw them out of the
church.  </p>

<p>We do not know who is going to be saved or not saved and so
we share with everyone, &ldquo;Here is the news.  This is what we have learned from
the Bible.&rdquo;  For some people, this is the worst news possible, &ldquo;My life is
going to be interrupted.  My life!  I have not even done hardly any of the
things that I wanted to do.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, to tell you the truth, in all probability you could go
through your whole life and not accomplish many of the things that you actually
wanted to accomplish or do the things that you actually wanted to do.  This is
the experience of most people.  </p>

<p>You see, God is not going to prolong this earth and keep
this world operating for any individual or group of individuals so that they
can accomplish their desires for an education or a career or a family or for
the opportunity to possess things.  God is not going to continue this world for
one moment in order for someone to satisfy what in all probability is more of a
lust than a desire or a legitimate want in many cases.  It is just things that
man wants as he has entered into rebellion against God, and God is not going to
continue it.  The only reason that this world has continued and why the Lord
has been longsuffering is because of salvation.  </p>

<p>2 Peter 3:15 tells us this.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And account <i>that </i>the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is </i>salvation&hellip; 
</p>

<p>He is longsuffering because He is waiting for &ldquo;the early and
latter rain&rdquo; in order to bring forth &ldquo;the precious fruit.&rdquo; &ldquo;And account&rdquo; means
that this is how we can understand the longsuffering of our God.  It is for one
purpose only, which is salvation.  When He finishes His salvation plan, there
will be no more longsuffering.  &ldquo;Immediately he putteth in the sickle&rdquo; once the
fruit is ready, and then we have judgment day.  </p>

<p>We know that this day is coming.  What this means is that
this great multitude whom God intends to save will have been saved by May 21 in
2011.  There is then no purpose any longer for allowing the world to continue
on.  </p>

<p>This will interrupt everything, all the plans of man. 
Vacations for the summer?  This is going to be in May in 2011.  It will be in
the spring.  Do not make arrangements for Ocean City.  Do not bother to make
any kind of arrangements for Florida during that summer.  Those are short-term
plans and people also have long-term plans like retirement, retiring at 62 or
65 or 70 and putting everything away for a day that they are never even going
to get close to coming to.  </p>

<p>It would be much wiser to take a look at your life and your
plans and factor in that you have seen the Great Physician.  Just like a doctor
tells a patient that they have so long to live, God the Great Physician has
given us the truth that we have from now until then to live out our lives and
to continue to live in this world.  Every day is very important because we know
that our days are numbered and are fast elapsing.  Just like sand in an
hourglass, it is running out.  There are a few grains left and then that is
it.  There will be no more time.  As it says in Revelation, &ldquo;there should be
time no longer.&rdquo;  There is no more time.  </p>

<p>Of course for the believer, we are aware of this.  This really
is leading us to pray that the Lord would help us to redeem the time, to use
our resources and our time and our lives more for what God would have us to
do.  </p>

<p>I wanted to read 1 Thessalonians 4 because we see that
leading into chapter 5, it is a discussion on the rapture and of the
resurrection of God&rsquo;s people.  Then in 1 Thessalonians 5:1-2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>This speaks of &ldquo;the times and the seasons.&rdquo;  Again, God is
establishing the same context from the previous chapter.  </p>

<p>I wanted to point this out because some people say that in
the later verses where it is speaking of people who are in the dark, this is
referring to Christ coming as a thief for them.  For the people who are in the
light, they say that Christ is not coming as a thief for them.  Some people are
trying to say that this is only concerning salvation.  If you are saved, then
you are in the light; if you are not saved, then you are in the dark&mdash;and that
is it.  </p>

<p>They are trying to indicate that this has nothing to do with
knowing the time or the day of judgment, which goes contrary to the whole
context set in the previous chapter of the rapture and the resurrection and
what is established in the first couple of verses of 1 Thessalonians 5, which
refers to &ldquo;the times and the seasons&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course this has to do with understanding &ldquo;time and
judgment,&rdquo; understanding when it will take place, and God&rsquo;s people will
understand this.  They are in the light and they can see.  Failing to
understand or to recognize that God has appointed a day in which to judge the
world and that He has made this day known means that certain people are in
darkness.  It is those whom the thief comes for, for those who are in
darkness.  </p>

<p>We can carry this further to mean, of course, that those who
are in the light are those who are saved and that those who are in darkness are
those who are not saved, but this is not the main point that God is trying to
make.  He is saying that His people will understand.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Acts 1 and look at a couple of verses dealing
with the question of times and seasons.  It says in Acts 1:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
the seasons&hellip;  </p>

<p>So people say, &ldquo;See?  You keep bringing up this date!  It is
not for you to know!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is just like what we read in Matthew 24:36, which
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>So they say, &ldquo;Why are you so stubborn?&rdquo;  We are stubborn
because we have to read the whole Bible.  We have to read everything that God
says about times and seasons and about knowing or not being able to know when
He is coming.  </p>

<p>In Acts 1:7, it is important to know that the word &ldquo;you&rdquo; is
in the genitive case and it means &ldquo;of you.&rdquo;  Again, Acts 1:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, It is not [<i>of</i>] you to know the
times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  </p>

<p>God knows, right?  Does not God know when He is going to destroy
the world?  Definitely!  He knows.  He knows.  It is in His power.  It is under
His authority and control, and He did not reveal this.  For centuries, He did
not disclose this even to His people.  This is because He tells us in Daniel, &ldquo;seal
the book, <i>even </i>to the time of the end.&rdquo;  It was not for His people to
know during the church age when this time would come.  It was in the Father&rsquo;s
power and under His control.  If He were pleased to do so, He could have revealed
this information to His people.  </p>

<p>This is just as we read in 1 Corinthians 2:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
God.  </p>

<p>You and I do not know a thing about the Bible, about
spiritual things, the things of God.  We do not have any idea.  If left to
ourselves, if man is left to his natural mind when he looks at the Word of God,
what will he do?  Well, he will have a gospel, but it will be a false gospel. 
He will have doctrines, but they will be false doctrines.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what we see in the churches today because
they are left to themselves.  It is the natural mind that is coming to the
Bible and trying to understand an infinite mind who gave us this Word, the
Bible.  Therefore, they do not know the things of God.  </p>

<p>But look at 1 Corinthians 2:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God.  </p>

<p>The Lord gives us His Spirit and we begin to understand
Scripture.  We begin to see and to know what the Bible is teaching on this
point or on that point.  It was in God&rsquo;s control and then He imparted this knowledge. 
He gave us eyes to see and ears to hear.  He shed the light on His Word, which
enabled His people to finally understand it.  Anyone who does not receive God&rsquo;s
Spirit cannot understand.  This is an impossibility, because they are still in
the dark.  </p>

<p>Have you ever picked up a book at midnight when there were no lights on at all?  Maybe if you had really good eyesight and you stared
and you stared, you would be able to make out a couple of words, but try
reading a lot at that time.  Most people would not be able to see very well in
the dark.  They would not be able to read 1 Thessalonians in the dark at midnight and be able to tell someone what it meant.  Read Matthew or Luke or Revelation or
Ezekiel or Daniel in the dark.  What will you be able to tell me about those
books?  You will not be able to tell me very much because you needed to have
the light on in order to see what God had written.  </p>

<p>This is just physically a good analogy of how things are
spiritually.  Christ is the light of the world.  If He enters into us, then we
have light and He guides us.  The Holy Spirit leads us step-by-step along the
path of life, the narrow way.  He will lead us into a proper understanding of
the Word of God.  However, if we do not have the Holy Spirit, then we are in
darkness.  </p>

<p>This is the whole idea in Matthew 25 with the ten virgins
who have lamps that are without oil.  God&rsquo;s people, the wise virgins, have oil
in their lamps, and so they can light their lamps and see.  The foolish virgins
do not have any oil, they cannot light their lamps, and they cannot see.  This
led to them being locked out when the bridegroom came.  They could not enter in. 
They were not part of the Bride of Christ.  </p>

<p>I want to look at one more thing in Acts.  Acts 1:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own <span class="underline">power</span>.</p>

<p>Then Acts 1:8 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye shall receive <span class="underline">power</span>, after that the Holy Ghost is
come upon you&hellip;   </p>

<p>Again, this is the same idea.  It is a different Greek word
for &ldquo;power,&rdquo; but it is giving us the same idea.  It is in God&rsquo;s hands when a
person becomes saved.  They will have some understanding during the church age;
but now at the end, God is opening up all things that He wants His people to
know concerning &ldquo;time and judgment&rdquo; and other things.  This is just simply a
matter of Jesus opening up the understanding of a person.  </p>

<p>Back to 1 Thessalonians 5:1, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you.  </p>

<p>If you look at 1 Thessalonians 4:9, this is a similar
verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.  </p>

<p>So this has the same idea.  1 Thessalonians 5:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye have no need that I write unto you.</p>

<p>And 1 Thessalonians 4:9 said:</p>

<p class="verse"> &hellip;touching [or <i>concerning</i>] brotherly love&hellip;</p>

<p>This is because it is obvious that the Bible teaches that we
are to love one another.  We are to have &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo;  The Apostle Paul
who is writing under the inspiration of God is saying that there is no need for
him to make this statement because it is obvious elsewhere in the Bible, many
places in the Bible, that we are to love one another.  </p>

<p>This is the same idea concerning &ldquo;time and judgment.&rdquo;  It is
telling us that this is already in the Bible.  It is in the Bible.  He is
saying, &ldquo;I do not really need to address this because the information
concerning times and seasons is contained in the Word of God, the Bible.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>And this is where we found this information.  No one
received a dream.  Someone may have received a dream, but no true believer
received a dream with May 21, 2011 circled in red on a calendar indicating that
this is why this date is so important and that this is why it is judgment day. 
</p>

<p>No, that was not why or how we came to this date.  It was
through the Bible.  It was through studying the Bible.  That is how all of this
information was derived and we can now present this to people and tell them that
this verse compared with that verse was how we were able to come to learn this
and to know this.  </p>

<p>This is one big reason why people should at least give this
a fair hearing.  They should at least say, &ldquo;Okay, I am going to get the book <i>We
Are Almost There!</i> or <i>Time Has an End</i>, or I am going to listen to the
&lsquo;Open Forum&rsquo; and the Bible studies.  I am going to check this out to see if
this is so.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the bare minimum that a person ought to do because
this is coming from the right source.  This is not coming from additional
revelation.  This is not based on a tongue or a dream or a voice from Heaven. 
This is all from the Bible, which is the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Of course God possesses the knowledge of when the end will
be.  It is not beyond Him to put this information in the Bible where it could lie
dormant for a period of time and then open it up at the proper time according
to His overall plan.  Yet people make it sound like this is way beyond God.  </p>

<p>The infinite God who inhabits eternity, who spoke and brought
this world and universe into being, I think can handle giving His prophets of
old information that they themselves did not understand, and then store it up
like grain, just as Joseph did until the right time, and then open up the
storehouse to give it to His people.  </p>

<p>Is this beyond God?  Someone has a low opinion of the power
of God and His ability if they think that He could not do something like this,
especially when He tells us in the Bible that this is what He did.  In the book
of Daniel, He said, &ldquo;O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even </i>to
the time of the end.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, God was just using Daniel.  Daniel did not have
the power to seal up the Bible, but God did.  He wrapped it in seven seals,
spiritually speaking, and those seals would not come off until the time of the
end, until our time, this day.  And we were not the ones who could take them
off even then.  God had to take them off.  He unsealed the Book.  He is the One
who is giving us this information that is so exact to where we know the year,
the month, and the day of the end of the world, just like Noah knew the year,
the month, and the day of the flood.  This is all in God&rsquo;s hands and He has
worked this out according to His perfect will.   </p>

<p>Then 1 Thessalonians 5:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>So many Christians insist that Christ is coming as a thief. 
They say, &ldquo;I do not want to read your tract.  I do not want to check it out.  I
read the Bible and the Bible says that He is coming as a thief and that no man
can know&mdash;period!&rdquo;  This is what they have to say and then they just cut if off
right there.  </p>

<p>The tragic thing is that He is coming as a thief.  If that
person who makes this kind of statement continues with this mindset, Christ
will come as a thief for that person.  He will come at a time unexpected, at an
hour unaware, and he will catch them by surprise, suddenly.  At that point,
they will realize the truth.  They will realize that they heard this and that
they dismissed it.  </p>

<p>How does a thief come?  We mentioned that he comes late at
night, in the dark.  But does a thief come to give gifts?  Does a thief come to
give good things to people?  Does a thief come to bless in any way?  </p>

<p>This is the mindset that people have, &ldquo;Christ is coming as a
thief and then He is going to give me my eternal reward.  When He comes as a
thief, He is going to lift me up into Heaven and I will have eternal life
forevermore.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But is <span class="underline">this</span> what a thief does?  What does a thief do
when he comes?  A thief kills and destroys.  </p>

<p>Let us go to John 10.  The Bible tells us that Jesus is
coming as a thief.  This is a fact.  But in John 10, the Lord gives us a little
bit better understanding of what a thief does when he comes.  In John 10:9, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">I am the door&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is Christ and this door is shut on May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in
and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill,
and to destroy:  </p>

<p>Then Jesus goes on to speak about His first coming:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i>it
</i>more abundantly.  </p>

<p>But a thief comes to do terrible things.  A thief comes &ldquo;to
kill, and to destroy,&rdquo; suddenly.  </p>

<p>This is what 1 Thessalonians 5:3 is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
shall not escape.  </p>

<p>This is the day of the Lord and this is when He comes as a
thief in the night.  However, the thief is bringing &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo; and &ldquo;they
shall not escape.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Where is the idea that the thief is coming to take His
people into Heaven to give them such great eternal blessings and rewards?  </p>

<p>We read in 1 Thessalonians 5:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people are not going to be caught off-guard like a
thief.  Jesus will not come &ldquo;as a thief&rdquo; for them because they have been
watching in the Bible.  They have been keeping watch in the Scriptures.  They
have been studying the Word of God.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people have done this throughout the generations.  But
now, following the same mandate that Jesus gave in the first century A.D., God&rsquo;s
people read the Bible and they now understand and see when the thief is coming. 
We know that Christ is coming for judgment on May 21.  </p>

<p>Therefore, since we have this information, the Lord says in
1 Thessalonians 5:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.  </p>

<p>We can see why some people are in big trouble with God, huge
trouble.  It is because they are being ignorant of what God is doing.  They are
not only being ignorant but they are even being hostile towards it and personally
insisting, &ldquo;You cannot know; no man can know; Christ is coming as a thief,&rdquo;
when God says, &ldquo;Yes, but only for those who are in darkness.  For those, I come
to destroy and I come to kill.  For those, I am coming as a thief, but not for
My people.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Here is where all of the other verses in the Bible come in. 
For example, it says in Amos 3:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely the Lord JEHOVAH will do nothing, but he revealeth his
secret unto his servants the prophets.  </p>

<p>He is going to tell them.  </p>

<p>We are hearing a great deal about the book of Ecclesiastes
today.  In Ecclesiastes 8:5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.  </p>

<p>The wise virgins have the oil in their lamps.  They can
see.  They can discern.  They can understand.  The wise will know.  </p>

<p>We read in Daniel 12:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are </i>closed
up and sealed till the time of the end.  </p>

<p>Verse 10 is speaking of the end.  Daniel 12:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise
shall understand.  </p>

<p>Light/darkness, oil/no oil: the wise understand but the
wicked do not understand.  They cannot because they are trying to read a Book,
the most complicated Book in all of the world, in the dark!  </p>

<p>Try reading a medical journal in the dark or a law book in
the dark.  The Bible is far more complicated than anything like that because
this is the mind of God, and yet people are trying to look at it while they are
still in darkness.  This is why they are going to come up with a great many
wrong ideas and thoughts.  </p>

<p>Proverbs 28:5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Evil [or <i>wicked</i>] men understand not judgment: but they
that seek JEHOVAH understand all.</p>

<p>Again we see a contrast, one against the other.  God takes
care of His people.  He reveals these things to His people.  Not so for evil
men.  Who is evil?  Terrorists are evil and murderers are evil, but so is every
human being.  The moment that we break the Law of God, that is evil and we
become evil.  </p>

<p>So this is referring to evil men who are still in their sins
because they have not found a Saviour.  God has not saved them and so they &ldquo;understand
not judgment.&rdquo;  They do not have this ability to discern &ldquo;time and judgment&rdquo; as
God&rsquo;s people do.  </p>

<p>Regarding false teachers or the unsaved in the churches, it
says in 2 Peter 2:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here is the explanation for all of the mockers and the
revilers and all of those who are so quick to put down the idea that anyone can
know the end of the world.  They do not understand because they are in
spiritual darkness.  Because they do not understand, they &ldquo;speak evil of the
things that they understand not.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what God tells us.  He is the One who knows what is
going on in the hearts of men and He can see things very clearly that we cannot
see.  This explains all of the mockery and the easy things that people like to
say.  </p>

<p>It is amazing how people are able to put down information
that they have not checked out themselves.  They have not looked at this, and yet
this same person can be very respectful of a doctor because the doctor knows
medicine.  The doctor knows the subject of medicine.  He went to college and he
went to medical school and he is respected because of all of his learning, and
there are many other occupations and professions that people have where they
have had to do a great deal of study and learning.  </p>

<p>However, we have a person like Mr. Camping who has studied
for fifty plus years in the Bible and only the Bible, just the Bible and
nothing else.  Then we have someone who goes to church after a couple of
Sundays and hears his pastor say, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour,&rdquo; and he does
not even bother to check this out himself.  This man will say, &ldquo;You cannot
know.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, how much study have they put into the Bible?  How much
diligence have they put into studying the Scriptures and checking the Greek and
the Hebrew and making sure that all of their conclusions harmonize?  How many
years?  Even pastors, how many years have they done this?  Rather than
comparing Scripture with Scripture, pastors compare Calvin with Luther.  </p>

<p>I remember having a pastor who was a very well-respected
pastor in the Philadelphia area.  He was really lifted up as a knowledgeable
man of the Word of God.  Yet without fail, for every sermon on whatever verse
that he was on, he would spend 10-15 minutes presenting the position of a saint
of old, someone from the past who in all likelihood was saved, someone who
presented himself to be a faithful child of God.  Then he would give a contrary
position for another 10-15 minutes.  Then he would conclude by saying, &ldquo;Now
here is what I think.&rdquo;  This would be the essence of his study.  This was to be
the Gospel, the Word of God that was being taught to the people.  </p>

<p>How much study do pastors actually and honestly put into the
Bible itself without going to commentaries and other theological books?  I
think that it is very little, very little.  Yet they are quick to say, &ldquo;No man
knows.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, anyone can say this because this is a superficial
understanding of what the verse is saying.  They are not checking out this
statement against everything else in the Bible.  </p>

<p>Going back to 1 Thessalonians 5, I was hoping to get into a
lot of these words.  Once again, we read in 1 Thessalonians 5:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
as a thief in the night.  </p>

<p>Let us look at one last verse concerning this in Revelation
3:3, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  </p>

<p>This is conditional.  He comes as a thief if you do not watch,
but Jesus said, &ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;  We do not watch on our roof.  That is not where we
look for the return of Christ.  We do not look there.  That is not where we
watch.  We watch in the Bible.  We are told to &ldquo;watch therefore.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So you keep studying, you keep checking it out, because God
says that if you do not do this, if you fail to do this, if you accept the conclusion
that the Reformers gave 400 years ago that you are not to understand &ldquo;time and
judgment,&rdquo; that God has forbidden this and that you just cannot look into these
things, if you have done this, then you are not watching.  You are not doing
what Christ would have you to do.  Or if you are listening to your
denomination, your church, your pastor, etc., you are not watching, because it
is only in the Bible that you are to watch.  </p>

<p>Again, Revelation 3:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
thief&hellip;  </p>

<p>The implication is what happens if you do watch?  The
implication is that if you do watch, then He will <span class="underline">not</span> come on you as a
thief.  </p>

<p>Because the Lord has given us so much precise information at
this time, I do not think it but I know that He has forewarned His people of things
that He is about to do.   However, many are going to be caught unaware on that
day.  </p>

<p>How can they be caught unaware when they heard, when they
knew that this was being proclaimed for so many years?  How can the Bible say
that it will be a &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo;?  How can God say this?  </p>

<p>Go back to Proverbs 29.  I just want to look at one verse
there.  We read in Proverbs 29:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.  </p>

<p>Do you see what I see in this verse?  What is the problem
with this verse?  </p>

<p>Concerning being suddenly destroyed, we read about this in 1
Thessalonians 5.  Those who are not watching are saying that Christ is coming
as a thief and they are going to be facing &ldquo;sudden destruction.&rdquo;  Proverbs 29
is telling us the same thing, using the same words against those who are &ldquo;often
reproved.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So instead of taking reproof and correction, they continue
on in their sin.  They continue on doing what God is displeased with.  As a
result, they will be suddenly destroyed.  </p>

<p>But if you are &ldquo;often reproved,&rdquo; how can it be &ldquo;sudden
destruction&rdquo;?  Did God not warn and warn and warn?  Is this not what He is
telling us when He is saying that we are &ldquo;often reproved&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>2 Timothy 3:16 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">All scripture <i>is </i>given by inspiration of God, and <i>is </i>profitable
for doctrine, for <span class="underline">reproof</span>, for correction&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Word of God itself is the reproof that reproves us
individually.  We know when we are involved with sin because the Bible convicts
us, does it not?  It reproves us.  We know that it is wrong.  Yet, as John was
saying earlier, some people have a very difficult time and they continue on in
the same sin, and the same Word of God that reproved us the first time that we
did it is reproving us the 100<sup>th</sup> time or the 1000<sup>th</sup> time,
and we are oft reproved.  </p>

<p>The Bible is very serious when it tells us to repent and to
turn from our sins.  Yet God is gracious, God is longsuffering, and He is
patient.  He asks us in one place, &ldquo;Knoweth not the goodness of God leadeth
thee to repentance?&rdquo;  This is one of the things that the Word is accomplishing
in the lives of the elect, but not in everyone else.  </p>

<p>But, you see, God keeps on reproving.  Do we know this?  Yes. 
Yes, we know this.  We can understand what He is doing.  But there comes a time
in an individual&rsquo;s life when on a particular morning they did that same sin,
whatever it was, and then that night they died.  The Lord came and took away
their soul.  </p>

<p>They had been &ldquo;often reproved,&rdquo; again and again and again,
and yet they remained in sin until death, which ended it.  There is no more
mercy, no more days of salvation for any person who dies, no more sending forth
the Gospel into that individual&rsquo;s life.  It is done.  </p>

<p>God has judged people in this way all throughout history.  He
has also said the same thing about Israel in 2 Kings 17.  In 2 Kings 17, I
wanted to read this whole passage, but I do not think that I will have the
time.  We read in 2 Kings 17:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yet JEHOVAH testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all
the prophets, <i>and by </i>all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways,
and keep my commandments <i>and </i>my statutes, according to all the law which
I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. Notwithstanding
they would not hear, but hardened their necks&hellip;  </p>

<p>This statement is also in Proverbs 29:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here, God is addressing the nation of Israel in the north. 
They rejected His statutes, as we read in 2 Kings 17:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in JEHOVAH their God.
And they rejected his statutes&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Bible.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his
testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and
became vain, and went after the heathen that <i>were </i>round about them&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then we read in 2 Kings 17:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they left all the commandments of JEHOVAH their God, and
made them molten images, <i>even </i>two calves, and made a grove, and
worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.  </p>

<p>Then 2 Kings 17:18 is where we read of the result:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore JEHOVAH was very angry with Israel, and removed them
out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.  </p>

<p>He sent His prophets repeatedly to warn them again and again
with the Word of God.  Then finally God judged them.  He took them away.  </p>

<p>We just read of Israel.  2 Chronicles 36 tells us about Judah. 
We read in 2 Chronicles 36:14-16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted
the house of JEHOVAH which he had hallowed in Jerusalem. And JEHOVAH God of
their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending;
because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place: But they
mocked the messengers of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>This would be representative of the believer bringing the
Gospel into the world.  </p>

<p class="verse">But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
and misused his prophets, until the wrath of JEHOVAH arose against his people,
till <i>there was </i>no remedy.  </p>

<p>This is also in Proverbs 29:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.  </p>

<p>There is no remedy.  The word &ldquo;remedy&rdquo; means &ldquo;healing&rdquo; or &ldquo;curing.&rdquo; 
It has to do with what it sounds like, with medicine, medicine that is able to
help heal a person.  Jesus, the Great Physician, has that balm of Gilead that
He can apply to the sin-sick soul to heal, to save, and to wash away all the
sins of that individual.  </p>

<p>But there comes a point when there is no more remedy, as we
read, &ldquo;<i>Is there </i>no balm in Gilead?&rdquo;  No, there is no more balm in the
churches and congregations.  There is no balm in Israel of old or in Judah of
old.  </p>

<p>God saw their sin and put up with their sin for a long time
really, as far as we are concerned and from our perspective.  Then He suddenly
destroyed them and they were caught off-guard.  </p>

<p>How could Israel have been suddenly destroyed?  How could Judah
have been suddenly destroyed?  Jeremiah kept telling them again and again and
again what God was about to do in bringing the Babylonians against them, and
yet they were suddenly destroyed.  </p>

<p>One last passage that I would like to look at is in Matthew
24.  Matthew 24 is the account that gives us some information about the flood. 
I will begin reading in Matthew 24:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man, </i>no, not the
angels of heaven, but my Father only.  </p>

<p>This is as Acts 1:7 told us.  This is in the Father&rsquo;s
power.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 24:37-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>Those poor people must not have been warned.  They must not
have heard that a flood was coming.  They must not have known that God had told
Noah that it would be 120 years and then He would bring the flood.  They must
not have heard when God went to Noah and said, &ldquo;Yet seven days and this will be
the year, the month, and the date of the flood.&rdquo;  They must not have known.  </p>

<p>Is this true of the people of Noah&rsquo;s day?  Were they not
warned?  Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of righteousness&rdquo; and he was building an ark
somewhere, probably in his backyard.  He was building this huge craft and he
would have told anyone who would have wanted to listen.  He would have told
people that did not even want to listen, &ldquo;Here is what God has warned me about
and here is what is going to happen,&rdquo; and yet they did not believe it.  </p>

<p>You see, when it says that they &ldquo;knew not,&rdquo; it is not that
they did not hear this.  It is that they did not understand this as truth. 
They did not believe it.  They did not act upon it&mdash;until the flood came.  </p>

<p>When the waters of heaven opened, as well as the waters from
beneath, and this torrent came upon the world of that day, they could then see
that the amount of water that was coming upon the earth was just incredible, &ldquo;We
have never seen anything like this!  Noah warned about this on this very day.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>You see, once they could feel the rain and once they could
touch it and see it and hear it and all of their senses could gather that this
was happening, then they knew.  Then they knew, and yet God did forewarn them
through Noah.  </p>

<p>Then He tells us in Matthew 24:39:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>As this message of May 21, 2011 goes into all of the world,
people are not going to act upon it, except for those whom God draws.  The
unsaved are going to continue on&mdash;just like the people of Noah&rsquo;s day&mdash;until the
ground begins to shake and until the graves begin to open and until they see
God&rsquo;s people ascending up into Heaven to be with the Lord.  They will continue
on&mdash;until it is shown to be fact.  </p>

<p>It is then that they will say, &ldquo;I can see it.  I can hear
the screams.  My senses perceive that this is true, this is happening.  This is
occurring and this means that the Bible was true.  God&rsquo;s people were true as
they were warning me about this and sharing this information with me.&rdquo;  It is
then that they will know.  They will know the month, the day, the year, and the
hour.  They will have all of it figured out.  It is then when there will be the
cries of &ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo; from all of these people trying to get into Heaven.  </p>

<p>In Luke 13:24, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.  </p>

<p>There is another verse in Matthew that speaks of the narrow
way that few find and the broad way that many are going in thereat to
destruction.  That is a different verse than this.  This verse is saying that
many are going to seek to go in &ldquo;at the strait gate.&rdquo;  This is not what it says
in the Gospel of Matthew.  It says there that many are quite happy (I am adding
this part) to go down the road to destruction, that wide way that is open to
all of the religions of the world and all the false gospels of Christianity. 
They are content there.  </p>

<p>It is only when the door is shut, as Luke 13 goes on to
describe in the next verse, that many will then desire to go through that
straight gate, the true Gospel way, the one that God has been revealing in
these last days.  This is because they will then see it.  </p>

<p>Well, Jesus told Thomas, &ldquo;You believe because you can see Me
and because you can feel Me, and yet blessed are those who believe who have not
seen.&rdquo;  And as we read about Noah, this is what faith is, is it not?  </p>

<p>In Hebrews 11:7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet&hellip;  </p>

<p>Being warned of things not seen, Noah built the ark.  He
trusted God and He believed God, like the Ninevites who only heard one
sentence, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Man&rsquo;s mind can come up with a thousand reasons as to why he
does not have to listen to this warning, but faith, the faith that God gives to
His people, can hear this.  Faith sees this.  Faith understands that this is so
and that this is going to happen.  This is because God has opened up the eyes
of His people and He is leading them in the light towards this day.  </p>

<p>Let us have a word of prayer.  Dear Heavenly Father, we do
thank You for Your Word and for forewarning us.  This is troubling information
for this world.  It is very difficult to let go of this world, and yet we know
that Your people are given a hope for a new heaven and a new earth, a new
world.  Therefore, we are not troubled by losing another 20 or 30 or 40 or 50
years of life in this world, especially since life in this world is full of
trouble and evil.  It is full of things that are contrary to You and Your
Word.  Father, we know that it is much easier for a child of God to agree with
You on this in Your Word and to understand it and to even be comforted by it. 
On the other hand, we also know that if anyone is not saved, this world is all
that they know; this is all that they can really perceive and understand, and we
realize that they do not want to give this up.  Father, we do thank You that
this is not a matter of our will and our wants and our desires, but You will
make Your people willing in the day of Your power and draw them to Yourself,
even against their will.  So we do pray that You would open up the eyes of our
children that they might see the day that they are living in and understand the
time, that it is very short.  May You guide them step-by-step into that narrow
way.  Father, we pray that You would have mercy on anyone here who may not yet
be a child of God.  We ask that You would bless Your Word to their hearts and
minds and that You would give them life.  Father, we pray for wisdom today.  In
everything that we do, please give us wisdom towards every person in every
situation.  May You open up a door that no man can shut and shut the door on
the enemy that none can open.  Father, we thank You once again for Your Word. 
We pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>

<p>(There was no question/answer session pertaining to this
