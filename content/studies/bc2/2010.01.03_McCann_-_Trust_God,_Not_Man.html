<p>Let us go to Proverbs 3 and I will read the first several
verses there.  Proverbs 3:1-7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
commandments: For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to
thee. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write
them upon the table of thine heart: So shalt thou find favour and good
understanding in the sight of God and man. Trust in JEHOVAH with all thine
heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge
him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear
JEHOVAH, and depart from evil.  </p>

<p>I will stop there.  </p>

<p>For a long time, I have thought about these verses and what
God is saying here.  This is a passage that is very helpful to the child of
God, to the Christian, in their life.  I have wondered how many people might
have thought about these verses or meditated on these verses or tried to
memorize these verses, because this passage is very comforting to the
believer.  This is God Himself speaking to us, to His people, and saying, &ldquo;Trust
 Me.  Trust in the Lord.  Trust Jehovah.&rdquo;  He is also telling us what not to
trust or whom not to trust: you and me, ourselves.  Do not trust yourself.  </p>

<p>This is unheard of in the world.  We are not to trust
ourselves?  Away with that kind of idea!  You have to be all that you can be. 
You are the one!  You are the man!  Wisdom is in you!  It is all up to you. 
You have to do it.  You can do it.  </p>

<p>The world thinks so very highly of a person&rsquo;s self.  Anyone
who would take God at His Word here and not lean upon his own understanding
could cause others to want to counsel you.  They might even want to put you
through some kind of therapy where you will need to see a psychiatrist or a
psychologist because you have such a bad self-image.  They will believe that
you will really need to improve your self-image.  Like yourself!  Love yourself! 
Trust yourself!  This is the attitude of the world.  This is what the world
says in numerous ways.  </p>

<p>Well, God does not say this.  The Bible does not say this. 
God says, &ldquo;Trust Me.  Trust the Lord.  Trust in Jehovah.&rdquo;  This, of course, is
something that has always been very important, but this is extremely important
today, in our day.  One big reason for this is because of what God says in Daniel
12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even
</i>to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Daniel 12:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are </i>closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white,
and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand; but the wise shall understand.  </p>

<p>God is saying that He gave information in the Bible
concerning the end of the world and He sealed it up till the time of the end. 
He is saying that once the world reaches the time of the end, He will open up
the seals and reveal things to His people from His Word, and then knowledge
will increase.  They will then know many things that they were never able to
know before.  The Lord also tells us that only the wise will understand this
and that none of the wicked will understand.  </p>

<p>Why does God say this?  Is this because only very
intelligent people or only very well-educated people will be able to understand
this?  Is that what He means by saying that the wise will understand?  </p>

<p>No, He does not mean that.  He means that only His chosen
people who were predestinated from the foundation of the world will be able to
understand this.  When God speaks of the wise, He has in mind the elect.  This
is because when a person becomes saved, they receive the Holy Spirit.  They
receive the Spirit of Christ, and Jesus is Wisdom.  He is the personification
of wisdom.  He Himself is said to be wise.  </p>

<p>For instance, if we go to 1 Corinthians 1:17-21, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. For
the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us
which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
Where <i>is </i>the wise? where <i>is </i>the scribe? where <i>is </i>the
disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For
after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased
God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  </p>

<p>This is an interesting way that God puts this.  It is by His
wisdom that the world by its wisdom does not know Him.  </p>

<p>Let us read 1 Corinthians 1:21 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not
God&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is how it is today.  The world by its own wisdom does
not know God.  </p>

<p>This is the reason why the theory of evolution is being
taught as a fact in the schools.  The theory of evolution is not put forth by
idiots.  It is not put forth by stupid people.  It is put forth by the best
minds of the educators of the world.  The best minds, the scientists, the most
intelligent people have studied this issue and they have determined that we
were not created and that, instead, we somehow evolved from lesser lifeforms
that have turned into us, as well as the whole world that we see around us.  </p>

<p>This is the wisdom of the world.  The world has decided that
this is what happened.  They think that there is no God; so, of course,
creation is ridiculous to them.  Instead, it makes more sense to them that
there was a big bang and then some ooze developed from which everything began
to develop, to where we now have all of this complex life that we see all
around us.  The world sees this as being really very simple.  Not only that,
but this happened tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or billions of years ago,
depending on which book you are reading or which author you are listening to.  </p>

<p>Well, it is great for the wise of this world that they were
able to figure this out and that they were able to learn this, because then
this means that there is no God and that nobody has to be concerned with sin or
with the wrath of God or with the judgment of God upon sin because, to them,
all of this is foolishness.  To them, this is all something that certain
religious and crazy people have been leaning on and trusting and believing in
because they just cannot make it in this life and in this world without
trusting in this kind of thing.  They believe that those who trust in God need
some kind of crutch, something to get them through the day.  They also believe
that those who believe in God are not enlightened like they are.  </p>

<p>In actuality, it is a relatively small remnant of the world who
developed this theory of evolution and puts it out there.  But, basically, this
is the wisdom of the world; and the world, God says, by wisdom knew not God. 
The Lord permitted this; He allowed it.  He could clearly have prevented this
kind of idea and teaching that has practically taken over the whole world, but
instead He allowed this because this was part of His plan.  </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:21-22 goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:  </p>

<p>For example, Plato and some of the philosophers we hear
about.  </p>

<p>It goes on in 1 Corinthians 1:23-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; But unto them which are called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness
of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.  </p>

<p>Now let us go to 1 Corinthians 1:30:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:  </p>

<p>He is Wisdom.  If you read Proverbs 8, it clearly teaches that
Jesus is personified as wisdom.  </p>

<p>So when God saves a person and He gives that individual a
new heart and a new spirit, that is Christ in them, the Holy Spirit, the Lord
Jesus, and He is Wisdom.  Therefore, even a baby, like John the Baptist, upon
the moment of salvation, is counted wise, or a thief on the cross a couple of
hours before his death after a wasted life is counted wise, or anyone else at
the time that God saves them is counted wise.  It has nothing to do with their
intellect, with their education or anything like that.  It only has to do with
whether or not Christ, who is Wisdom, is in them.  </p>

<p>However, if you do not have the Spirit of God, you are a
fool.  And this is the distinction that God makes in the Bible of the whole
human race.  There are fools and there are those who are wise.  </p>

<p>The people of the world highly regard and respect
education.  If you ask them, &ldquo;How is someone counted wise?  What do you
consider a wise person to be?,&rdquo; their response would most likely be, &ldquo;Well,
number one, a wise person is someone who has graduated from high school, then
goes to college, and graduates from college.&rdquo;  There is some wisdom in that;
however, if someone goes on to get a Master&rsquo;s Degree, then they have picked up
a little bit more wisdom as well as respect in the eyes of others.  Then if
someone goes from there to get a Doctorate Degree, whether they become a
physician for a PhD in something, then they have attained a certain plateau of
wisdom and they are then, of course, considered to be a wise person.  </p>

<p>Many times, it is the doctors, the scientists or the medical
doctors, who have developed theories like the theory of evolution, and, of
course, they cannot be spoken against, especially by the common people,
especially by all those who do not have all of this education.  We are
considered ignorant.  We just do not understand properly what they learned in
college or in medical school or in law school or in whatever higher degree of
learning that they were in.  </p>

<p>Actually, I am kind of being cynical and I am not speaking
truly, but this is the way that the world operates; this is the way that the
world views things.  But the Bible tells us that many of the scientists or many
of those who would do away with God are biased, those who would do away with
God with theories like the theory of evolution.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Romans 1:18.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>

<p>This means that they suppress the truth.  </p>

<p>I think that there is a good example of this recently with the
subject of global warming.  We were told that global warming was going to
destroy the earth if something was not done about it.  Of course, God&rsquo;s people
realize that May 21, 2011 will be Judgment Day and that five months later the
earth will be destroyed.  We know that it is not going to be by global
warming.  In one way, it will be a very severe global warming as God says that
He will melt this whole universe with fervent heat.  It will be destroyed by
fire, but I do not think that this is what they had in mind by global warming. 
</p>

<p>However, this was an example of very highly trained people
in their field, great scientists, well renowned in the world, who were recently
discovered through emails that they had been sending back and forth to be
suppressing the truth of certain facts dealing with global warming in the last
couple of decades.  They did this because their findings did not agree with
their position, which was that the world needed to do something.  </p>

<p>Now, I do not want to get into politics because I do not
care about politics.  We only have about 500 days left and it does not matter
whether or not we are spending millions or billions of dollars to combat global
warming because it is never going to happen, so this is really not a problem.  </p>

<p>I just think that this illustrates that here were these men,
the very same men who put forth the theory of evolution and who deny God, and
these men were hiding facts and information about global warming because they
were biased.  They were not honestly examining all of the facts, which is what
a scientist should do.  </p>

<p>God knew this was the nature of man thousands of years ago. 
Continuing in Romans, He says in Romans 1:18-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold [<i>suppress</i>] the truth in
unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
for God hath showed <i>it </i>unto them. For the invisible things of him from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that
are made, <i>even </i>his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without
excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him </i>not as God,
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  </p>

<p>This is what the Lord said in 1 Corinthians 1.  The world
considers the Gospel and those who bring the Gospel, &ldquo;the preaching of the
cross,&rdquo; as foolishness and fools.  It is foolishness!  Very educated people do
not even talk about the things that come from the Bible.  Very educated people
avoid the Bible completely.  But God says that it pleased Him &ldquo;by the
foolishness of preaching&rdquo; to save His people.  </p>

<p>So let the world think what they will.  Let the best minds,
the brilliant scientists of the world, come up with their theories, but the
Bible tells us what is going on.  It all comes down to whom you trust.  Whom do
you trust?  </p>

<p>We tell the world that May 21, 2011 will be Judgment Day, and it is mocked by many.  &ldquo;Are you kidding?  Are you off your egg?  Are you
just out of your mind?  Are you a gullible fool?  Are you such an idiot that
you would believe this?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, okay.  This is what the world thinks about those who
trust the Bible, when God says to trust in Him, to trust in the Lord, to trust
in Jehovah.  </p>

<p>So let me ask you something that God Himself points out. 
What do you trust in?  What is your trust in?  If you do not trust the Lord, if
you do not trust His Word, if you do not trust the Bible, what do you trust in
that allows you to mock such things?  Whom do you trust in that gives you the
authority to say, &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;?  What is it that your trust is in?  </p>

<p>Well, I thought that, first, it would be a good thing for us
to look at what God tells us not to trust in.  He tells us to trust in the
Lord, but He also tells us in many places what <span class="underline">not</span> to trust in.  I have
several verses.  To begin with, let us go to Psalm 146:3-4.  We read there:</p>

<p class="verse">Put not your trust in princes, <i>nor </i>in the son of man, in
whom <i>there is </i>no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his
earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.  </p>

<p>God is saying, &ldquo;Do not trust princes, nor the son of man.&rdquo; 
Princes would be referring to royalty.  Of course, this could be kings or
princes or anyone with royal blood.  We would say today that this could be
referring to the leaders of governments, the leaders of the world.  Are they
trustworthy?  </p>

<p>Before I get into this, the Bible tells us to obey our
leaders, and we would want to do this in all things lawful.  But to trust them
in their thinking about their perspective of the world or of the creation or of
spiritual things, does anybody trust their government in these things?  Do you
trust the dictators or the kings or the presidents or the prime ministers of
this world?  </p>

<p>I think that most people give evidence that they do not
trust a lot of things their governments do in just about every government on
earth, no matter what style of government.  The people eventually learn not to trust
their government in certain things.  Yet, again, if we are under communism or
socialism or a democracy or a dictatorship, it does not matter because we are
to obey our government in everything lawful.  But we do not trust in them for
information about what comes after death or about what they think is going to
happen on May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Jeremiah 7:4 and look at this verse:    </p>

<p class="verse">Trust ye not in lying words&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are to trust not in lying words, and this is a big
problem for mankind.  This is because the Bible tells us that even at the time
that we are born, we are speaking lies.  Even when we are born, we are speaking
lies in our heart.  This is what the Bible says.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Romans 3:10-13, a passage that most of us are
familiar with:  </p>

<p class="verse">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all
gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that
doeth good, no, not one. Their throat <i>is </i>an open sepulchre; with their
tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <i>is </i>under their lips:  </p>

<p>Using deceit would mean that they are lying.  They are not
being honest, and this is the nature of man.  Man, naturally, is a liar.  This
goes for every person, you and me included.  Man is naturally a liar.  </p>

<p>Look at Roman 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a fact.  Did you ever meet a truly honest person? 
You will meet plenty of people who will tell you that they are honest.  You
will meet plenty of people who will tell you that they are basically good
people.  You will find that many people testify these things of themselves, but
find a person who has never lied.  You can ask even those who say that they are
basically good, &ldquo;Have you ever lied?&rdquo;  And we do not have to be fifty years old
to lie.  Do children lie?  Do they lie when they get caught doing something
that they should not be doing?  Do they point to a sibling?  Yes, because we
are all natural liars.  When we are put on the spot, we lie.  </p>

<p>Does this change when we get older and become a scientist
and we develop a theory called evolution?  No, especially if we have a position
that we would really like to hold onto, especially if there is a bias.  Like those
concerned with global warming, they had a bias.  They wanted those facts and
that information to be true so that they could teach, &ldquo;Yes, the earth is
warming,&rdquo; because their whole business was involved with it.  </p>

<p>What is the benefit for those who teach evolution and who
basically say that there is no God?  Well, they think that they get freedom,
freedom to do what they want as they wish, which really means that they just
want to sin at will and to live a life without constraint and without fear of
an angry and wrathful God judging them.  </p>

<p>So there is strong motivation in all of this for man who is
naturally a liar&mdash;he is born a liar&mdash;to kind of cover over the facts a little
bit.  But God says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God.&rdquo;  The entire
universe with the sun and the moon and the stars teach us that there is a
Creator and a God.  There is no way that anyone could actually be thinking
reasonably if they are thinking that this world came into being&mdash;with all of
this complex life within it&mdash;through itself somehow.  That is not even a
possibility.  It was not even possible for that to have happened.  </p>

<p>Well, God says that He is true.  &ldquo;Let God be true,&rdquo; and He
is true.  He says, &ldquo;Thy word is truth.&rdquo;  It is impossible for God to lie, but
it is very possible for man to lie.  So whom do you trust?  Whom are you
leaning on?  You say that you do not believe this information concerning May 21, 2011, &ldquo;That is just silly.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The sad thing is that many people are going to trust their
buddies and their friends.  This is because when you try to bring something
like this up to your friends, they say something like, &ldquo;Are you for real?  Are
you serious?&rdquo;  Or you get that smirk, &ldquo;Get out of here with that!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Is this all the evidence that they have?  They have a simple,
superficial, negative comment and that is supposed to tell you how ridiculous
this information on May 21 is?  But where is their proof?  Where is their
evidence?  What are they trusting in?  How dare they just write this off just
like that!  Where did they get their wisdom from to make that kind of
declaration?  </p>

<p>So that is it?  A few friends mock this information and so
you are going to believe them?  You are going to trust them?  Really, would you
trust them with other things in your life?  Would you trust them with your
valuables?  Are they really that trustworthy?  Would you give them your money? 
Would you give them the things that you are very concerned for and care about
in this life?  </p>

<p>No.  No, you would not do this; however, it goes deeper than
this because that bias is also in you as well as in the scientists.  It is in
your nature.  It is in who you are, because every man is a liar.  </p>

<p>Let us also look at a few more verses.  Let us turn back to
Jeremiah 7:4 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Trust ye not in lying words&hellip;  </p>

<p>Also look at Jeremiah 9:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk
with slanders.  </p>

<p>We could look at this in a couple of different ways.  Number
one; do not trust your neighbors.  Number two; do not trust your family
members.  Number three; do not trust your spiritual family members, as Christians
do at times speak of fellow Christians as brothers or sisters.  </p>

<p>We are living in the time of Great Tribulation, and God
says, &ldquo;Do not trust princes, do not trust the son of man, and do not trust
brothers/sisters or neighbors.  Do not trust them.  They are not trustworthy
because they can lie.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So whom do we trust?  Well, we keep coming back to that
trust in the Lord.  Trust in Jehovah, yes, but do not trust these other things,
these other people.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Jeremiah 17.  Jeremiah 17:5-7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH; Cursed <i>be </i>the man that trusteth in
man&hellip;  </p>

<p>Jesus knew what was in man.  Do we know what is in man?  Do
we recognize that man is spiritually dead and that he is in rebellion against
God and that he will do anything to avoid the light of the Gospel of the Bible
from shining in his life to reveal that he is not as good as he would like to
think that he is, that he is not as great as he would maybe present himself to
others.  Rather, he is inwardly full of all manner of iniquity and wickedness
and evil that flows from within his heart.  He, therefore, does not like the
Word of God because it reveals these things to him.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Cursed <i>be </i>the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh
his arm, and whose heart departeth from JEHOVAH. For he shall be like the heath
in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the
parched places in the wilderness, <i>in </i>a salt land and not inhabited. Blessed

<i>is </i>the man that trusteth in JEHOVAH, and whose hope JEHOVAH is.  </p>

<p>Trust in the Lord.  Trust in Jehovah.  Do not trust in man. 
</p>

<p>A big reason why is because of what we read in verse 9,
Jeremiah 17:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heart <i>is </i>deceitful above all <i>things, </i>and
desperately wicked: who can know it?  </p>

<p>What does deceitful mean?  It means to lie, to deceive, to
trick.  And man&rsquo;s heart is so deceitful that God says that it is deceitful &ldquo;above
all.&rdquo;  So the biggest liar you know is yourself.  It is you.  You may not even
know this, because God says: </p>

<p class="verse">The heart <i>is </i>deceitful above all <i>things, </i>and
desperately wicked: who can know it?  </p>

<p>You may not even realize that you are lying to yourself. 
You might think that all is well with you according to the way in which you
paint that picture of yourself to yourself.  Everything about your whole life
may be one big lie because this is the nature of man.  This is why God warns, &ldquo;Do
not trust yourself or anybody else who is in this world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No human being alive now on the face of the earth should be
trusted.  Actually, we should also not be trusting in the dead human beings who
have written confessions and creeds and theologies and doctrines.  They are not
to be trusted either; only the Lord, only God.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Micah 7 and look at Micah 7:5-7.  </p>

<p class="verse">Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Confidence&rdquo; means the same as &ldquo;trust.&rdquo;  Again and again and
again, God is saying that we are not to trust whomever you can think of.  </p>

<p>Of course, we do not want to be paranoid as we think of
others.  Yes, we have learned that we can trust some people to hold our money. 
Yes, we have learned that we can trust some people to keep our secrets.  Yes,
we have learned that we can trust some people to be our friends.  But none of
this is the same thing as trusting someone with such an incredibly important
matter as that of the Word of God and the Gospel and whether or not May 21 in
2011 is Judgment Day, because what do they really know?  </p>

<p>This is especially true if you are young and you have young
friends; for example, if you are ten and your friends are between 10 and 12, or
if you are a teenager and your friends are 13 or 14 or 15 or 16.  How much do
they really know?  How much information can a young person gain in this world
in such a short period of time?  How much do they really know?  Do not even
compare them to the geniuses of the world, but compare their knowledge to God
and His Infinite Mind.  He tells us that His thoughts are higher than our
thoughts and that His ways are above our ways &ldquo;<i>as </i>the heavens are higher
than the earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is how great His thoughts are, and so He tells us: </p>

<p class="verse">Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep
the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. For the son
dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the
daughter in law against her mother in law; a man&rsquo;s enemies <i>are </i>the men
of his own house.  </p>

<p>Do not even trust Mom.  Do not trust Mom.  This is what the
Bible says, not when it comes to truth.  Children, yes, you are to obey your
parents.  For those of you who have wonderful mothers whom God has saved and
are instructing you, that is good; however, still the responsibility for each
person is to check out whatever it is that we hear when someone is teaching
from the Bible.  We are responsible for checking it out to see if it is so, as
best we can.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore I will look unto JEHOVAH; I will wait for the God of
my salvation: my God will hear me.  </p>

<p>Again, God tells us whom not to trust.  He just basically
covers the whole earth.  He covers the whole world and all of the people in
it.  </p>

<p>Let us look at another verse.  Let us go to Proverbs 28:26: 
</p>

<p class="verse">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
wisely, he shall be delivered.  </p>

<p>If you even trust in your own heart, you are a fool.  Why? 
Because it is &ldquo;desperately wicked&rdquo; and &ldquo;deceitful above all things.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know that many professing Christians trust that somehow
they are a child of God.  We know that there are nearly two billion professing Christians
in this world, and we know that the great majority of them are deceived. </p>

<p>So God is telling us not to trust in our own thinking, not to
not trust in our own understanding, as He says in Proverbs 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Trust in JEHOVAH with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
own understanding.  </p>

<p>What if I decided that there was a nice solid wall in front
of me here when there is nothing here?  If I decided to put all of my weight on
it, is it going to hold me up?  No.  I am going to hit the floor and I could
wind up hurting myself.  </p>

<p>Well, God is saying that what we trust in is what we lean
on, and He is the only One who is worthy of our trust and nobody else, nobody
else, only God, not even our own selves.  We are not to even lean on our own
understanding.  </p>

<p>We have common sense, of course, and sometimes we get things
right.  We know not to walk in certain neighborhoods at certain times.  We can
figure out a lot of things that have to do with everyday living.  But when it
comes to the truth of the Bible and what God is opening up from the Scriptures
concerning these last days and the time that remains, we would be a fool to
trust in our own thoughts or in our own thinking.  We are to not to lean on that
in anyway at all.  God says to trust in Him.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 37:1-5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, and wither as the green herb. Trust in JEHOVAH, and do good; <i>so </i>shalt
thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in
JEHOVAH; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto
JEHOVAH; trust also in him; and he shall bring <i>it </i>to pass.  </p>

<p>This is what God is doing now.  He is testing all of us. 
The entire period of the Great Tribulation has been a time of testing.  This is
why so many of these doctrines have been uncovered.  These are tests that are
designed to aim right at our hearts, and they are also tests to see if we
believe Him and if we trust Him, if we trust God.  </p>

<p>If not and we do not trust God, who is it that we do trust? 
These tests can reveal this.  They can show us that maybe we are trusting in
our family, &ldquo;After all, they speak so badly about these things, so I am not
going to continue listening to these new doctrines.&rdquo;  Or maybe we are trusting
in our friends, because our friends want nothing to do with the Bible or with
the Gospel, &ldquo;Every time I bring these things up, they kind of mock me and it
causes me to feel badly.  I like my friends and I want to keep them, so I am
going to just stay with them and I no longer want anything else to do with this
information that is coming from the Bible.&rdquo;  Or maybe we are trusting in some knowledgeable
theologian or in some pastor or in some church.  However, if we are trusting in
anyone or anything other than the Bible, God is going to reveal this to us
because He tells us whom to trust: Him alone.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Psalm 119 and just read one last verse.  Psalm
119:42 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for
I trust in thy word.  </p>

<p>May 21, 2011 comes from the Bible, only the Bible.  It is
derived from the Bible, which means that we can trust this wholeheartedly,
absolutely, and completely.  This is because God completely identifies with His
Word and He tells us to trust Him, &ldquo;Trust My Word.&rdquo;  To &ldquo;trust in the Lord&rdquo; is
to trust what the Bible says.  </p>

<p>May 21, 2011 did not come out of a hat.  It is not a theory
put forth by a council of pastors.  This did not come from any other source
than the Bible.  So do we trust God?  Do we really trust Him?  Are we going to
lean on Him and not on our own thinking or on the thoughts of others?  Since
God is true and every man is a liar, He is the only One who is to be trusted
and is trustworthy because His Words are true and faithful.  </p>

<p>Let us close with a word of prayer.  Dear Heavenly Father,
we do pray that You would grant us faith and trust in You, that we would cast
our cares upon You, for you care for us.  We pray that we would follow You and
realize that we only have a short amount of time to do what you would have us
to do as Your servants.  Father, we pray that You would have mercy on our
children, that as we go along and as they hear their friends or neighbors or
anyone else say things that are contrary to Your Word, we pray that they might
think, &ldquo;Well, where does that person get their authority?  And how can they
make that kind of statement?&rdquo;  Father, we pray that You would save them.  We
are thankful that You saved Noah and his family and Lot and some of his family,
so we do know that You do work in families.  You tell us that You save &ldquo;one of
a city, and two of a family.&rdquo;  Lord, we pray that You would have mercy on all
of our children, even though we know that it is in Your hands and that You will
save whom You will save and have mercy on whom You will have mercy.  We do ask
that You would open their eyes and make them wise, for &ldquo;the wise man&rsquo;s eyes <i>are

</i>in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness.&rdquo;  We do pray that You would help
them to see just exactly where we are and that they would be warned and take
warning.  Father, we ask for Your blessing on Your Word, once again, and we
pray that You would guide us the rest of this day and that You might bless
those who are handing out tracts and those who will be receiving them.  We also
ask that You would bless Family Radio as they send Your Gospel out into the
world today, and we pray for those people who are in India and Pakistan, those
who will be under the hearing of Family Radio.  May you lead more of Your elect
people to listen, to hear, and to become saved.  We pray that You would
strengthen Mr. Camping and continue to give him wisdom towards Your Word and
open up his understanding even more as we go along.  For all of those who work
at Family Radio, we ask that You would bless all of them there and their
families also.  Father, we pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </p>
