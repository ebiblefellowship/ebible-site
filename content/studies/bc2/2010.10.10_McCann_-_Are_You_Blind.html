  A look at what God says about spiritual blindness.
---
<p>I do not know if you are aware of how many blind people
there are in the world.  I just recently looked this up.  There are estimates of
between 40-45 million legally blind people in the world.  I thought that this
was kind of a low number considering that there are nearly seven billion
people; but still, out of these 40-45 million people who are from all of the
different nations, 1.4 million of them are children.  Most people become blind
as they get older.  They lose their sight as it gets worse and worse until they
are legally blind, but there are 40-45 million blind people.  </p>

<p>We know that all throughout history there have been blind
people.  We read of Christ opening up the eyes of the blind in the Bible. 
Someone who is totally blind will have no perception of light.  Others can be
legally blind, but they can still perceive some light.  They can maybe make out
some things.  If you remember, there is one account of a man in the Bible whom Christ
healed.  It was a two-part healing.  In the first part, he saw &ldquo;men as trees,
walking.&rdquo;  Things were still very blurry; he could not quite make things out. 
Then Jesus completely healed him and he saw things normally, just like we see
today.  </p>

<p>Most people see normally.  We can see the trees.  We can see
the grass.  We can see mountains and streams.  We can see other people.  We see
colors and shapes, and it is really a great blessing to be able to see; and yet
there are some people who have always been in the world as people who cannot
see.  </p>

<p>Those who are physically blind are actually a great example
of something that the Bible talks about, which is spiritual blindness. 
Spiritual blindness is on a different realm.  It is not associated with
physical blindness.  We understand physical blindness.  We expect certain
things of physically blind people because we know that they are blind and that
they cannot see; but spiritual blindness is on a totally different level.  We
do not know if someone is spiritually blind or not, but one thing we do know is
that everyone born into the world is spiritually blind.  This is because we are
born in sin and we are brought into this world in this sinful condition.  </p>

<p>Let us look at some of what God says about spiritual
blindness.  We read in 2 Corinthians 3:12-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
speech: And not as Moses, <i>which </i>put a veil over his face, that the
children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is
abolished: But their minds were <span class="underline">blinded</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>A little further on in 2 Corinthians 4, there is another
reference to being blinded, but these are two different Greek words for the
word that was translated &ldquo;blinded.&rdquo;  This particular word is a word that is
used, for example, in John 12:40.  We read in John 12:37-40:  </p>

<p class="verse">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
believed not on him: That the saying of Esaias [<i>Isaiah</i>] the prophet
might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to
whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe,
because that Esaias [<i>Isaiah</i>] said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and
<span class="underline">hardened</span> their heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; in John 12:40 is not the same word.  The
word &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; is the same word that we find translated as &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; in 2
Corinthians 3:14.  In 2 Corinthians 3:14, it says:</p>

<p class="verse">But their minds were <span class="underline">blinded</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>And here in John 12:40, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He hath blinded their eyes, and <span class="underline">hardened</span> their heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>He has blinded their minds or hardened their heart, which is
basically another way of saying the same thing.  </p>

<p>Let us finish this verse in John 12:40, and then I will
return to 2 Corinthians 3.  It says in John 12:40:  </p>

<p class="verse">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
should not see with <i>their </i>eyes, nor understand with <i>their </i>heart,
and be converted, and I should heal them.  </p>

<p>Who hardened their heart?  Who blinded their eyes?  It was
God.  We will talk about this a little bit later.  For now, let us go back to 2
Corinthians 3.  We read in 2 Corinthians 3:14-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">But their minds were blinded [<i>or hardened</i>]: for until
this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old
testament; which <i>veil </i>is done away in Christ. But even unto this day,
when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless when it shall
turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit:
and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is, </i>there <i>is </i>liberty. But we
all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even </i>as by the Spirit of the
Lord.  </p>

<p>Chapter 4, 2 Corinthians 4:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
mercy, we faint not; But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by
manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man&rsquo;s conscience in
the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
should shine unto them.  </p>

<p>God is saying that man is blind.  Mankind is blind.  If you
remember, we read in the Fourth Gospel 1 that the world was in darkness and
then came the Light into the world, which was Christ.  It says, &ldquo;And the light
shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.&rdquo;  God uses this
figure because mankind is in darkness, and this is about the best way that we
can explain blindness.  If you are blind, you are in the dark and you cannot
see.  If you are blind, you cannot see anything.  </p>

<p>I am sure that just about everyone at one point or another
has tried to experience what it is like to be blind.  You close your eyes and
try to make your way across the room, even though this is not what it would be
like in every case because there are levels of blindness.  In those who have no
light perception, this is exactly how it is.  It is dark and you cannot make
things out.  </p>

<p>Once again, it says in 2 Corinthians 4:4:   </p>

<p class="verse">In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
which believe not&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who is it who blinded the people whom we read about in the
Fourth Gospel?  Was it Satan?  No; it was God.  Who is &ldquo;the god of this world&rdquo;? 
He is God.  God is the One who blinds.  We do not read about Satan blinding
anyone, but we do read that God is the One who blinds.  </p>

<p>Look at Exodus 4:11.  By the way, just to make sure that
proper credit is given, I heard this in one of Mr. Camping&rsquo;s studies.  This is
not something that I discovered.  In Exodus 4:11, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto him, Who hath made man&rsquo;s mouth? or who
maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I JEHOVAH?  </p>

<p>God makes blind; God makes deaf; He makes dumb.  This is
true on a physical level and this is true on the spiritual level.  This is
because it is God who cursed man.  He cursed man when man sinned.  As a result
of this curse, He spiritually blinded man.  Actually, we say that man is
spiritually blind, but the condition of mankind is far worse than this.  We are
also deaf, we are also dumb, we are also lame, and we are also dead.  This is
why we are blind, because we are dead.  This is why we are deaf, because we are
dead.  This is why we are dumb, because we are dead.  This is why we cannot
walk in the commandments of God.  We are lame because we are dead.  We are dead
in sin.  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us this very clearly in Ephesians 2:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And you <i>hath he quickened&hellip;  </i></p>

<p>What does &ldquo;quickened&rdquo; mean?  Even though it is in italics,
it carries the idea here of being brought to life.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And you <i>hath he quickened </i>[<i>made alive</i>]<i>, </i>who
were dead in trespasses and sins:  </p>

<p>We were dead.  We were dead, dead, dead, dead, dead,
spiritually dead.  It is like taking your Bible and going to your local
cemetery.  There is a nice, big one near me.  So go take your Bible, find a
nice area, find a nice tombstone, one that you think will give you the best
possibility for some individual to come out of the grave and arise, and start
preaching to them.  Start preaching to them.  </p>

<p>As you start preaching to them, what is the individual in
the grave going to hear?  Preach to him from sun up to sun down.  What is he
going to hear?  He is going to hear nothing.  What is he going to see?  He is
not going to see anything.  Is he going to rise up?  No, he is going to stay
dead.  </p>

<p>This is a good illustration for us.  It should really cause
us to relax when we are sharing the Gospel and to not get uptight or to
definitely not get angry with others.  Do not get frustrated because what do
you expect?  What do you expect when you share the Word of God and people do
not understand about May 21 or any other teaching from the Bible?  </p>

<p>Does anybody in the cemetery understand?  Do they see it? 
Do they get it?  No.  No.  Well, obviously, you would not get frustrated with
them.  If you were in a cemetery, you would just walk away and think, &ldquo;That was
a foolish thing for me to do!  It was foolish for me to expect them to hear, to
expect them to understand, to expect them to rise up.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The only difference is that people who are alive but
spiritually dead still have physical life.  They have physical life.  This is
why when we do speak to others, we can sometimes misinterpret the fact that
they have physical life to indicate that they have spiritual life and that they
should see and that they should hear and that they should understand.  No; we
should never make this mistake.  </p>

<p>You might ask then, &ldquo;Well, why teach?  Why preach?  Why
share the Gospel?&rdquo;  We do this because there is God who raises the dead.  He
raised Lazarus.  He raised the widow&rsquo;s son.  He raised the twelve-year-old
girl.  There is God who told the prophet Ezekiel to preach to the dead bones. 
God asked Ezekiel a question back in Ezekiel 37.  Let us go there.  We read in
Ezekiel 37:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">The hand of JEHOVAH was upon me, and carried me out in the
spirit of JEHOVAH, and set me down in the midst of the valley which <i>was </i>full
of bones, And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <i>there were

</i>very many in the open valley; and, lo, <i>they were </i>very dry. And he
said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord JEHOVAH,
thou knowest.  </p>

<p>From our perspective, if it was just us, could those bones
live?  No.  There would be no possible way that they could rise up, but we know
that God is the One who told us to go into all the world with the Gospel, just
like He is telling Ezekiel to preach to the dry bones.  Ezekiel obeyed what God
commanded him to do in Ezekiel 37:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the word of the LORD.&rdquo;  God commanded Lazarus, &ldquo;Lazarus,
come forth.&rdquo;  How did he hear this?  Lazarus was dead, so how could he hear? 
We know that Lazarus heard because he got up and came out of the tomb with his
grave clothes on, and then he approached Jesus.  Lazarus heard because Christ
gave him life and ears to hear.  It was because &ldquo;faith <i>cometh </i>by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is why we preach.  We share Scripture.  We give a
tract.  Whatever we do, we do it because we have hope.  We know that God is
going to save a great multitude today, and it could be any one of the dead.  It
could be any one of those who are presently dead in trespasses and sins, and
God is the One who has blinded the minds of them in this world.</p>

<p>We could also look at 2 Thessalonians 2.  This passage does
not mention blindness; but, spiritually, this is actually a part of being
blind.  We read in 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
had pleasure in unrighteousness.  </p>

<p>God is blinding their eyes in a spiritual sense, so let us
look at what actual spiritual blindness is.  </p>

<p>By the way, I forgot to ask this question at the beginning. 
The question is: are you blind?  Are <span class="underline">you</span> blind?  Do you know it?  Of
course, you would know this if you were physically blind; but how many people
are spiritually blind and yet think that they can see?  We would guess over two
billion, because this is the estimated number of people who think that they are
 Christians.  They think that they have &ldquo;eyes to see.&rdquo;  But really, &ldquo;Are you blind?&rdquo;

is the question that I think God wants each of us to ask.  How would we even
know?  </p>

<p>First of all, let us see what spiritual blindness is.  We
read in Ephesians 4:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having
the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the
ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:  </p>

<p>This is spiritual blindness.  It is ignorance.  </p>

<p>God tells us, &ldquo;Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing,
that one day <i>is </i>with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.&rdquo;  Be not ignorant!  Do not lack understanding of this, because it
would be spiritual blindness if you do.  </p>

<p>Spiritual blindness is &ldquo;having the understanding darkened.&rdquo; 
Romans 3:10 tells us, &ldquo;There is none righteous.&rdquo;  How many understand?  Romans 3:11 says, &ldquo;There is none that understandeth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This tells us that everyone, every human being, is
spiritually blind.  This is where we are.  We have no understanding of the truth
of the Word of God.  We are in darkness.  God addresses this in Daniel 12. 
Just keep in mind that spiritual blindness is ignorance.  It is a lack of
understanding.  We read in Daniel 12:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise
shall understand.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;None of the wicked&rdquo; refers to those who remain in their
sins.  We are all wicked.  None are righteous.  We all began this way, but God
saves some and He gives the Spirit of Christ, which enlightens the darkness
within us and opens up our ability to understand the Bible so that we can see. 

</p>

<p>There are many hymns that have been written about spiritual
sight and being able to see.  God is indicating today that when He opens up the
Bible, after having it sealed for so long, that none will be able to
spiritually see these things that He is revealing, only His people.  </p>

<p>Or go to Proverbs 28 and look at Proverbs 28:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Evil men understand not judgment&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, they have no understanding, which indicates spiritual
blindness.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but they that seek JEHOVAH understand all <i>things.</i>  </p>

<p>This is a matter of light and darkness or day and night. 
This is why the Bible says, &ldquo;The wise man&rsquo;s eyes <i>are </i>in his head; but
the fool walketh in darkness&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the way of the wicked <i>is </i>as
darkness: they know not at what they stumble.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the condition of mankind, and so we should not be
surprised that so many people lack understanding, that so many people cannot
see that Judgment Day is right at hand.  They do not understand it.  </p>

<p>We also should not be surprised that the churches and
congregations cannot see this.  They say, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  In
other words, &ldquo;The coast is clear.  I do not see anything.  I do not see Christ
coming.  I am watching.  I do not know what you are seeing, but I certainly do
not see any danger ahead.  There is peace and safety.&rdquo;  This is what they are
saying.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at what God has to say about His people,
beginning in Jeremiah 8:7.  Again, keep in mind that, spiritually speaking, a
lack of understanding is blindness.  We read in Jeremiah 8:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and
the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but
my people know not the judgment of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>We will look at a few other verses.  Look at Hosea.  (Hosea
comes after Daniel.)  We read in Hosea 4:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to
me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy
children.  </p>

<p>Or look at Luke 19:43-44:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, And
shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they
shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the
time of thy visitation.  </p>

<p>Again, we see a lack of knowledge, a lack of understanding. 
The reference to &ldquo;one stone upon another&rdquo; is speaking of the church under God&rsquo;s
judgment today.  His people knew not the time of His visitation.  The Jews did
not know that Messiah was there when He stood right in front of them.  </p>

<p>How could they miss the Lord God Almighty in the flesh? 
There is only one answer that I can think of.  They were blind.  They were
blind to the fact that He healed the blind, that He gave ears to the deaf, that
He raised the dead, that He performed many miracles, that He multiplied the
loaves.  They were blind, and so God stood right in their very presence and
they knew not the time of His visitation.  </p>

<p>In our day, the church has learned from Israel, right?  The
churches and congregations of our day are in much better spiritual condition
than Israel was.  Is this so?  No, it is not so.  The churches of our day give
every evidence of having very little understanding of where the Door to Heaven
is, which is very similar to those who pressed upon Lot&rsquo;s house to get in and
God struck them with blindness &ldquo;so that they wearied themselves to find the
door.&rdquo;  This is the condition of the church and congregations of today.  </p>

<p>So when the church is telling us that we do not have
anything to worry about in relation to Judgment Day because we cannot know the
day or hour, this should not really give any of us any comfort.  It should not
give anyone a sense of security that the church is telling them, &ldquo;Do not worry
about this.&rdquo;  This should actually concern us.  </p>

<p>Look what Christ says in Matthew 15:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the spiritual leaders of Israel as well
as the spiritual leaders of our day.  They are &ldquo;blind leaders of the blind.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 23:16-17.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, <i>ye </i>blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the
temple, he is a debtor!<i> Ye </i>fools and blind: for whether is greater, the
gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  </p>

<p>We also read in the same chapter, Matthew 23:24-26:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Ye </i>blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a
camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the
outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion
and excess.<i> Thou </i>blind Pharisee, cleanse first that <i>which is </i>within
the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.  </p>

<p>They are blind, blind, blind.  They cannot see.  They have
no understanding of the truth, and so Christ identifies them as spiritually
blind guides who are trying to lead people into Heaven but are falling into a
ditch themselves.  </p>

<p>There is another reference that God gives that relates to
today.  We read in Isaiah 56:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">His watchmen <i>are </i>blind: they are all ignorant, they <i>are

</i>all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. </p>

<p>God is putting the two together here: they are blind and
they are ignorant.  To be ignorant means that you lack understanding, and so
the watchmen are blind and ignorant and they are dumb dogs.  </p>

<p>You can find a watchdog in most junkyards.  They put a dog
out there.  They do this because as soon as a dog hears something, it goes
running towards the sound, barking very loudly.  If you get a big enough dog,
it can really protect your property.  He will chase anyone who is trying to break
in.  These are classified as watchdogs.  </p>

<p>But God says that the watchmen are blind and ignorant and
that they are like &ldquo;dumb dogs.&rdquo;  A dog that cannot bark is not much use as a
watchdog.  It might be moving its mouth a lot, but it is not making any sound
and you cannot hear it barking.  This is because it is dumb and it cannot
speak.  </p>

<p>Well, Christ set watchmen in the churches and the
congregations.  He set watchmen among His people and told them to &ldquo;watch
therefore.&rdquo;  If you remember, Ezekiel 33 speaks of the watchman.  When he sees &ldquo;the
sword come upon the land,&rdquo; he is to &ldquo;blow the trumpet, and warn the people&rdquo;;
but what if you are blind?  What if you are blind and you are a watchman?  </p>

<p>I hate to do this, but I cannot help it.  &ldquo;F Troop&rdquo; was a
1960&rsquo;s TV show that had a blind character by the name of Vanderbilt.  He was someone
who we would say was legally blind.  He wore very thick glasses that he would
have to squint through in order to see, but they would put him up in a
watchtower.  They would put him in a watchtower to watch for Indians, which was
a running joke because this was a comedy.  </p>

<p>We expect something like this from a comedy, but what is
happening in the churches of our day is a tragedy.  It is a tragedy to have
blind people standing watch for a sword that they cannot see.  They just cannot
see it, and this is what God is getting at.  </p>

<p>What makes this even worse is that these watchmen think that
they can see.  They believe that they can see.  </p>

<p>Go to John 9, which is the account of the man born blind. 
If you remember, the spiritual leaders of Israel gave him a very hard time
because he testified that Christ had given him sight.  Towards the end of this
account, we read in John 9:39-40:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that
they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. And <i>some
</i>of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him,
Are we blind also?  </p>

<p>They are at least asking this question, even though it was
most likely in a sarcastic way, but this question is for us today.  Are we
blind?  Are you blind?  Am I blind?  Would you know if you were spiritually
blind?  Would you know?  </p>

<p>It continues in John 9:40-41:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>some </i>of the Pharisees which were with him heard these
words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? Jesus said unto them, If ye were
blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin
remaineth.  </p>

<p>This is because they thought all was well between them and
God.  They were the leaders.  They were the teachers of Israel: the masters,
the rabbis.  They were the ones who instructed the people that it was the
harlots and the publicans who were the sinners, &ldquo;They are the sinners.  They
are the ones with the problem; not us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you remember, God gave us this example in Luke 18 of the
publican and the Pharisee.  We read in Luke 18:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and
the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I
thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are, </i>extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes
of all that I possess.  </p>

<p>The Pharisee was basically saying, &ldquo;I am righteous.  I can
see.  All is well between me and God&rdquo;; but what was the truth?  What was the
truth?  </p>

<p>What this man was doing is what we read about in Revelation
3:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing; and knowest not&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here is a reference to the lack of knowledge once again.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and
poor, and blind, and naked:  </p>

<p>They do not know.  They think that all is well, that
everything is great and wonderful, but they do not understand.  This is
actually part of the blindness.  Part of being spiritually blind, a big
symptom, is not knowing it and not realizing it.  Many people are in this
condition, and God says to them that they know not that they are blind.  Then
we read in verse 18, Revelation 3:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <i>that </i>the
shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that
thou mayest see.  </p>

<p>Of course, this is through reading the Word of God, through
reading the Bible.  This is how Christ can anoint someone&rsquo;s eyes.  This is how
He opens someone&rsquo;s eyes, and all of the healings of the blind point to this.  </p>

<p>Let us look at this.  Look at Psalm 146:8.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH openeth <i>the eyes of </i>the blind: JEHOVAH raiseth
them that are bowed down: JEHOVAH loveth the righteous:  </p>

<p>So there is a cure for spiritual blindness.  It is not found
in the world.  It is found in God&rsquo;s hands.  </p>

<p>Look also at Isaiah 35:3-5.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say
to them <i>that are </i>of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your
God will come <i>with </i>vengeance, <i>even </i>God <i>with </i>a recompense;
he will come and save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the
ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.  </p>

<p>Do you see how this is connected?  &ldquo;He will come and save
you.&rdquo;  It is then that your eyes are opened.  It is then that your ears can
hear.  </p>

<p>Also in Matthew 9:27-30, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
crying, and saying, <i>Thou </i>son of David, have mercy on us. And when he was
come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them,
Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then
touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And
their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See <i>that </i>no
man know <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>This is not too hard for God.  He just touches them.  We
read of Him spitting and making mud and putting this on one man&rsquo;s eyes, but He
did not even have to do this.  He does not have to do anything like this.  He
can just as easily from Heaven will something to be so as someone is praying to
Him, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy.  O Lord, open my eyes and help me to see.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you know what you will see if God does open your eyes? 
You will see that we are at the very edge of the end of the world.  You will
see that it is not as the world says.  </p>

<p>Some people might wonder, &ldquo;How could Judgment Day be next
year, which is less than 8 months away?  How can Judgment Day be on May 21, 2011?  Look at the world.  Everything is just going along like it normally does. 
Everything is just continuing on.  People do not look afraid.  People do not
look concerned.  People do not look worried.  They are still planning their
educations and planning their future careers.  They are still making plans for
their marriage or for buying a home.  People are still planning for retirement.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>All of this is still going on because the world is in
darkness.  This is a simple reason, but this is the true reason.  The world is
blind and cannot see these things, and this is not going to change.  This is
why the end of the world is going to come upon them suddenly and unexpectedly. 
The Bible refers to this as &ldquo;sudden destruction.&rdquo;  They will be &ldquo;eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,&rdquo; because there has been a complete
ignorance and lack of understanding.  They have a spiritual blindness towards
these things, and so many people will hear about this Day and dismiss this and
ignore it and continue on with their lives until they see it with their
physical eyes.  At that point, it will not take spiritual sight anymore because
they will know that this is so.  At that point, they will know that God was
telling them exactly what He was about to do well in advance of doing it.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Matthew 20:30-34.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou
</i>son of David. And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold
their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou
</i>son of David. And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will
ye that I shall do unto you? They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
So Jesus had compassion <i>on them, </i>and touched their eyes: and immediately
their eyes received sight, and they followed him.  </p>

<p>Again, if God opens your eyes, you will see that where you
thought you were in history, which is that you thought that you had plenty of
time left in your life like another 20-50 years, you will find that you are
right at the edge of the end of your life.  It is like someone who is
blindfolded and playing a game where they are spun around.  They start walking
and everyone is laughing and joking, and yet there is a cliff right in front of
them and they are about to fall off the cliff and perish.  </p>

<p>If you remember, the prophet Elisha had a servant after the
servant Gehazi, because Gehazi was struck with leprosy; and so we read that he
had another servant.  We read about this true historical story in 2 Kings 6. 
This servant is a little fearful because an army has encircled them.  It says
in 2 Kings 6:15-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And
his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered,
Fear not: for they that <i>be </i>with us <i>are </i>more than they that <i>be </i>with
them. And Elisha prayed, and said, JEHOVAH, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he
may see. And JEHOVAH opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold,
the mountain <i>was </i>full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 
</p>

<p>This is just one stage of this story, but God has always
told us, &ldquo;Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&rdquo;  We have
nothing to worry or fear because God is with His people.  </p>

<p>As we share the Gospel, we can see the world with our
physical eyes and sometimes the enemies of God can really multiply and it can
look like there are a lot of them; but really, spiritually, if God gives us
eyes of faith, we understand that there is nothing at all to fear.  God will
protect us.  He will fight for us.  We can have great confidence in this.  </p>

<p>This story continues, though, and we read in 2 Kings 6:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto JEHOVAH, and
said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with
blindness according to the word of Elisha.  </p>

<p>God opens eyes; God closes eyes.  He is the One who makes
blind.  We read earlier of &ldquo;the god of this world&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 4.  You
should really cross out the small letter &ldquo;g&rdquo; and put a capital &ldquo;G&rdquo; there.  This
is referring to the Lord God.  It is &ldquo;the God of this world&rdquo; who has &ldquo;blinded
the minds of them.&rdquo;  God is always the One who blinds.  </p>

<p>So here in 2 Kings 6:18, Elisha is praying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote
them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.  </p>

<p>Then we read in 2 Kings 6:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto them, This <i>is </i>not the way, neither <i>is
</i>this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But
he led them to Samaria.  </p>

<p>Were they struck with physical blindness?  If so, how could
they follow him?  Or were they struck with ignorance?  Were they struck with a
misunderstanding?  They did not know where they were, and so Elisha steps in, &ldquo;Here,
I will lead you exactly where you want to be.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Elisha leads this army of the blind and he leads them
right into Samaria.  The king of Israel becomes very excited and asks Elisha, &ldquo;Shall
I smite <i>them? </i>Shall I smite <i>them?</i>&rdquo;  This is like a gift!  </p>

<p>In those days, war was very hard and difficult.  Here, the
enemy came marching right into their very hands and it would have been a simple
matter to destroy them because they had no idea where they were.  To them, they
could have been taking a leisurely stroll.  They were casually walking around
with a total lack of understanding of the great danger that they were in as
they marched right into the camp of Israel.  </p>

<p>The question for you and for me is where do we think we
are?  Where do you think you are?  What do you think that you are doing?  Where
do you think that you are going?  </p>

<p>The answer for all of us is that we are speeding along like
a bullet train to May 21, 2011, Judgment Day.  If you think that you are going
to Disney World or if you think that you are going to the beach or if you think
that you have some future beyond this date in mind, there is only one thing to
ask yourself, which is, &ldquo;Are you blind?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The answer to this would have to be, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Yes, you do not
understand.  You lack understanding of what God is revealing.  The only way
that you can be content and to continue to live as you do in the manner in
which you are living can only be because you are blind.  This is the only
answer.  </p>

<p>Let us go to another verse.  This is an encouraging verse. 
If you remember, Christ opened up the Bible and read from Isaiah.  We read
about this in Luke 4:17-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The
Spirit of the Lord <i>is </i>upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at
liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And
he closed the book&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what the Gospel is doing today.  It is preaching to
the blind.  It is recovering your sight.  You can see.  You can see.  This is
possible if God so wills.  He can give you sight just like He gave sight to blind
Bartimaeus, and we should approach Him, just like blind Bartimaeus, and cry out
&ldquo;<i>Thou </i>son of David, have mercy on me&rdquo;; and like the Lord asked
Bartimaeus, &ldquo;What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?&rdquo; our answer should be, &ldquo;That
I might see.  That I might understand.  That I might know that my days are
numbered.  That I might realize that I have very few days left.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us look at one last passage.  Jesus opened up the
physical eyes of the blind man, and here we read of Him opening up the eyes of
the spiritually blind.  It says in Luke 24:44-45:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, These <i>are </i>the words which I spake
unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in </i>the prophets, and <i>in </i>the
psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might
understand the scriptures,  </p>

<p>This is what happens when we are given spiritual sight. 
This is what we need at this time when God is opening the Scriptures.  The Word
was sealed and He is opening it up.  </p>

<p>Do you understand?  Do you know that the church age is
over?  Do you know that God has &ldquo;appointed a day, in the which he will judge
the world&rdquo;?  Do you know that Christ was &ldquo;slain from the foundation of the
world&rdquo;?  More than this, not only knowing this in your brain, but do you really
know and understand these things?  </p>

<p>Let us turn to one more verse.  This is a necessary verse. 
We read in Job 28:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <i>is </i>wisdom;
and to depart from evil <i>is </i>understanding.  </p>

<p>If you truly see this, you will not only see this
intellectually, you will turn from sin.  It is repenting and departing from
evil, like the Ninevites.  This is true understanding.  </p>

<p>Let us close.  </p>
