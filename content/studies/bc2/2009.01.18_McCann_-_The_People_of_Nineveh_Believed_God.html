<p>If everyone could turn to Jonah 3.  It goes Amos, Obadiah,
Jonah.  Jonah was a prophet of Israel hundreds of years before Christ came.  We
really do not read much about him elsewhere in the Bible.  There is a reference
in, I think, Kings to him.  But in the book of Jonah, God gives us the account
of an historical event, as He sent this prophet to Nineveh to bring an
incredible message, to bring a message of judgment.  A message, really, that
only contained two elements: time and judgment.  &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown;&rdquo; that was the whole message that Jonah was to bring to Nineveh. 

</p>

<p>We know when the Lord first sent him that he ran away.  He
got on a ship to Tarshish; but then, of course, God&rsquo;s purposes will always be
accomplished.  No one can run away from God or the will of God because He is
sovereign.  He is in control of everything.  Of course, He is the Creator and
He can control the seas, and so He caused a great storm to come and that ship
was tossed.  The mariners, being experienced seamen, knew that the ship would
be broken and they would all drown soon.  Then the account tells us in Jonah 1
that they asked Jonah who he was and who his God was.  Then they find out that
the storm was because of him and the only way to calm the storm was to throw
him overboard into the sea, but they did not want to do that.  They were decent
people and they did not want to throw him overboard, so they rowed hard to see
if they could get out of that storm but they could not.  They had to throw him
into the sea and, immediately, the sea was calm.  </p>

<p>So Jonah was sinking into the sea when God sent a whale, and
the whale came and swallowed him up, just like we read in the Bible; that is
exactly what happened.  Again, we see the incredible council of God as He
controls all creatures and all events, everything in its perfect time and
place, and there was that whale, just as the sea calmed, and he swallowed up
Jonah, and Jonah was in the whale&rsquo;s belly for three days and three nights. 
Then from the whale&rsquo;s belly, he was praying to God.  We know, spiritually, he was
a beautiful picture of the Lord Jesus because Jesus refers to him in the New
Testament, &ldquo;For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale&rsquo;s belly;
so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>After he prays, and, really, Jonah, too, is a beautiful
picture of the faithfulness of Christ while under the wrath of God, not cursing
God, not angry at God, but praying and thanking God. That, of course,
demonstrates and shows Jesus&rsquo; obedience and faithfulness.  Then he was finally
spit out. The whale vomited him out on the shore, which was near the city of Nineveh. 
It was close to the city.  It does not necessarily have to be that he was
vomited out and then walked up the beach and into the gates of Nineveh.  We do
not know how far the city was, but he went from there directly to the city, and
that is what we read in Jonah 3.  </p>

<p>I am going to read the whole chapter.  It is only ten
verses.  It says in Jonah 3:1-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey. And
Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose
from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with
sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and
published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor
drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence
that <i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i><span class="underline">if</span> </i>God will turn and
repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw
their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the
evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it </i>not.  </p>

<p>That is the end of Jonah 3, and there is something in Jonah
3, to me, that is even more incredible than the raging sea being calmed or that
Jonah was swallowed by a whale and then vomited out.  Do you see what I am
seeing here that is so incredible?  What is it that is absolutely amazing in
Jonah 3?  It is unbelievable, we would say.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 4, Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>Period.  That is it!  A single sentence that is eight
English words long.  That was the message that he brought to Nineveh that God
sent him to bring.  </p>

<p>What is even more incredible is verse 5, Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>Eight words.  Eight words!  That is it!  No more.  It is
true that God sometimes takes, we would say, snapshots out of historical events
and He gives us just, sometimes, bare information.  </p>

<p>So did Jonah go into the city repeating this as he went?  He
could have.  He could have walked a few blocks and said, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and
Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo; and kept walking, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown,&rdquo; but God does not tell us that he did that.  He only tells
us that he said it and He only tells us that he said it once, so we would
really be speculating.  </p>

<p>Could he have added more information?  Maybe.  He could have
said, &ldquo;The Lord has sent me,&rdquo; possibly, but we do not know any of that.  That
is all speculation and, therefore, it could be untrue.  Maybe that did not
happen.  Maybe.  </p>

<p>I would say that this is all we have to go on, so this is
how we have to understand it.  He went into the city of Nineveh, which was a
great city of that day.  We know from the next chapter that there were 120,000
people, at least.  He spoke a single sentence that God had given him to speak
and they all believed him, from the king on down.  The king sat in sackcloth
and he decreed that everyone do so, and the whole city then began to repent. 
They did repent.  They turned from their sins.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 12:41:  </p>

<p class="verse">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation&hellip;</p>

<p>This means that they are going to be resurrected unto life. 
They were saved.  </p>

<p class="verse">The men of Nineveh shall <span class="underline">rise</span> in judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas <i>is </i>here.</p>

<p>So they were saved.  They repented and they are going to be
resurrected on May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011 and they are going to, in their
resurrection, condemn all of those who are left behind or all of the unsaved of
the world, along with the Queen of Sheba and along with all of the others who
are being raised up to life.  </p>

<p>So God makes it very clear, as He gives us more information
in the New Testament, that this single sentence that He gave the prophet to
bring to the people of Nineveh brought about great salvation, tremendous
salvation.  And I think that it is incredible, because men are spiritually dead
men, of themselves.  If you are dead, you do not have eyes to see, you do not
have ears to hear, you do not have any life, and yet God brought the message
and then He saved a great many people in the city.  </p>

<p>Now, why don&rsquo;t we look at this from the world&rsquo;s perspective. 
Let us look at this from man&rsquo;s perspective.  If we are saved, we have been in
the world.  We know how the world thinks.  And here you have a man who is a
stranger, number one.  He was not an Assyrian.  The Ninevites were Assyrians. 
He was not from their nation.  He was not from their city.  He did not
naturally speak their language.  He was a foreigner and a stranger.  It was not
like he had lived there for forty years; he just showed up.  He not only was
from another nation, but he was someone who just appeared on the scene.  As far
as we know, they did not know him at all.  They did not know who he was.  The
men on the ship did not know him, &ldquo;Who are you?  What is your occupation?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I
am a Hebrew and I fear Jehovah.&rdquo;  It is interesting that when he said this, it
says in Jonah 1:8-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause
this evil <i>is </i>upon us; What <i>is </i>thine occupation? and whence comest
thou? what <i>is </i>thy country? and of what people <i>art </i>thou? And he
said unto them, I <i>am </i>an Hebrew; and I fear JEHOVAH, the God of heaven,
which hath made the sea and the dry <i>land</i>. Then were the men exceedingly
afraid&hellip;</p>

<p>You see, there is an association with truth because the
world knows.  The world knows that the Bible is true.  The world knows that Christianity
is the truth.  Deep-down, I think, the world knows this, and so Jonah had the
right association.  He was a Hebrew&mdash;that is, the Old Testament people of
God&mdash;and he feared Jehovah who is the only God, the true God.  He had the right
God and he was identified with the truth, in that sense, and so the men
feared.  </p>

<p>Now, as this Hebrew entered into the Ninevite city, into Nineveh,
he also would have had that same association, because he is coming with a
message from Jehovah, even though he does not say it.  &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  He does not mention God.  He does not mention Jehovah. 
He does not mention any of that, but he was a Hebrew and, I am sure, people in this
city, some of the people, would have recognized him as a Hebrew and that he
would have had an association with the nation of Israel and the true God, the
Lord Jehovah.  And so he is going into the city and here are people of the
world, they are outside of Israel.  They have no connection with Israel.  </p>

<p>Can you think of any other responses that the Ninevites
could have had, other than the one that they did?  What if you or I or any of
us went to downtown Philadelphia and we said&mdash;well, actually we are doing this
with a tract that tells the people of the world that the Rapture is coming May
21<sup>st</sup> and the end of the world is October 21<sup>st</sup>; we are
just relaying what God has revealed to us through His Word and we are giving a
longer time span&mdash;but if we went downtown and we just cried out a single
sentence, &ldquo;So much time, two years, two years and Philadelphia will be
overthrown!&rdquo;  What kind of reaction would we get?  Or New York?  Or Los Angeles? 
Or London?  Or Paris?  What kind of reaction are we going to get from the people
of the world?  Is it going to be the reaction of the Ninevites, as far as the
city itself and the mayor and the rulers of the city and all the people in the
city?  </p>

<p>No.  God is saving a great multitude, but that is not going
to happen.  That is not going to happen.  That is not going to happen.  What
instead would happen is that it would be laughed at; it would be mocked.  We
can think of so many reasons why you would not believe something like that, but
the Ninevites believed.  They believed it, and that is really what is amazing. 
</p>

<p>This is what got me thinking, &ldquo;What convinced them?&rdquo;  What
convinced these people that this was true and really from God and that they
should act upon it?  It was not the volume of evidence, was it?  Jonah did not
come with an encyclopedia of studies, of teachings that were derived from the
Bible, and lay them at the doorstep of the city of Nineveh and start saying, &ldquo;Look
at all of this information that is coming out of the Bible,&rdquo; which, by the
way&mdash;maybe we cannot approach the number of words in an encyclopedia&mdash;but today,
how much information could we lay at someone&rsquo;s feet?  How much?  A lot.  There
have been books written: <i>The End of the Church Age&hellip;and After</i>, <i>Wheat
and Tares</i>, <i>Time Has an End</i>, <i>We Are Almost There!</i>, <i>To God
be the Glory!</i>, and tracts written and so forth, a lot of information, tons
of information.  But, you know, information is not going to convince anyone. 
This volume of information is not going to convince anyone.  Anyone who is
waiting, &ldquo;Okay, give me another study.  Give me some more information.  Come
on.  Show me some more.  Maybe that will convince me.  We might be almost
persuaded,&rdquo; like King Agrippa, maybe, &ldquo;Almost, Paul, thou persuadest me to be a
 Christian.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; that is as far as man&rsquo;s reasoning with man, or that is
as far as any natural man can come to salvation&mdash;almost.  </p>

<p>Of course, that is a tragic place to be, to come right up to
the doorsteps of the Kingdom of Heaven and to be left outside when the door is
shut.  That is an awful place to be, almost there, almost saved, almost
believed it to where I reacted, to where I did something and I responded, but
not quite.  </p>

<p>This is why it is so incredible and so amazing that God
gives us this example that is very similar to what is going on in our day,
where there is a message of time and judgment.  That is it.  Not the love of
God.  Not the Saviour hanging on the cross.  It was just, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh
shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  Judgment: you have a time and you have a date.  &ldquo;Forty
days from this day that I am entering your city,&rdquo; and it was true and it was
faithful because we know what is in the Bible.  Every Word of God is true and
faithful, and God would have destroyed them in forty days; however, they reacted
and they did respond.  </p>

<p>So that is what I would like to take a look at.  Why?  Why
did they respond this way and why do not so many others respond this way?  Why
do so many people need more and more?  For instance, if you go to the Gospel of
John, in John 1, there is another interesting bit of information.  Beginning in
verse 43, it says in John 1:43-46:  </p>

<p class="verse">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of
  Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come
out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</p>

<p>So he is skeptical.  Nathanael is skeptical.  He is not
gullible.  He is not naï, as some people might say that the Ninevites were
for believing such a thing.  He is a skeptic.  He is like a Doubting Thomas
here, &ldquo;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How is he going to be convinced?  Jesus is going to have to
make him one of the disciples, and then he will have to see miracle after
miracle after miracle for three and a half years before he actually believes
that Jesus is the Messiah.  Is that true or false?  That is false?  No.  No. 
He does not go and be Jesus&rsquo; disciple.  Yes, he was a disciple and he did
follow Jesus, but it did not take three and a half years.  He did not have to
see mighty miracles that Jesus later would do.  What convinced him?  &ldquo;Come and
see,&rdquo; Philip said to him, and then in verse 47, John 1:47-49:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest
thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when
thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto
him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</p>

<p>Wow!  How simple!  How quick!  How fast!  </p>

<p>I remember when we were studying the topic of the end of the
Church Age.  I think it was four or five weeks after we came back from the
conference at Towson that Robert and I were talking, because we were a church
at that time and we had been doing a study since we came back.  I just said to
Robert and he said to me, &ldquo;I am convinced, so let us just disband and cease
being a church.&rdquo;  I remember the day because it was the day after 9/11.  It was
September 12<sup>th</sup>.  We said, &ldquo;Yes, that is it.&rdquo;  Then, of course, it
was only four or five weeks that we had been studying the issue when some
people said, &ldquo;You did not study long enough.  You really have to dig in there. 
Your study was too quick, too fast.  You came to a decision, really, too fast,&rdquo;
and they were offended, and also recently with the doctrines that have been
coming out.  </p>

<p>Over the last few years, I think Robert and I had been
teaching hell as much as anyone when we would teach, that it was eternal
damnation and suffering forever and ever.  I remember doing a series on hell
and just emphasizing and reemphasizing the idea that hell was forever.  Then I
heard that Mr. Camping had begun to see that it was not forever, that you are
actually destroyed forever; you are eternally destroyed.  On October 21<sup>st</sup>,
every bit of you is completely gone.  You are gone forever&mdash;you cease to
exist&mdash;and that goes into eternity.  So I started looking at it, and that was
quick; it was only a couple of weeks.  And some people still are saying to me, &ldquo;You
just believe whatever he says; you just follow a man.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I mean, I am sorry.  I am sorry.  What can you do?  When you
go to the Bible and you see something, even if you did not see it before, if
God opens your eyes and you understand something, then you are obligated, you
are responsible.  You cannot keep following something that is not true.  You
have to change and you have to repent and you have to turn and you have to
believe what the Bible teaches.  </p>

<p>So it was really amazing when I saw this about Nathanael. 
How did Jesus convince Nathanael that He was the Messiah, that He <span class="underline">was</span>
the Son of God?  &ldquo;I saw you under the fig tree.&rdquo;  That is it.  That is it.  It
is the least, the least, we definitely could say, of Jesus&rsquo; mighty works,
without question.  Of course, there is a spiritual meaning there; but still, He
saw him under a fig tree, and that was enough for Nathanael.  Then Jesus says
in verse 50, John 1:50:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than
these.</p>

<p>Of course, Jesus was not amazed, really.  He is just
emphasizing that Nathanael believed like a little child.  He believed like a
little child, like a little boy or a little girl when father or mother is
saying something to them.  He believed it immediately.  He believed it right
away and he acted upon it.  He became one of the disciples of the Lord Jesus,
just like the Ninevites believed.  </p>

<p>Now, please, do not misunderstand.  When we hear something,
we have to check it out, as Robert was saying earlier.  We have to be like the
Bereans and search the Scriptures daily to see if it is so.  But how much
searching are some people going to do?  How much evidence do some people need
before they believe, before they act on what they believe?  </p>

<p>God is calling for action.  He is calling for action.  You
know, to think and agree in your mind, &ldquo;May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, yes, that is
the Rapture.  October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, that is the end of the world. 
Alright, I will go along with that.  It is coming from a reliable source,
someone identified with the true Gospel.  For 50 years, they have been bringing
the Gospel to the world.  I will go along with that.&rdquo;  So you now believe it? 
No, you do not.  No, you do not.  What is belief?  They repented at the
preaching of Jonah.  </p>

<p>If the Ninevites had said, &ldquo;Well, yes, I do not know why,
but the king believes him, others believe him.  In forty days, we will be
destroyed, so let us put on sackcloth.&rdquo;  If they just went along with it and
did it but they did not really believe it, then I do not know if they would
have been saved.  You see, God tells us that belief requires action.  It
requires obedience and repentance.  But the question was why did they believe? 
Why did Nathanael believe so quickly that Jesus was the Messiah?  </p>

<p>If we go to John 10:1-5, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To
him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own
sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep,
he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a
stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the
voice of strangers.</p>

<p>The sheep hear His voice.  Nathanael, of course, heard the
voice of Christ, the Great Shepherd, and immediately recognized it.  It was
confirmed in his heart that this was the Lord.  And the Ninevites heard the
Shepherd&rsquo;s voice.  </p>

<p>Go to Acts 22:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
shouldest know his will&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is being spoken to Saul who became the Apostle Paul.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</p>

<p>You see, that is the elect.  Paul is representing the
elect.  </p>

<p class="verse">The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest&hellip;hear
the voice of his mouth.</p>

<p>It really is as simple as that.  It is as simple as that. 
Why, when you give someone a tract, &ldquo;Does God Love You?,&rdquo; do they open it up? 
They are just drawn to read it and when they read it, they believe it and they
are troubled in their heart and they begin to pray and God saves them.  And
then you give another person the exact same tract, it could even be his twin
brother&mdash;it could be his twin brother, it does not matter, they are so much
alike in the world that you could not tell them apart&mdash;and he takes it and rips
it up and throws it in the trash.  Why?  Because God has chosen one.  &ldquo;Jacob
have I loved, but Esau I hated,&rdquo; and they were twins.  He has chosen one and
not the other, and He has predetermined, predestinated from before the
foundation of the world, that the one will hear His voice.  </p>

<p>By the way, what is going on now in our day?  If we go to
Habakkuk 2:2-3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it
</i>plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision <i>is </i>yet
for an appointed time, but at the end <span class="underline">it</span> shall speak&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rdquo; is better translated &ldquo;He.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<span class="underline">He</span> shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for
it; because <span class="underline">it</span> (He) will surely come, <span class="underline">it</span> (He) will not tarry.            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>

<p>At the end, He will speak, and that is related to God
sealing up the Word till the time of the end, and then He lifts the seals.  </p>

<p>He is not going to speak audibly.  He is not going to give
us further revelation.  He is not going to add to the Bible, because the Bible
is complete.  We have Genesis through Revelation, and you cannot add a word,
but He is going to speak by opening up the Scriptures to the understanding of
His people.  </p>

<p>That is why it says in Mark 13 (again, I will just read one
verse), in verse 11, the last part of the verse, Mark 13:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for
it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>The Holy Ghost is speaking through the truth that is coming
forth out of His Word.  There is a lot of truth coming forth and one of them is
that May 21<sup>st</sup> will be the Rapture; October 21<sup>st</sup> will be
the end of the world, 5 months later.  </p>

<p>This is coming from the Bible.  God had sealed up this
information.  He closed it up to the understanding of everyone, throughout
history, till the time of the end.  Now that we are at the time of the end, He
is opening it up and, in a way, He is speaking and His sheep will hear.  They
will know His voice and they will believe it.  They are going to believe it.  </p>

<p>I think some people really think that believers who are
seeing these things, understanding them, and believing them, I think that they
think, deep-down, that they really do not.  But, actually, God&rsquo;s people believe
God.  </p>

<p>You know, the Ninevites heard one sentence from Jonah, &ldquo;Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,&rdquo; and the next verse says that they
believed Jonah.  Is that true?  What did it say in Jonah 3?  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>They believed God.  It does not say that they believed Jonah. 
He was the one who went into the city.  God did not speak from Heaven.  He
sent, probably, a scraggly prophet.  You have to consider that he just came out
of three days and three nights from a whale&rsquo;s belly.  He was probably a little
disheveled and he could have had an odor about him also.  Really, he was three
days and three nights in a whale&rsquo;s belly.  He was a foreigner who had no place
to go and get cleaned up, as far as we know.  He went into the city and he
declared this to the people, and they believed God.  They believed God.  </p>

<p>You see, God knows.  God knows that His people hear His
voice, even though He uses ordinary, typical human beings to declare it to
others.  So I do not mind, really, if people say, &ldquo;Well, you believe anything
that Mr. Camping says.  You are following a man.&rdquo;  I really do not mind,
because I know that this is the world&rsquo;s reaction.  </p>

<p>When God spoke to Saul on the way to Damascus, he was struck
blind and his whole life was changed; but the others that he was traveling with
did not hear it.  It was as though it thundered.  One heard the voice of God
and the others, right there with him, did not hear.  </p>

<p>That is how it is, and people, really, they are just wasting
time, putting it off, trying to say, &ldquo;No, it is not from God.&rdquo;  &ldquo;It is not from
God,&rdquo; is really what they are saying; and they can keep doing that, but that is
not the response of the Ninevites.  That was not their response.  They believed
God and they repented at the preaching of Jonah.  </p>

<p>Okay.  We will stop here and close with a prayer.  </p>
