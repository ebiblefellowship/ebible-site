<p>Could everyone turn to Nehemiah 3.  After 1<sup>st</sup> and
2<sup>nd</sup> Chronicles comes Ezra, followed by Nehemiah.  I am going to read
beginning in verse 1.  Nehemiah 3:1-32:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the
doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of
Hananeel. And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
builded Zaccur the son of Imri. But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah
build, who <i>also </i>laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof,
the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. And next unto them repaired Meremoth
the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the
son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the
son of Baana. And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
not their necks to the work of their Lord. Moreover the old gate repaired
Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the
beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
bars thereof. And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the
Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor
on this side the river. Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of
the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of <i>one of </i>the
apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall. And next unto
them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.
And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his
house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah. Malchijah the
son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and
the tower of the furnaces. And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh,
the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. The valley gate
repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the
doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits
on the wall unto the dung gate. But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of
Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors
thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. But the gate of the fountain
repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it,
and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king&rsquo;s garden, and unto the
stairs that go down from the city of David. After him repaired Nehemiah the son
of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto <i>the place </i>over
against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the
house of the mighty. After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani.
Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his
part. After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of
the half part of Keilah. And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the
ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the
turning <i>of the wall.</i> After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly
repaired the other piece, from the turning <i>of the wall </i>unto the door of
the house of Eliashib the high priest. After him repaired Meremoth the son of
Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib
even to the end of the house of Eliashib. And after him repaired the priests,
the men of the plain. After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his
house. After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the
house of Azariah unto the turning <i>of the wall, </i>even unto the corner. Palal
the son of Uzai, over against the turning <i>of the wall, </i>and the tower
which lieth out from the king&rsquo;s high house, that <i>was </i>by the court of the
prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh. Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in
Ophel, unto <i>the place </i>over against the water gate toward the east, and
the tower that lieth out. After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over
against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel. From above
the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. After
them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired
also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate. After him
repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph,
another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against
his chamber. After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith&rsquo;s son unto the place of
the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the
going up of the corner. And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep
gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.</p>

<p>We will stop there.  </p>

<p>Remember in verse 1, it started with the sheep gate; the
high priest and his brethren were building the sheep gate.  So God just took us
all the way around the city of Jerusalem in the different sections of the wall,
right back to the sheep gate, to tell us that this represents the construction
of the wall, completely around the city.  </p>

<p>It is very interesting, as we look at this chapter
carefully.  In the building of the wall, we normally say that it was Nehemiah&rsquo;s
wall, and it was.  He was the governor.  He was the one who petitioned the
king, whom he served as a cupbearer, that he might return to Jerusalem in order
to build up the wall, because the Jews were a reproach and in affliction to the
surrounding peoples.  </p>

<p>In that day, there was no security at all if you did not
live in a city or in a place that had a wall around it.  When you read the
Bible, you know why.  There were continual wars going on.  A city or a state
without a wall would be easy pickings from any army that came along: the
Babylonians or the Syrians or the Assyrians.  Anyone could have come along at
any point and just completely destroyed your city.  </p>

<p>So they were very concerned about building the wall, and Nehemiah
returned with the king&rsquo;s blessing, as he did find favor in the sight of the
king.  God gave him that favor.  He came back and he got the inhabitants of the
city of Jerusalem involved in the construction of the wall.  </p>

<p>As you look at the building of the wall, there were some
very main and big projects that were very attractive; we would say that they
were glamorous to some degree.  In the building of the sheep gate, the high
priest himself was out there with his brethren building the sheep gate.  Then we
read of some other projects that maybe were not quite as glamorous, like the
building of the dung gate.  </p>

<p>How would you feel if you were assigned the portion of the
dung gate to build up, if you had to build the gate where all of the refuse and
rubbish and everything from the city would flow out?   Still though, we read
that God includes, as part of the information in the building of the city, that
some groups of people had a more difficult task.  For others, it actually
mentions that they built right by their house; their house was right there. 
They were building part of the wall of Jerusalem, round about, and they could
just step right out of their house and go to their job.  </p>

<p>So it is very interesting how God describes this; and all
the while it is going on, there are adversaries and enemies who want to do
nothing but stop the work.  They want the work to cease.  They do not, in any
way, want the wall set up and the gates placed on the wall and this protection
that this provided for the Jews.  And this opposition to the building project
in Jerusalem began almost as soon as they came out of Babylon.  </p>

<p>So in the second year of their coming out of Babylon, they
laid the foundation of the temple and they began to build under the dictate and
the command of Cyrus.  King Cyrus of the Medes and the Persians released them
and commissioned them to return to Jerusalem to build the temple and so they
began.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Ezra, in Ezra 4, this is when they began to
build the temple.  The foundation was already laid.  It says in Ezra 4:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto JEHOVAH God of Israel; Then
they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them,
Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye <i>do; </i>and we do
sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us
up hither. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers
of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto
our God; but we ourselves together will build unto JEHOVAH God of Israel, as
king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. Then the people of the land
weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</p>

<p>Why?  Because they were offended, and that is the nature of
the Gospel.  That is the nature of the Word of God.  &ldquo;If we would allow them,
if we would let them, then we could have all kinds of people who would want to
help with the work; they would want to advance the kingdom; they would want to
share the Gospel with the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Some people fall into this trap and they think, &ldquo;Well, if we
are just more inclusive and bring all of these other Christians together, then
we can really start to work to get the Gospel out to the world and accomplish
God&rsquo;s purpose of sending forth His Word.&rdquo;  However, God does not just let
anybody work in the Gospel.  You have to have the true Gospel, the faithful
Gospel, and these individuals who were placed in the land of Samaria, after
their nation was destroyed due to the Israelite&rsquo;s disobedience, they wanted to
help.  They wanted to work in building the temple, and yet it was made clear to
them, &ldquo;You have nothing to do with us in building the house of God.&rdquo;  We can relate
this to the fact that they were not Jews, which means that, spiritually, they were
not true believers; this is what God is actually teaching. </p>

<p>So these people were offended and began to trouble the work
in whatever way they could.  If you remember what they did do was that they
wrote letters to the king who came after Cyrus, King Artaxerxes.  I am not sure
exactly when this king began to reign, but they wrote a letter.  Actually, God
gave us the very letter that they wrote.  In Ezra 4, they write to the king and
tell the king, &ldquo;If you allow these Jews to build up this rebellious and bad
city, then you will endanger your revenue; you will endanger the taxes that you
collect, because they are notoriously bad.  They are rebels.  Once they get the
city finished, then your taxes will not be gathered.  They will not pay you the
taxes and that might affect other countries, too.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Artaxerxes searched the rolls and he did find out the
history of Jerusalem, that they had made insurrection in the past.  Not only
that, but they were, at one point, a great nation who had other nations serve
them.  So he commanded, &ldquo;Cause the work to cease&rdquo;; the work was to stop.  </p>

<p>So the enemies of the Jews got their wish.  That is what
they wanted.  They wanted the work to stop.  The only thing, it seems, that
makes the enemies of God happy is when the work is halted, when the work is not
continuing.  </p>

<p>So they got this letter from the king and ran up right away
and caused the work on the temple to cease.  It stopped until the second year
of Darius, another king of the Medes and the Persians.  That was the year when
Haggai and Zechariah, the prophets, rose up&mdash;God raised them up and they began
to prophesy&mdash;then the Jews began to work again.  </p>

<p>Really, if you read the books of Haggai and Zechariah, they
begin with the second year of Darius.  Those books are very much connected to
what we read in Ezra and Nehemiah.  </p>

<p>So they began to build the temple in the second year.  In
Darius&rsquo; sixth year, they completed the temple, which was years after they had
come out of Babylon.  So the temple was completed, but the temple was nothing
like Solomon&rsquo;s temple.  It was standing&mdash;it was constructed and it was a very
nice structure&mdash;but it was nothing in comparison to the great temple that
Solomon built.  Yet all around the temple, there was open access because the
walls had not been established; they had not been put up.  Jerusalem continued
on in this condition for many more years until we find in the book of Nehemiah
that Nehemiah hears this report.  </p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t we go there.  In Nehemiah 1:1-3, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass
in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the twentieth year of the king that he was serving
as cupbearer to.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;as I was in Shushan the palace, That Hanani, one of my
brethren, came, he and <i>certain </i>men of Judah; and I asked them concerning
the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning
Jerusalem. And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
there in the province <i>are </i>in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem
also <i>is </i>broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>

<p>You see, this was a troubling situation, a very troubling
situation, and Nehemiah began to mourn it says in verse 4.  He fasted and
prayed to God for the courage to say something to the king that he served.  </p>

<p>At one point, the king notices that he is cast down or
looking sorrowful and he asks him, &ldquo;What is the matter, you are not sick?&rdquo;  He
had never seen Nehemiah in this kind of situation before.  Then Nehemiah makes
a request of the king and the king grants him his request, in all probability
because Nehemiah was a very, very faithful servant to the king.  </p>

<p>You know, whoever your cupbearer is, he is someone in whom
you really have to trust.  He is the one in charge of making sure that you do
not get poisoned.  If you did not trust your cupbearer, you might tremble
whenever you took a drink because it was very common for kings to be
assassinated.   So to be in that position, Nehemiah was a very trusted servant
who had served the king well and now there was an opportunity to make a request
of this king, which he did.  The king granted his request and Nehemiah returned
to Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>It is interesting in Nehemiah 2, concerning the surrounding
people, that it says in Nehemiah 2:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard <i>it</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>They had heard that Nehemiah came to help the Jews as
governor.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What <i>is

</i>this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?  </p>

<p>They are using the same tactics as the previous generation
who caused the work to cease.</p>

<p>Then it says in verse 20, Nehemiah 2:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he
will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no
portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>It is saying the same thing that Zerubbabel and Jeshua told
the other group, &ldquo;You cannot be a part of this work.  You cannot build the
house of God.&rdquo;  Here he is telling them, &ldquo;You have no portion.  This has
nothing to do with you.  This is a work in service to God, the true God.  All
who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth, and you have all kinds
of ideas about the Gospel that are false.&rdquo;  So they had no part in it.  </p>

<p>But it did not stop.  We read in chapter 3 that these
sections were being repaired by certain groups of individuals and people.  Then
in Nehemiah 4:1-8, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.  And
he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these
feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make
an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish
which are burned? Now Tobiah the Ammonite <i>was </i>by him, and he said, Even
that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone
wall. Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their
own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: And cover not
their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they
have provoked <i>thee </i>to anger before the builders. So built we the wall;
and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had
a mind to work. But it came to pass, <i>that </i>when Sanballat, and Tobiah,
and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls
of Jerusalem were made up, <i>and </i>that the breaches began to be stopped,
then they were very wroth, And conspired all of them together to come <i>and </i>to
fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</p>

<p>You see, that is the key.  That is the purpose that the
Gospel always is confronted with: the opposition of the enemy who wants to stop
it, at all costs, if possible.  And if they cannot stop it, &ldquo;Let me slow it
down; let me hinder it; let me just be troublesome enough that it is not going
to go as it should.&rdquo;  A common tactic of the enemies of God&rsquo;s people is to
attack the Gospel.  </p>

<p>You know, God sets up a Biblical principle in 1 Corinthians
16:9, where it says:   </p>

<p class="verse">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i>there
are </i>many adversaries.  </p>

<p>They go hand in hand.  When you have a great door that is a
wide open door and effectual, or powerful; that is, God&rsquo;s Word is quick and
powerful and it can go forth through this door, this opportunity that has
arrived can save many people.  In our day, it is a great multitude of people.  However,
whenever this kind of situation comes up, there are always many adversaries&mdash;not
a few&mdash;but many adversaries who want to stop the work of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>You know, when we are looking at the wall that Nehemiah was
in charge of erecting and in charge of building, that wall has everything to do
with the Gospel.  This is why God took so much care and used so many Scriptures
in these books to explain this, to lay it all out that this wall is related to
the Gospel, and not only the Gospel but to a very important aspect of the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>If we go to Isaiah 26 [<i>note: the speaker inadvertently
said Jeremiah 26</i>], it says in Isaiah 26:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have
a strong city&hellip;  </p>

<p>By the way, the word &ldquo;repaired&rdquo; that is used thirty-five
times in Nehemiah 3 is even used more often as &ldquo;strength&rdquo; or &ldquo;strengthened,&rdquo;

the idea of strength or being strong because the wall is weak.  In some places,
they had to build it because it was completely gone.  In other places, it was
probably knocked down and yet there were still a few stones.  </p>

<p>This is not the time yet when there will not be one stone
left upon another, so there could have been a few stones, as the Babylonians did
destroy the wall and the city. But they are repairing the wall and making it
strong; they are fortifying it.  It is going to be a place of safety because of
the strength of the walls.  </p>

<p>Isaiah 26:1 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;We have a strong city; salvation will <i>God </i>appoint <i>for
</i>walls and bulwarks.</p>

<p>Here God is connecting the idea of salvation and a strong
wall.  </p>

<p>Also go to Isaiah 60:18.  It says in the last part of Isaiah
60:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.</p>

<p>So this is another reference where God is likening the walls
to salvation.  This is very important because if we go to 2 Chronicles
36:18-19, once the Babylonians had overcome the city, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
the treasures of the house of JEHOVAH, and the treasures of the king, and of
his princes; all <i>these </i>he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the house
of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof
with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</p>

<p>So the Babylonians destroyed the city&mdash;we know that this was
in 587 B.C.&mdash;and they broke down the wall.  </p>

<p>Now, spiritually, the Jews, Israel, and Jerusalem typify the
churches and congregations, but Jerusalem could also typify the elect.  There
are two things that Jerusalem could typify, at least.  It could represent the
elect or it could represent the corporate body, the outward representation of
the Kingdom of God on earth, yet here God also has identified the walls as
relating to salvation.  So there is no way that the walls of Jerusalem, in this
case, when they are broken down, could relate to the elect of God or to that
heavenly Jerusalem; because once God&rsquo;s people are saved, they are always saved
and can never lose their salvation.  Therefore, it has to be the representation
of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, the corporate body, the churches and congregations of the
world.  We know that when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, it is
connected to our present day of Great Tribulation when Satan is loosed and he
is coming against the churches and congregations.  </p>

<p>So here is a verse where God is telling us&mdash;and there are a
few like this&mdash;that once Jerusalem is overcome by Babylon, which is pointing to
the church and Satan overcoming the church, there will no longer be a wall,
there will no longer be salvation in the midst of the church.  It is
impossible.  The wall is gone; it is destroyed.  There is no more salvation.  </p>

<p>There is also another passage that relates to this in Joshua
6 at the battle of Jericho.  In the first few verses, the Lord explains that Jericho
was shut up.  The Israelites had compassed them around, then God gave them the
plan of action or the battle plan, &ldquo;You are to go around the city once a day
for six days.  Then on the seventh day, you are to encircle the city seven
times.&rdquo;  Following the seventh time around, or the 13<sup>th</sup> time around,
here is what did happen and what God explained would happen, in Joshua 6:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people shouted when <i>the priests </i>blew with the
trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so
that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they
took the city.</p>

<p>Jericho is another group of people who typify the corporate
church.  Jericho was part of the promised land that Moses was privileged to see
before he died.  God included that, and you can read about it in Deuteronomy
34.  Jericho was included in the promise to Abraham, so it represents the
corporate body.  It is more than that, but it definitely represents the
churches and congregations of the world.  After the 13 times around, on the 13<sup>th</sup>
time or following that 13<sup>th</sup> time, the wall falls.  </p>

<p>It is kind of strange that God would do it that way.  You
know, there are how many ways to sack a city?  There are many, many ways to
sack a city, but He decided to have them circle it 13 times.  Following the 13<sup>th</sup>

time, the wall falls down.  We can see how important a wall is because
following the destruction of the wall, Israel just walks right into the city
and destroys every man, woman, and child, except for Rahab and her family.  </p>

<p>God is telling us, spiritually, that this will happen after
13,000 years of history, and it is amazing that it just so happens that in May
of 1988 when the Church Age came to an end, it coincided with the earth&rsquo;s
13,000<sup>th</sup> year of existence exactly.  </p>

<p>What does it mean that the Church Age came to an end?  God
was finished using them, the Holy Spirit came out of the midst, and no more
would they have salvation from that point until the end of the world, just like
when God was finished using Israel, the nation of Israel.  Once Christ came, He
removed the blessing that had been upon that people, as they were the corporate
representation of God.  He removed it on that day.  In 33 A.D., the veil of the
temple was rent and never again, up until today and till the end of the world,
could anyone ever be saved in a synagogue or within that religion.  It became a
false religion, a false gospel.  There is no one being saved in Judaism, just
as there is no one being saved in any church in the world since May of 1988. 
We can get more exact&mdash;but I always forget the day before, the day of, so you
can check this out further if you would like&mdash;but it was Pentecost in 1988 when
the Church Age came to an end or right around there.  That was the day when the
Holy Spirit left and the wall fell down.  </p>

<p>Yes, you can find churches everywhere and they still have
walls.  The Presbyterian Church or the Catholic Church, they have buildings;
they have walls that are integral parts of their buildings.  God is not saying
that, but what happened spiritually was that the wall fell down, which God equates
to salvation being removed.  Yet it is not the end of salvation or the end of
hope because, in Joshua 6, the Lord uses language of the Jubilee.  It was not
long after 1988, in 1994, when God began to evangelize the world during this
time of the second Jubilee period or the second outpouring of the Holy Spirit
when He is going to save that great multitude.  It is not the end of salvation,
but it is the end of salvation within the outward representation, within the
churches and congregations of the world.  </p>

<p>So we can see why God gives so much time or so many
Scriptures to an apparent building project of a wall.  He gave a whole chapter,
thirty something verses, of all of these individuals who were working hard to
build this wall.  They did a very magnificent job, did they not?  </p>

<p>How long did it take them to finish the wall?  Let me ask a
Bible trivia question.  True or False?  The wall was built in 52 weeks.  No, 52
days, not 52 weeks.  We see this in Nehemiah 6:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day </i>of <i>the
month </i>Elul, in fifty and two days.</p>

<p>Fifty-two days.  That was very fast.  They did not have
construction equipment like we have today, and they were probably better off. 
You know, the guys get out their construction equipment and sometimes they just
stand around it seems.  But they had humble tools, good tools, and yet they did
not have any of the machinery that is available today.  What they did have was
a mind to work.  God tells us this is Nehemiah 4.  The people had a mind to
work.  They were not lazy.  </p>

<p>There is a historical aspect to this; they actually did
physical work.  They were building the wall.  They each took their section,
their assigned patch, their portion of the wall, and they went to work.  The
high priest, Eliashib, was actually working on the wall.  Of course, we know
that, spiritually, that points to Jesus who is the Great High Priest of His
people.  </p>

<p>Did Christ work in building up the wall?  Yes.  Yes, of
course, He is the foundation, to begin with.  He was laboring night and day
during His time of ministry, going around healing the sick and teaching and
preaching the Gospel.  Christ really gave us an excellent example of what it is
to work within the Gospel, to work to get the Gospel out to the people of the
world.  </p>

<p>Now, let us not think too highly of Eliashib, though.  He did
a good thing in working on the wall with his brethren.  But later on, he is
also someone who goes astray and allows (I think it was) Sanballat to have
access into the temple.  </p>

<p>But here in this picture, in Nehemiah 3, God is using him as
a type and a figure, I think, of Christ.  It is the sheep gate that Eliashib
and his brethren are building.  They are putting together the sheep gate, which
means that once the gate is up, the sheep will come through that particular
entrance.  Of course, Jesus is the Great Shepherd who saves His sheep and leads
them on, so we can see how this ties in.  </p>

<p>There were ten gates described in Nehemiah 3.  There were
various gates.  There was the sheep gate, the fish gate, the fountain gate, the
water gate, the dung gate.  There was the horse gate, the east gate, the gate
Miphkad, which is a Hebrew word that is transliterated.  It actually means or
could mean &ldquo;appointed&rdquo; or &ldquo;number&rdquo; or &ldquo;commandment.&rdquo;  So there are these ten
gates, which are very important to the wall itself.  They are part of the
construction of the wall.  It is through these gates that entry would be made
of certain animals.  The people would use these gates for various reasons.  We
also mentioned earlier the dung gate.  Yet they were all a part of the wall.  </p>

<p>The Lord refers to gates, if you remember, in Revelation. 
In Revelation 21, which is referring to the heavenly Jerusalem or the body of
believers, they are viewed here as coming down out of Heaven, and it says in
Revelation 21:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And had a wall great and high, <i>and </i>had twelve gates, and
at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are <i>the names </i>of
the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</p>

<p>Also in verse 25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
shall be no night there.</p>

<p>That is the Jerusalem that is soon to come, May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011, Heaven itself, when all the believers will enter into the gate
and forever be with the Lord.  And that gate will never close because it is
always like day; there is never night.  They would close the gates if there
were nights, but there is never a night.  So they are eternally opened, but
only for the redeemed of the Lord to enter in and go forth in and out.  It will
be for no one else.  </p>

<p>If you look over in Revelation 22, Jesus refers to Himself
as Alpha and Omega, and it says in Revelation 22:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>are </i>they that do his commandments, that they may
have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the
city.</p>

<p>So we have to do His commandments in order to enter into the
city, but nobody can do His commandments.  &ldquo;If you love Me, keep My
commandments.&rdquo;  God tells us that this is an evidence of salvation, if we are
finding in our lives a desire and an ability to perform the doing of it in
keeping His commandments, that this is just simply evidence that we are saved
and that He has given us that new heart and spirit.  In Ezekiel 36, God says
that when He gives us that heart, He will enable us to do His statutes or to
obey Him and to do His will, and so we can then have access into Heaven
itself.  </p>

<p>If everyone could turn to Psalm 118:19-20, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, <i>and
</i>I will praise JEHOVAH: This gate of JEHOVAH, into which the righteous shall
enter.</p>

<p>You see, that is the gate of righteousness.  It is Christ&rsquo;s
gate.  He is righteousness.  We must go through Him.  He is the way, the life. 
We have to enter into the heavenly Jerusalem only through the Lord Jesus
Christ.  There is no other way.  </p>

<p>Remember in Joel, they try to climb up some other way
because the gate is shut.  People try this all the time, and have been trying
it, and nobody has ever made it yet.  All the thieves and the robbers are all
locked out of the Kingdom.  They will not be able to enter into the city.  </p>

<p>So here in Nehemiah, we are just getting this overview of
how important the construction of the wall of Jerusalem is.  Nehemiah
accomplishes it; he is able to build it.  Yes, he gets the credit, but there
were many people involved.  Just like Jesus, of course, is building His
Kingdom, but all of God&rsquo;s people are involved in the construction of the
heavenly Kingdom or the New Jerusalem because we are built up.  As individuals
become saved, they are like living stones that are put together as God makes up
His spiritual house or wall or city.  It is all saying the same thing but just
using different types of language.  </p>

<p>So we find these gates were here, but, you know, it is
interesting what we read in Nehemiah 3:5.  We read this earlier, but this
stands out.  This really stands out, because it seems to be the only negative
in the whole chapter.  In Nehemiah 3:5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
not their necks to the work of their Lord.  </p>

<p>This is understandable with men.  This is very
understandable, is it not?  If you are a nobleman, if you are in a position of
honor and power and authority?  This word &ldquo;noble&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;famous&rdquo; in
some places.  You are a prince perhaps.  You are someone who has a line within Israel
that the people highly respect, so you put your men to work, &ldquo;Okay, I will give
you our servants, our fellow Tekoites.  Go ahead; we are allowing you to put
them to work on the wall.  But we ourselves, we just had our nails manicured
and we do not want to get dirt under them.  We ourselves will not put our necks
out.  We are not going to stretch our necks out in laboring upon this wall.  No
way; no way.  Just give us reports of how it is going and we will rejoice with
you when it is finished.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Is that not arrogant?  The high priest was out there.  Other
priests were out there.  They had rulers of the half part of Jerusalem out
there with shovels and pickaxes, or whatever they had, doing the work. 
Nehemiah certainly was heavily involved in doing this work and he was the
governor himself, and yet we had some noblemen, you know, with that idea of the
nose up in the air, like a snob.  I think this idea comes from Scripture like
this, noblemen who would not put forth effort in order to do work &ldquo;of their
Lord&rdquo; it says.  For the Lord&rsquo;s work, they would not put forth effort.  </p>

<p>Surprisingly, there is a verse that relates to this in
Romans.  In Romans 16, where it speaks of Priscilla and Aquila, in Romans 16:3-4: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: Who have
for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but
also all the churches of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>They put their necks to the work.  They laid down their necks. 
Do you know that idiomatic expression that we have in the English language?  &ldquo;I
am sticking my neck out for you.&rdquo;  Don&rsquo;t we have that?  It means basically the
same thing as what the Bible says.  It probably, more than likely, came from
the Bible.  &ldquo;I am going to stick my neck out for you because I have a good
feeling about you.&rdquo;  People say this when they refer someone to be hired for a
job.  You know, their reputation is on the line, too.  If that person does
badly, it reflects on them, &ldquo;I am going to risk myself for you.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Here, God is indicating that Priscilla and Aquila did this. 
They did this and it could have been their very life, because in those days, it
was not an easy thing to be a Christian.  There was much persecution, even unto
death; they could lose their head, like John the Baptist, or suffer in many
other ways.  </p>

<p>So I think that this helps us to understand what is being
said in Nehemiah about these noblemen, &ldquo;They put not their necks to the work.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Or let us go to 2 Thessalonians 3, where it tells us of
people who have problems with working.  We would say that they are lazy.  In 2
Thessalonians 3:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
not ourselves disorderly among you; Neither did we eat any man&rsquo;s bread for
nought; but wrought&hellip;  </p>

<p>And that means &ldquo;worked.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
chargeable to any of you:  </p>

<p>Now, a little further on in Nehemiah, when the heat is
turned up and the opposition becomes even greater from the adversaries, they
begin to labor from the morning sun until the stars appear.  They are holding
swords in one hand, it says, and a shovel in the other (that may not be an
exact quote) because there is danger involved.  They do not even take their
clothes off, except to wash.  They are so concentrated and the effort being put
forth is so diligent that it is affecting other areas of their lives.  All they
can think of is, &ldquo;I must build this section of the wall, no matter how small of
a section.  It might be right out in front of my house, but I must build up the
wall of Jerusalem.  This is the work of the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We need to keep in mind that this wall represented
salvation.  The only way that someone can become saved is through hearing the
Gospel.  The only way that someone can hear the Gospel is if someone brings
them the Gospel.  That is spiritual work.  If that work is not performed, then
the nobleman did not do it but others did.  Others did do the work and God
tells us that they had a mind to work.  So, too, will every one of God&rsquo;s people
have that mind, especially today.  Especially in our day, there will be
individuals thinking about getting the Gospel out in whatever way they can.  </p>

<p>Let us read on here.  2 Thessalonians 3:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample
unto you to follow us. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you,
that if any would not work, neither should he eat. For we hear that there are
some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</p>

<p>And then it goes on.  So we can see that God&rsquo;s law, His
commandment is to work.  Whatever you do, do it heartily as to the Lord. 
Work.  Yes, we work at our jobs.  Yes, we do what we have to do in this world;
but spiritually, it has to do with ministering the Gospel.  </p>

<p>We are running out of time, so let us just go back and look
at one other thing.  Nehemiah 6:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <i>that
</i>there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the
doors upon the gates;) </p>

<p>So God is telling us that they worked on the wall first
while the others were working on the gates, but not at the very place that they
would set them up.  They were probably laid on the ground somewhere while they
were putting on the doors and the locks and the bars of the gates for each of
the ten gates that are mentioned in Nehemiah 3.  There could have been other
gates, or maybe different names for the gates, because in Nehemiah it also
speaks about a gate of Ephraim that we did not find in Nehemiah 3.  But anyway,
they were working on the gates and others were working on sections of the wall
and they completed the wall all the way around the city.  The only thing left
to do was to hang the gates, to put up the doors on the gates.  </p>

<p>Why is that interesting?  Well, because it took 52 days to
do this and we know that the number 52 reminds us of 52 weeks (which is why
some people got that trivia question wrong) because there are 52 weeks in a
year.  God is using the number 52 in a very similar way like He used 365 with
Enoch.  After 365 years of Enoch&rsquo;s life, he was taken up; he was raptured.  </p>

<p>After the acceptable year of the Lord&mdash;that is, the Gospel
going forth into the world&mdash;comes the Rapture on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  We can relate 52 days to 52 weeks in a year, because God does this kind of thing
constantly in the Bible.  And after a year, the acceptable year of the Lord,
the wall was completely finished.  </p>

<p>But now we find out that they had worked on the wall itself. 
Then the last thing that they did was to put up the gates, and the last gate
would have been put up on the 52<sup>nd</sup> day.  Once they put up that last
gate and they secured it, they brought safety to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and they locked out all the enemies.  The gate was completed; the doorway, we
could say, was closed on the 52<sup>nd</sup> day.  After the acceptable year of
the Lord on May21st, 2011, God is going to shut the door.  </p>

<p>If we go to Luke 13:24, I think that we will see a
connection, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p>

<p>There is that heavenly city.  There is the gate.  It is a
narrow way, we find in Matthew 7.  It is not a broad gate.  It is not a wide
open gate that leads to Heaven&mdash;that would lead to destruction&mdash;but it is a
straight gate, a very narrow gate that only God can bring someone through,
because only God can save a sinner and bring someone into His Kingdom.  </p>

<p>Here, the Lord is encouraging all people to strive, just
like you would in a fight; strive to win; strive to make it.  Do your best to
enter in to the Kingdom of God, even though we know that there is nothing that
we can do, as a person, to enter in.  Ultimately, it is all a result of the
mercy and grace of God and His salvation plan as to whom He will save and bring
into His Kingdom.  </p>

<p>But then it says in Luke 13:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying,
Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not
whence ye are:</p>

<p>That would be at the end of the acceptable year of the Lord,
May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  </p>

<p>Well, there is a lot of information in Nehemiah, in that
chapter and in the following chapters, so maybe we will take another look at this
at another time.  Why do we not stop here and close with a word of prayer.  </p>
