<p>Chris touched on Psalm 46 and how this applies to what we
are seeing now as God continues to open up His Word to His people and as He
continues to give us the assurance that we have the truth and that we are on
the right track.  We will go through this Psalm and look at a number of words
and phrases in this Psalm that have to do with what is going to happen on May
21<sup>st</sup>.  </p>

<p>We now have a study on Friday nights at Palmyra, NJ.  During
last week&rsquo;s study, we looked at Proverbs 22:17-21.  Let us just read this
before we go to Psalm 46.  We read in Proverbs 22:17-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The words of the wise&rdquo; are this Book.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
thine heart unto my knowledge. For <i>it is </i>a pleasant thing if thou keep
them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. That thy trust may
be in JEHOVAH, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. Have not I
written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, That I might make
thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the
words of truth to them that send unto thee?  </p>

<p>This is how it works.  God opens up His Word to His people. 
We get our assurance of salvation and of truth from His Word.  We are then
commissioned to take this Word to others.  This is the way that this works.  </p>

<p>There is one more verse before we look at Psalm 46.  We read
in 2 Timothy 2:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
Jesus.  </p>

<p>Then 2 Timothy 2:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.  </p>

<p>This will go right to the end.  This applies to any true
believer to whom God is opening up His Word.  </p>

<p>Let us now read Psalm 46.  It says in Psalm 46:1-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon
Alamoth. God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the
mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<i> Though </i>the waters
thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof. Selah.<i> There is </i>a river, the streams whereof shall
make glad the city of God, the holy <i>place </i>of the tabernacles of the most
High. God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
her, <i>and that </i>right early. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved:
he uttered his voice, the earth melted. JEHOVAH of hosts <i>is </i>with us; the
God of Jacob <i>is </i>our refuge. Selah. Come, behold the works of JEHOVAH,
what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the
end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he
burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still, and know that I <i>am </i>God: I
will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. JEHOVAH of
hosts <i>is </i>with us; the God of Jacob <i>is </i>our refuge. Selah.  </p>

<p>The introduction to this Psalm that is before verse 1 is
part of this Psalm.  God inspired for this to be written as part of this
Psalm.  It says in Psalm 46:1 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the <span class="underline">chief Musician</span> for the sons of Korah, A Song upon
Alamoth&hellip; </p>

<p>This word that was translated as &ldquo;chief Musician&rdquo; is a word
that means &ldquo;to excel,&rdquo; &ldquo;to lead,&rdquo; &ldquo;to oversee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;to set forward.&rdquo;  This
would be speaking of the chief of the musicians.  Often when there was an event
in Jerusalem, the musicians among the Levites who were skilled would praise God
in music.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Chronicles 15.  David is preparing a place for the
ark.  Musicians are gathered and are playing, and we read in 1 Chronicles
15:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith <span class="underline">to excel</span>.  </p>

<p>This is the same word as &ldquo;chief.&rdquo;  &ldquo;To excel&rdquo; can also mean &ldquo;to
oversee.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Sheminith&rdquo; means &ldquo;eight,&rdquo; so this must have been some kind of
eight-stringed instrument.  </p>

<p>1 Chronicles 25 says this more plainly.  We read in 1
Chronicles 25:1-3:</p>

<p class="verse">Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should
prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the
workmen according to their service was: Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and
Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of
Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king. Of Jeduthun: the
sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah,
six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to
give thanks and to praise JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>So prophesying with a musical instrument is part of
declaring the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Again, Psalm 46:1 starts out:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who is the &ldquo;chief Musician&rdquo;?  Spiritually, this would be
referring to Christ.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 22.  Psalm 22 is probably the most Messianic
of the Psalms.  We can see Christ on the cross all through this Psalm.  Psalm
22:20-21 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
dog. Save me from the lion&rsquo;s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of
the unicorns.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 22:22 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee.  </p>

<p>Christ is spiritually, and always has been, among His
people.  There are verses that you can find in the Bible that say that God
dwells with His people.  Christ is praising God among us.  When we read here of
the &ldquo;chief Musician,&rdquo; I really believe that we can spiritually see Christ as
the &ldquo;chief Musician&rdquo;; because, again, these musicians praised God.  </p>

<p>So Psalm 46:1 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah&hellip;  </p>

<p>If we go to Numbers 16, we will read of a rebellion in the
wilderness by Dathan and Abiram.  Numbers 16:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi&hellip;  </p>

<p>So Kohath was a Levite.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of
Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <i>men:</i> And they rose up before Moses&hellip;  </p>

<p>These men were rebelling against Moses.  They were
questioning his authority, and so God commanded Moses to assemble everyone on a
certain day.  The earth swallowed up these men and their families.  In this,
God was showing whom He had sanctified to come near to Him, which were the sons
of Aaron and the Levites.  God was showing that these men were in rebellion in
what they were doing.  </p>

<p>If we go to a passage in Numbers 26, we read something interesting. 
It says in Numbers 26:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and
fifty men: and they became a sign.  </p>

<p>This was a spiritual sign and we are to see judgment in
this, but this is another study in and of itself.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 11, Numbers 26:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.  </p>

<p>God consumed the children of these other men.  He consumed
their whole families.  </p>

<p>So I believe that we are to see God&rsquo;s mercy in this.  These
were His people, these Levites who were set apart from the other tribes of Israel
to serve the Lord; but yet God spared the sons of Korah.  I do not think that
there is any other Korah that we can find in the Bible; and so in Psalm 46:1,
this would have to be speaking of the sons or the descendants of that man
Korah.  I believe that we are to see God&rsquo;s mercy in this in that these men were
spared and were serving God.  </p>

<p>So Psalm 46:1 starts out again:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;A Song upon <span class="underline">Alamoth</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;alamoth&rdquo; is the plural form of the word &ldquo;virgin.&rdquo; 
This would probably be &ldquo;A Song [<i>for</i>] Alamoth,&rdquo; because most of these
prepositions can be translated into different English words; and so I believe
that this would be saying that this was &ldquo;A Song [<i>for</i>] Alamoth&rdquo; or for the
virgins.  All true believers are virgins.  We understand this.  </p>

<p>If we go to the Song of Solomon, we will also see this
word.  The Song of Solomon is an exchange between Christ and His Bride, the
elect.  This is like an exchange of love, and it starts out in Song of Solomon
1:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">The song of songs, which <i>is </i>Solomon&rsquo;s. Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love <i>is </i>better than wine. Because
of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <i>is as </i>ointment poured
forth, therefore do the <span class="underline">virgins</span> love thee.  </p>

<p>This is that same word as &ldquo;alamoth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at 2 Corinthians 11, which is where we will find this
principle.  Any child of God who has been washed by the water of the Word in
salvation is chaste and pure before God.  In 2 Corinthians 11:2, the Apostle
Paul, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am jealous over you&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is Paul speaking and he is saying that he is jealous
over the church at Corinth.  Paul, very often, is a figure of Christ, and so he
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i>you as </i>a chaste virgin
to Christ.  </p>

<p>This is the principle of what we are seeing in the
introduction to Psalm 46.  We read again in Psalm 46:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon [<i>or
for</i>] Alamoth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is really what all the Psalms are for.  They are for
God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>So Psalm 46:1 starts out:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble.  </p>

<p>Turn to Jeremiah 17 and we will look at this word &ldquo;refuge&rdquo;
to see what this is talking about.  Jeremiah 17:13-17 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">O JEHOVAH, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
ashamed, <i>and </i>they that depart from me shall be written in the earth,
because they have forsaken JEHOVAH, the fountain of living waters. Heal me, O
JEHOVAH, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou <i>art </i>my
praise. Behold, they say unto me, Where <i>is </i>the word of JEHOVAH? let it
come now. As for me, I have not hastened from <i>being </i>a pastor to follow
thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out
of my lips was <i>right </i>before thee. Be not a terror unto me: thou <i>art </i>my
<span class="underline">hope</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the word &ldquo;refuge.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou <i>art </i>my [<i>refuge</i>] in the day of evil.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;day of evil&rdquo; is referring to the Day of Judgment.  </p>

<p>Look at Ecclesiastes 11:1.  This whole chapter of
Ecclesiastes 11 is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">Cast thy bread upon the waters&hellip;  </p>

<p>This whole chapter is telling us to get the Gospel out.  We
do not know who the elect are, but God will work through this.  We are to get
the Gospel out and &ldquo;cast thy bread upon the waters.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Ecclesiastes 11:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it [<i>or
him</i>] after many days. Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou
knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</p>

<p>We cannot comprehend this judgment.  Even though God is
giving us much information about it, we cannot comprehend it.  </p>

<p>Look at Ecclesiastes 12:1.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>Again, this is speaking of the end.  Actually, this is
speaking of the beginning of the five months and this is also speaking of the
end.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:  </p>

<p>Whenever we read of the sun or the light or the moon or the
stars being darkened, we are reading again of that last day when there will be
no more Gospel, when it ends.  This is the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; that is spoken of in relation
to the &ldquo;day of evil&rdquo; that we read about in Jeremiah.  God will be our refuge
and our help in that day of trouble.  </p>

<p>Again, Psalm 46:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and <span class="underline">strength</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 86.  Let us look at one verse that has to do
with this word &ldquo;strength.&rdquo;  We have no strength in ourselves.  We will see
again how it is God who has done everything to save us.  Our salvation was paid
for before the foundations of the world.  Any gospel that brings any kind of
work and says that we have to do even the slightest thing to bring about
salvation is &ldquo;another Jesus&rdquo; and it is a false gospel.  Psalm 86:16 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy <span class="underline">strength</span>
unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.  </p>

<p>We have no strength in ourselves to save ourselves, as we
read again in Psalm 46:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;found&rdquo; is actually in this verse, and so this
could better be translated:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;very much found to be a <span class="underline">help</span> in trouble.  </p>

<p>We find this word &ldquo;help&rdquo; in Psalm 22.  Psalm 22:19 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But be not thou far from me, O JEHOVAH: O my strength, haste
thee to <span class="underline">help</span> me.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of salvation.  </p>

<p>Psalm 60:11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give us <span class="underline">help</span> from trouble: for vain <i>is </i>the help of
man.  </p>

<p>This is the same word again.  This verse is saying that
there is no help in a man-made salvation:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for vain <i>is </i>the help of man.  </p>

<p>Again, Psalm 46:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in <span class="underline">trouble</span>. 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; can refer to judgment and it can refer
to tribulation, but it very often refers to that day, the beginning of
judgment, the beginning of God&rsquo;s wrath.  </p>

<p>Look at Proverbs 1.  &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; is speaking, like we read in
Proverbs 8 where &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; speaks in the first person, &ldquo;I wisdom.&rdquo;  Christ is &ldquo;the
wisdom of God,&rdquo; and so Proverbs 1:20-22 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:  </p>

<p>This is really saying that the Word of God goes out to the
whole world.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: She
crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the
city she uttereth her words, <i>saying,</i> How long, ye simple ones, will ye
love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate
knowledge?  </p>

<p>Most of the opening chapters of the book of Proverbs talk
about the Bible and how it is the wisdom and the instruction of God, that the
Bible is where we get our knowledge.  </p>

<p>We continue on to read in Proverbs 1:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
you, I will make known my words unto you.  </p>

<p>Then Proverbs 1:24-27 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would
none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh
as a whirlwind; when <span class="underline">distress</span> and anguish cometh upon you.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;distress&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; in Psalm 46:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in <span class="underline">trouble</span>. 
</p>

<p>Let us finish Proverbs 1.  It goes on to say in Proverbs
1:27-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh
as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call
upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not
find me:  </p>

<p>We can anticipate this.  We can picture this.  </p>

<p>Then Proverbs 1:29-30 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
JEHOVAH: They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reproof&rdquo; means &ldquo;correction.&rdquo;  It continues on in Proverbs
1:31-32:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay
them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>

<p>Then Proverbs 1:33 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil.  </p>

<p>Here is that word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; again that we saw in Jeremiah 17:17, Ecclesiastes 11:2, and Ecclesiastes 12:1.  </p>

<p>Getting back to Psalm 46:1 again, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble.  </p>

<p>Chris just went over these verses a little while ago.  Psalm
46:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  </p>

<p>We saw the power of that water in the tsunami in Japan.  It
was just amazing.  Chris mentioned how it was traveling around 500 miles an
hour.  I think that an earthquake travels over 1,000 miles an hour, and what
this great earthquake will do and how it will push the water is just
incomprehensible to us.  We can see how it will remove or carry away hills and
mountains.  </p>

<p>But God&rsquo;s people will not fear:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;though the earth be <span class="underline">removed</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This sense of this word &ldquo;removed&rdquo; is &ldquo;changed.&rdquo;  The earth
is going to be removed or changed.  </p>

<p>We also see this word in Hosea 4.  In most of the book of
Hosea, God is upbraiding Israel for turning to idols.  Hosea 4:6 says:   </p>

<p class="verse">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to
me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy
children.   </p>

<p>We know that Old Testament Israel prefigured the New
Testament church.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Hosea 4:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <i>therefore </i>will
I <span class="underline">change</span> their glory into shame.  </p>

<p>This is the same word as &ldquo;removed.&rdquo;  Again, the sense of
this is &ldquo;changed.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I believe that this is best seen in Hebrews 1:12.  We read
in Hebrews 1:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: They shall perish; but
thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; And as a vesture
shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is going to change this universe.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.  </p>

<p>So this is the sense of this word &ldquo;removed&rdquo; in Psalm 46:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;carried&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;removed&rdquo; in other
places.  It is in the same sense here of just the utter devastation of an
earthquake that progresses around the world and the damage that it is going to
do.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 46:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Though </i>the waters [<i>of the sea</i>] thereof roar <i>and
</i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 
</p>

<p>The end of Psalm 46:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 
</p>

<p>All through the Bible, God likens the sea to hell, to His
eternal damnation.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 93.  Psalm 93:1-3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; JEHOVAH is clothed
with strength, <i>wherewith </i>he hath girded himself: the world also is
stablished, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne <i>is </i>established of old:
thou <i>art </i>from everlasting. The floods have lifted up, O JEHOVAH&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking of the sea here and likens the sea to unsaved
people.  It continues in Psalm 93:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">The floods have lifted up, O JEHOVAH, the floods have lifted up
their voice; the floods lift up their waves. JEHOVAH on high <i>is </i>mightier
than the noise of many waters, <i>yea, than </i>the mighty waves of the sea. Thy
testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O JEHOVAH, for ever. 
</p>

<p>So here in Psalm 46, the meaning of this is quite deep. 
This is actually also speaking of the unsaved.  As the mountains are carried
into the sea, He says in Psalm 46:3:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Though </i>the waters thereof <span class="underline">roar</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;roar&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;raged&rdquo; in Psalm 46:6: 
</p>

<p class="verse">The heathen <span class="underline">raged</span>, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered
his voice, the earth melted.  </p>

<p>Men are going to be roaring and raging.  The nations are
going to be raging at God as this happens.  Again, He likens unsaved people to
the proud or &ldquo;mighty waves of the sea.&rdquo;  This is really very deep, because
there are a couple of spiritual principles in here.  </p>

<p>So, again, He says in Psalm 46:3:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Though </i>the waters thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though
</i>the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.  </p>

<p>No one is sure what &ldquo;Selah&rdquo; means.  The general sense of
this is probably that this is important, that we are to pay attention to what
has been said and meditate on it and ponder it.  </p>

<p>Then the vein of this Psalm changes a little bit in verse
4.  He says in Psalm 46:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>There is </i>a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the
city of God, the holy <i>place </i>of the tabernacles of the most High. God <i>is
</i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved&hellip;  </p>

<p>This river certainly has to be speaking of the Gospel as it
flows out of Zion, the city of God.  </p>

<p>Look at Revelation 22:1.  This is speaking of the New
Jerusalem:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.  </p>

<p>Certainly, this is the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Then verse 2 is speaking of that city, the New Jerusalem. 
It says in Revelation 22:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
river, <i>was there </i>the tree of life, which bare twelve <i>manner of </i>fruits,
<i>and </i>yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree <i>were </i>for
the healing of the nations.  </p>

<p>So we read in Psalm 46:4:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>There is </i>a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the
city of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word here for &ldquo;make glad&rdquo; is often translated as &ldquo;rejoice&rdquo;
in the context of salvation.  The &ldquo;city of God&rdquo; is referring to the true
believers.  They are the true &ldquo;city of God,&rdquo; which Jerusalem, the land over in
the Middle East, represented.  </p>

<p>Psalm 50:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The mighty God, <i>even </i>JEHOVAH, hath spoken, and called the
earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Out of Zion, the
perfection of beauty, God hath shined.  </p>

<p>Zion is another word for Jerusalem, and Jerusalem
represented the Kingdom of God.  So this is the city that &ldquo;the streams whereof
shall make glad&rdquo; is talking about.  </p>

<p>Psalm 46:4 again:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>There is </i>a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the
city of God, the holy <i>place </i>of the tabernacles of the most High.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 46:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved&hellip;  </p>

<p>God has always spiritually dwelt among His people.  He says
in Matthew 18:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
am I in the midst of them.  </p>

<p>Turn to Deuteronomy 23.  God is telling the Israelites to
keep their camp clean.  We do not read about latrines here, but He commanded
them to carry a shovel when they went to relieve themselves.  They were to bury
this and keep the place clean.  Deuteronomy 23:12-14 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
shalt go forth abroad: And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon&hellip;  </p>

<p>What He means here is a shovel.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt
dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: For
JEHOVAH thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give
up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no
unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.  </p>

<p>The principle that God is spiritually dwelling among His
people is all throughout the Bible, and He will literally dwell among them in
the consummation.  </p>

<p>This is what Psalm 46:5 is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Moved&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;carried&rdquo; from Psalm 46:2.  We
see just an assortment of words here in this Psalm that have to do with the
devastation of an earthquake.  </p>

<p>Psalm 46:5 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved [<i>or
carried away</i>]: God shall help her, <i>and that </i>right early.  </p>

<p>Where this says &ldquo;<i>and that </i>right early,&rdquo; this is
literally translated as &ldquo;at the turning of the morning.&rdquo;  This word &ldquo;help&rdquo; is
in relation to salvation and also that He is their refuge in the time of
trouble.  </p>

<p>When I first read this verse and saw what it was saying, &ldquo;God
shall help her, at the turning of the morning,&rdquo; I thought that this might
contradict the idea of this progressive earthquake, because Mr. Camping has
been talking about how this will come at the end of the day.  This makes sense
and is beginning to come together all through the Bible.  It is the end of the
day of salvation.  </p>

<p>In relation to this, the Israelites had to offer a sacrifice
every morning and every evening.  The day of salvation is really speaking of
the entire period when God was saving from the beginning, when Adam and Eve
fell, to the very end, to the last day; and so Christ is the morning.  The
morning is part of salvation also, but the morning is the beginning of a day. 
It connotes a new beginning.  In the book of Revelation, Christ is called &ldquo;the
bright and morning star&rdquo; and He is likened to the morning.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Exodus 14.  In Exodus 14, the Israelites have
crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians are pursuing them.  We read in Exodus
14:23-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
of the sea, <i>even </i>all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And
it came to pass, that in the morning watch JEHOVAH looked unto the host of the
Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of
the Egyptians, And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily:
so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for JEHOVAH
fighteth for them against the Egyptians.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Exodus 14:26-27:      </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
and upon their horsemen. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and
the sea returned to his strength when the <span class="underline">morning</span> <span class="underline">appeared</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>These are the same two words that we find in Psalm 46:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God shall help her, <i>and that </i><span class="underline">right</span> <span class="underline">early</span>. 
</p>

<p>So this is speaking of the turning of the morning.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Exodus 14:27-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled
against it; and JEHOVAH overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. And
the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, <i>and </i>all
the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so
much as one of them.  </p>

<p>Then we read at the end of verse 30, Exodus 14:30:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.  </p>

<p>I thought that this would contradict this idea of the
progressive earthquake with it starting at the evening, but it does not because
God uses the morning in a different way.  The morning gives the sense of the
beginning of salvation.  </p>

<p>When the Israelites were brought out of Egypt, He brought
them into the wilderness for forty years.  This was like the beginning of
salvation.  That forty-year sojourn in the wilderness was a picture of the
church age.  It was also a picture of the sojourn of a believer&rsquo;s life in the
wilderness of this world.  </p>

<p>We can read all through the Bible of Moses or Joshua or
Abraham and how they rose early to do this or that.  Rising early is in the
context of the atonement.  </p>

<p>Look at John 20.  This is when Mary Magdalene went to the
tomb.  John 20:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The first <i>day </i>of the week&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that this reads &ldquo;the first of the sabbaths.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the
sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.  </p>

<p>God emphasizes all through the Bible that Christ rose early
in the morning.  We also read of these men rising early to do this or that, and
the sense of this expression is in the context of salvation.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 57.  This is a Psalm of David.  Psalm 57:7-9
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
give praise. Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I <i>myself </i>will
awake early. I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
thee among the nations.  </p>

<p>Again, this is David, a very prominent figure of Christ,
whom God inspired to write these words.  </p>

<p>We read this again in Psalm 108.  Psalm 108:1-3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
my glory. Awake, psaltery and harp: I <i>myself </i>will awake early. I will
praise thee, O JEHOVAH, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee
among the nations.  </p>

<p>I also want to look at Psalm 30.  Psalm 30 is a beautiful
Psalm extolling the Lord for His salvation.  Psalm 30:3-5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">O JEHOVAH, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou
hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto JEHOVAH, O
ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his
anger <i>endureth but </i>a moment; in his favour <i>is </i>life: weeping may
endure for a night, but joy <i>cometh </i>in the morning.  </p>

<p>I believe that this is speaking of salvation.  The night can
be relating to when we are in darkness before salvation or when we are in
tribulation, but I do not think that this verse in Psalm 46 contradicts the
idea of judgment coming at the end of the day, the end of the day of
salvation.  </p>

<p>Continuing in Psalm 46, we read in Psalm 46:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God
shall help her, <i>and that </i>right early [<i>at the turning of the morning</i>]. 
</p>

<p>Verse 6 continues in the sense of the devastation of the
earth in this earthquake.  Psalm 46:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heathen raged&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;nations.&rdquo;  Again,
we can see the sense of the sea roaring as God compares the unsaved to the
ocean.  </p>

<p>In Isaiah 57:20-21, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wicked <i>are </i>like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<i> There is </i>no peace, saith my
God, to the wicked.  </p>

<p>Again, Psalm 46:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved&hellip;  </p>

<p>We see this word &ldquo;moved&rdquo; again.  This is a word that is
often translated as &ldquo;slip,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;He will not suffer thy foot to be <span class="underline">moved</span>&rdquo;
or to slip.  All of these different words in this Psalm have to do with the
earthquake removing or destroying all of the kingdoms and the landscape of this
earth.  </p>

<p>Verse 7 is comforting us again.  Psalm 46:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH of hosts <i>is </i>with us; the God of Jacob <i>is </i>our
refuge. Selah.  </p>

<p>We see this word &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; again.  Then verse 8 says, Psalm
46:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Come, behold the works of JEHOVAH, what desolations he hath made
in the earth.  </p>

<p>This is again speaking of the time of the great earthquake. 
</p>

<p>Then verse 9 says, Psalm 46:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the idea of Armageddon.  It is that final battle. 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.  </p>

<p>This is the ultimate victory, again, of Armageddon in that
day.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 46:10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be still, and know that I <i>am </i>God&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still&rdquo; is a word that is translated other places in the
Bible as &ldquo;cease&rdquo; or &ldquo;forsake&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay.&rdquo;  The sense of this is that it is
entirely God who has won this victory for us and who will come again in the
end, in the consummation.  </p>

<p>The sense of this is like what we read in Exodus 14 when the
Israelites feared as they saw the Egyptians bearing down on them.  It is not
the same word that we see here, but the sense of it is the same.  It also has
to do with salvation, because we contribute absolutely nothing to our
salvation.  Those who are saved were named before the foundations of the world;
and, again, God did all of the work of Christ before the foundations of the
world.  So in Exodus 14, the Egyptians are pursuing the Israelites and they are
getting close.  Then in Exodus 14:11-12, which is referring to the Israelites,
it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they said unto Moses, Because <i>there were </i>no graves in
  Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?<i> Is </i>not this the word
that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the
Egyptians?&hellip; </p>

<p>Is this not amazing?  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;For <i>it had been </i>better for us to serve the Egyptians,
than that we should die in the wilderness.  </p>

<p>Then Exodus 14:13 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
see the salvation of JEHOVAH, which he will show to you to day: for the
Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo;  This is
the way it works.  It is entirely of the Lord&rsquo;s work, and He gives this trust
to His people.  They will stand still in that day and watch God work.  </p>

<p>So Psalm 46:10 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be still, and know that I <i>am </i>God: I will be exalted among
the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 46:11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH of hosts <i>is </i>with us; the God of Jacob <i>is </i>our
refuge.   </p>

<p>This is the third time that this word &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; appears in
this Psalm.  Then this Psalm ends with:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Selah.  </p>

<p>Psalm 46:10 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be still, and know that I <i>am </i>God: I will be exalted among
the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.  </p>

<p>This is the bottom line.  It is all to God&rsquo;s glory.  </p>

<p>In His mercy, it is still the day of salvation.  Salvation
will continue for a few more weeks.  If we are not sure, we can continue to beg
God for His mercy.  We can continue to supplicate until that last instant for
our loved ones, for our family, for others around us.  </p>

<p>Let me just close by reading a couple of verses in Psalm
41.  Tom Holt pointed this out a week or two ago.  This is just one of those
passages that we have read over and over again, and yet it never struck us as
to what it was actually saying.  We read in Psalm 41:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>is </i>he that considereth the poor: JEHOVAH will
deliver him in time of trouble. JEHOVAH will preserve him, and keep him alive; <i>and
</i>he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the
will of his enemies. JEHOVAH will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing:
thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness. I said, JEHOVAH, be merciful unto
me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.  </p>

<p>This is the contrition of a true believer as he comes before
God.  </p>

<p>Let us pray.  </p>
