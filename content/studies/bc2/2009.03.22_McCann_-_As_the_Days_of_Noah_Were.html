<p>If everyone could turn to Matthew 24, I am going to just
read a few verses out of this chapter, beginning in verse 35.  Matthew 24:35-39: 
  </p>

<p class="verse">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away. But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man, </i>no, not the angels of
heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so shall also
the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
that Noe entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them
all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.   </p>

<p>If you have had a chance to share about May 21<sup>st</sup>,
2011 being the Rapture and about the 5-month period of torment followed by the
destruction of the world on October 21, 2011, maybe you have mentioned this to
friends or family or people whom you know, and they have come back to you and
share a verse like Matthew 24:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Actually, this is fairly common today amongst people in the
churches when they do hear that there is a date set.  You tell them that this
date comes from the Bible and they say, &ldquo;No, no, no; you cannot do this with
the Bible because no one knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  Well, this is one of the
verses.  There are a few verses that do say this and this is one of them here
in Matthew 24:36.  </p>

<p>It is very significant and important that after making this
statement, God speaks of the days of Noah and He likens it to the time when Christ
will come, as it says in Matthew 24:37:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe (Noah) <i>were, </i>so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>So there is a comparison that God is making.  He is actually
directing us to the book of Genesis, to the time before the flood, to look at
what happened, because what happened then is going to happen when the Son of
Man comes.  History is going to repeat and God is directing us there, just as
He does earlier in the book of Matthew, in chapter 24, when He speaks of the
abomination of desolation, as Daniel the prophet wrote about it.  That is an
indicator to go read the book of Daniel, to go look up the information dealing
with the abomination of desolation, and now He is mentioning Noah and He is
telling us to look at Noah.  </p>

<p>Also, if you go to Luke 17:26-27, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as it was in the days of Noe (Noah), so shall it be also in
the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they
were given in marriage, until the day that Noe (Noah) entered into the ark, and
the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>

<p>You can see, again, that this is indicating that the days of
Noah are going to repeat in our day.  </p>

<p>What happened in the days of Noah?  Well, God did send a
flood and it destroyed the whole world and everybody in the world perished,
except for Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives: eight people. 
Eight people lived through the flood, because they got into the ark when the
waters came.  No one had ever seen a flood like that before and not ever since
either, because the waters covered even the highest mountain.  I think that the
Bible says it was 15 cubits and upward.  </p>

<p>So it was a tremendous amount of water that God poured out
on the world, and they were all caught suddenly in the judgment.  As it said in
Matthew 24, they did not know.  Remember?  It says in Matthew 24:38-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe (Noah)
entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came&hellip;  </p>

<p>They were caught completely off-guard.  God came, we could
say, as a thief in the night and surprised them.  </p>

<p>Is it not terrible that God did not warn those people?  Is
it not terrible that they did not hear anything about the flood?  That they
knew nothing about it at all?  They were just purely ignorant of the flood!</p>

<p>Is that true?  Is that true?  That is <span class="underline">not</span> true, is
it?  They heard a lot about the flood in the days prior to the flood&mdash;and we
will look at how they heard&mdash;but despite that, God says that they were caught
off-guard.  </p>

<p>Do you think that there are going to be people on May 21<sup> st</sup>, 2011 who are caught off-guard?  Who are shocked?  And surprised? 
And it comes upon them suddenly?  That God has resurrected His people and
opened up the ground with great earthquakes, and then He has raptured all of
His people who were alive upon the earth and He has taken them up into Heaven? 

</p>

<p>Yes, we know that there are going to be multitudes of
people, hundreds of millions, if not billions, who survive the earthquake and who
are going to be surprised and amazed, &ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo;  But not a one of them
is going to be able to say, &ldquo;I did not hear about it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You see, this is what God is saying, &ldquo;As in the days before
the flood, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be,&rdquo; and history is going to
repeat itself.  It is shocking that God is telling us this before it happens,
but this is what is going to happen.  </p>

<p>Now, they were eating and drinking before the flood.  They
were eating and drinking.  Is it a wrong thing to eat and drink?  </p>

<p>No, we all have to eat and drink.  The Son of Man came
eating and drinking.  John the Baptist did not come eating and drinking, but it
did not matter because the church of their day, Israel, would not listen to
either one of them.  </p>

<p>People are good at trying to find a reason as to why they do
not have to listen to the truth of God&rsquo;s Word.  They will find something, even
if it is totally opposite.  They faulted John the Baptist for not eating and
drinking, and they faulted Christ for eating and drinking.  </p>

<p>Well, what could they do?  You know, what can you do to
please certain people?  The answer is: nothing.  So since the Son of Man came
eating and drinking, there is nothing wrong with eating and drinking.  </p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with marrying and giving in
marriage?  No, that is God&rsquo;s plan, is it not?  A man and a woman who are attracted
to one another, as long as they are qualified and they have never previously
been married, they can marry.  They can enter into a marriage relationship, and
that glorifies God because that is according to His commandment that males and
females marry and that their families give them away; the father gives away the
daughter.  They were marrying and giving in marriage, so what is the problem?  </p>

<p>Well, you see, this language just indicates life as normal,
life as usual.  It is typical.  It is what has happened in this world all
throughout history.  People eat and drink and people marry and are given in
marriage.  But, you know, the problem is that God was warning them.  He was
warning them of what was to come, and yet they still, after hearing the warning,
continued on as normal.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Nineveh for a contrast.  If you turn to the
book of Jonah, in Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>Look at the reaction in verse 5, Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>What is a fast?  I am not going to eat and I am not going to
drink.  It actually says this a little later on.  The king says in verse 7,
Jonah 3:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh
by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast,
herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:  </p>

<p>Why?  Why this kind of severe reaction?  Because they had
forty days.  They had forty days until they were going to be destroyed, and
they believed God.  </p>

<p>Now, it does not say that they believed Jonah; it says that
they believed God.  They believed the message that God sent through that one
individual, that lone prophet who was rather unusual because he had just come
out of the belly of a whale.  He was unkempt, disheveled, probably smelly, and
yet they believed this prophet who could have looked very strange to them, plus
he came from another nation.  </p>

<p>They believed his declaration that was only one sentence
long.  He brought nothing to back it up.  He did not do any miracles.  God did
not cause him to go into the city and raise the dead.  He did not have him go
in healing the blind or the deaf, as some of God&rsquo;s people, the apostles, were
equipped to do for a little while after Christ went into Heaven; they were
doing those kinds of miracles.  God did not validate the ministry of Jonah in
any way that we are aware of.  He did not have him be proved that he was a true
prophet, only that he went in and declared this sentence, and the whole city
from the king on down repented.  </p>

<p>So part of their repentance was to abstain from food and
drink because it was not going to be business as usual.  It was not going to be
their normal routine.  They had just heard information concerning time: &ldquo;Yet
forty days&rdquo;; and judgment: &ldquo;and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They took this seriously.  It became the most serious thing
in their lives at that point.  Commerce stopped.  Society stopped.  Social
relations stopped, like marrying and giving in marriage.  You do not marry when
you are sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  </p>

<p>All of these things that are normal&mdash;they are fine; they have
their place in this world&mdash;came to a close for a short period of time.  We do
not know how long they sat in sackcloth and ashes or how long they did not eat
or drink, and God does not want us to know.  He does want us to know that they
did not go on with their lives as they had been living, and that is the key. 
That is the important difference.  </p>

<p>This is why God says of the people prior to the flood that
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, from the day
before they knew, up until the day that Noah entered into the Ark.  It did not
impact them at all.  They did not believe.  They did not really believe; because
if you really believe, then you would repent.  The Ninevites did repent, but
the people before the flood did not repent; they did not turn.  </p>

<p>Now, one of the reasons might be because it was a long
period of time leading up to the flood.  If you go to Genesis 6:1-2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they <i>were </i>fair; and they took them wives of all
which they chose.  </p>

<p>This reference here to &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; is referring to true
believers or individuals.  Actually, I think it is better said that this is
referring to individuals in the families of true believers.  They had an
association with God.  They were part of those who knew that there was a God
and which God it was.  They were the &ldquo;sons of God.&rdquo;  And the &ldquo;daughters of men&rdquo;
were women who were of the world.  They were outside of that godly line.  They
did not follow Jehovah.  They did not follow the Lord.  </p>

<p>So they were unequally yoked, we would say today or as the
New Testament puts it, where you have believers marrying unbelievers, those who
profess to be Christian, we could say, marrying just anybody in the world.  But
God prohibits this.  This is not pleasing to Him, and this is what began their
trouble.  </p>

<p>Then it says in verse 3, Genesis 6:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
for that he also <i>is </i>flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.  </p>

<p>Now, what is this reference to 120 years?  This is a
reference to the time that Noah would have to construct the ark, to bring the animals
into the ark, to do everything that God wanted done, as far as that ark was
concerned.  There was 120-year window before the flood came.  </p>

<p>So God, at this point, is letting the world know and Noah
know that 120 years from this date will be the flood.  This would be the year
5110 B.C.   That is 120
years before the flood.  </p>

<p>And, you know, 120 years is a long time.  It is a long
time.  I mean, if we go back 120 years from this date, I think we would end up where?&hellip;1891
or 18-something (1889)&hellip;.it would be a period of time before automobiles and
before all of the technology began in this world.  That is a pretty long period
of time, and the world was given this length of time.  </p>

<p>At this point, Noah is a young man of 480.  He is 480.  He
still has 120 years before he becomes an old man of 600.  So He is middle-aged
at this point, and it is also interesting that 480 is multiples of 120: 4 x 120
= 480, which would be Noah&rsquo;s age, and God gave another 120-year period until
the flood.  </p>

<p>It just seems like that was too long for people.  That was
too long for people.  Forty days, okay I can see it.  Two years, you start
beginning to see it.  But 120 years?  </p>

<p>A verse like we find in Ecclesiastes 8, I think, applies. 
This is the chapter in the earlier verses, 5 and 6, where God speaks of a wise
man&rsquo;s heart discerning time and judgment.  In this same context, it says in
verse 11, Ecclesiastes 8:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>

<p>So they were given a period of time, and the nature of man
is to relax.  Relax.  This is off so far in the future, I may not even be
alive.  </p>

<p>Actually, this was the problem all along throughout the
Church Age with the coming of Christ.  He may come at some point distant, you
know, some faraway day in the future.   </p>

<p>So people live their lives eating and drinking, marrying,
giving in marriage, as normal.  They lived as normal, and yet 120 years, even
though it is a long period of time (especially to us today), it passed.  It
passed.  </p>

<p>The reference to 120 had to be to the flood because God did
not set man&rsquo;s age at 120.  They were living to hundreds of years before the
flood.  Even after the flood, many people passed a date of 120.  So that was a
timeline that God gave to the day or the year of the flood itself, that it
would be 120 years.  </p>

<p>Now, what was going on for that 120-year period?  What was
happening?  Well, God later gives Noah instructions.  He says in Genesis
6:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Noah found grace in the eyes of JEHOVAH. These <i>are </i>the
generations of Noah: Noah was a just man <i>and </i>perfect in his generations,

<i>and </i>Noah walked with God.  </p>

<p>Maybe we will look at this later, but Noah was saved in the same
way anybody today is saved: by grace.  &ldquo;By grace,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;you are saved
through faith; and that not of yourselves,&rdquo; in Ephesians 2:8-9.  He was saved
in exactly the same way anybody has ever been saved, through the grace of God,
as God bestowed upon him His mercy and grace and overlooked, or actually better
put, paid for those sins in Christ from before the foundation of the world, so
that He could overlook Noah&rsquo;s sin.  So there was no difference between him and
us today.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in verse 10, Genesis 6:10-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The earth
also was <span class="underline">corrupt</span> before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And
God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was <span class="underline">corrupt</span>; for all flesh
had <span class="underline">corrupted</span> his way upon the earth.  </p>

<p>What did they do that was so corrupt?  </p>

<p>In Deuteronomy 4, we find this word &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; in verse 16. 
It says in Deuteronomy 4:16: </p>

<p class="verse">Lest ye <span class="underline">corrupt</span> <i>yourselves, </i>and make you a graven
image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,  </p>

<p>Also in the same chapter, in verse 25, Deuteronomy 4:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">When thou shalt beget children, and children&rsquo;s children, and ye
shall have remained long in the land, and shall <span class="underline">corrupt</span> <i>yourselves, </i>and
make a graven image&hellip;  </p>

<p>So they were falling into idolatry.  They were making graven
images; the same story.  The same story before the flood as after the flood, up
until our day, as people worship images or ideas or doctrines out of their own
minds and not as God declares them to be through His Word.  At that time, it
was not written, but God did give revelation.  People did know His Word, and
yet they were making graven images and serving them and bowing down to them and
committing spiritual fornication.  As a result, God was displeased.  He was angry
with them and He had a plan to destroy them, as it says in verse 13, Genesis
6:13-15:   </p>

<p class="verse">And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy
them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in
the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this <i>is the
fashion </i>which thou shalt make it <i>of: </i>The length of the ark <i>shall
be </i>three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of
it thirty cubits.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on.  </p>

<p>So God is instructing Noah, &ldquo;Build this boat.  Here is the
type of wood.  Here is how you pitch it.  Here is how high it is going to be. 
It is going to have three decks or stories,&rdquo; very detailed instructions to a
man, and we really do not know what Noah was like personally or what skills he
had.  </p>

<p>Some people are good in building things and some people are not. 
Some people are not.  What if you had been given the instructions to build the
boat?  Well, we know that God would have qualified him and He did give him
three sons to help, and there could have been others who were hired labor to do
certain things.  But still, it was an enormous project that God gave to Noah
that would take some time.  You do not build a ship that size, without the
tools that we have today, in a quick period of time.  </p>

<p>So God gave him this 120-year period, and all during this
period, we can know that people were being warned.  They were being warned of
what was to come, because the boat itself, in its building, in its
construction, was a testimony to what God had told Noah, that a flood was
coming and that He would destroy the world with the flood.  </p>

<p>Or let us go to 1 Peter 3:18-20, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">1 Pet 3:18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also he went and preached unto the
spirits in prison; Which <span class="underline">sometime</span>&hellip;.</p>

<p>That is better translated, &ldquo;Which <span class="underline">aforetime</span>.&rdquo;   </p>

<p class="verse">Which <span class="underline">aforetime</span> were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>

<p>You see how Jesus preached to the spirits in prison the days
leading up to the completion of the ark.  &ldquo;While the ark was a preparing,&rdquo; the
Lord Jesus was preaching to the &ldquo;spirits in prison.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;spirits in prison&rdquo;
are those who are taken captive by Satan at his will.  They are in the prison,
in the dungeon of their own confinement.  Their own sins are wrapped about them,
like cords, holding them fast.  They are prisoners to sin and to Satan.  But God
preached; the Lord Jesus preached.  </p>

<p>How did He do it?  Well, how does God preach today?  It is
God; remember even when Jonah went into Nineveh, the Ninevites believed God.  Jonah
was preaching the preaching that God bid him, it says in Jonah 3, but they did
not see Jonah, necessarily.  They understood that it came from God and that the
preaching was from God, and that is how God has set it up.  </p>

<p>We are ambassadors for Christ and we do beseech you in His
place or in His stead, &ldquo;Be ye reconciled to God.&rdquo;  Since we are an ambassador,
we are messengers carrying information from the King to people, but God is the
One who actually sent us.  We are the ones who are sent into the world to
preach so that others might hear and become saved, and yet God is the One who
is actually doing the preaching.  He is the One who has moved us to obey Him to
get His Word into the world.  </p>

<p>So here, Jesus was preaching during the period of time that
God was long-sufferingly waiting for the ark to be completed.  He had already
seen the sin, the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart was only evil continually when God
visited them in the year 5110 B.C., and anyone who would have died would have
died under the wrath of God if they were not saved; they would have been
condemned.  But God put up with their sins for another 120 years because He had
a plan, and that plan included Noah and his family.  </p>

<p>Or turn over to 2 Peter 2, and I will start reading in verse
4.  We read in 2 Peter 2:4-5, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <i>them </i>down
to hell, and delivered <i>them </i>into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
judgment; And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth <i>person, </i>a
preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
ungodly;  </p>

<p>You see what God is saying about Noah.  He is describing him
as a &ldquo;preacher of righteousness,&rdquo; and, you know, of course he would have shared
what he knew from God, all the information, because that is what God commands
His people, to not hold back anything but to bring the whole counsel of God.  </p>

<p>Noah would have told people, as he was building the ark. 
Maybe a little five-year old boy comes up and says, &ldquo;Noah,&rdquo; or probably with a
lot more respect, &ldquo;Mr. Noah, what are you doing?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I am building an ark, son. 
I am building an ark because God has told me that He is going to destroy the
world in so many years.&rdquo;  They would have seen him working and his sons
working.  He was always busy with that boat.  </p>

<p>Now, Noah also probably had to make a living.  It is not a
business to build an ark.  He was building that ship in obedience to God, but
he also would have needed some kind of income.  He would have had to have done
some type of work, maybe a farm, maybe building other things for people, so he
could not devote all of his time to the construction of the ark.  That is
another reason why God gave 120 years, because Noah would have to provide for
his family.  </p>

<p>So we do not know a lot of details, but we do know that the
construction itself&mdash;the building of the ship&mdash;was a testimony and a witness to
anybody who would see or live nearby.  </p>

<p>At that time, there could have been one or two million people
in the world, but remember that it was all one continent.  The days of Peleg
had not come yet; the world was not divided.  Also, there was one language. 
The tower of Babel had not happened and there was not all the languages that we
find today.  There was one language and one continent, and we see later in
Genesis at the tower of Babel that the people wanted to come together, which is
the nature of most people.  People want to live in close proximity with other
people.  </p>

<p>So Noah, yes, he is building this ark and the people are not
like thousands of miles in that direction over an ocean.  They are all
somewhere, probably in a region.  They would be spread out to some degree. 
But, more than likely, the vast majority of people knew what Noah was doing.  They
had to know.  </p>

<p>Just think of Jonah, again.  Think of Jonah.  He does not even
have a tract.  He does not have a backpack full of tracts.  He has no paper at
all, no literature.  He only has his voice, however far that will carry, and he
was not, it appears, all that eager in bringing the message to the Ninevites. 
But he went into the city and he made his declaration and God multiplied it or
made it abound (I do not know what God did) to the degree that the whole city
heard.  The 120,000 people in Nineveh heard, as a result of Jonah, one man,
entering into a city.  </p>

<p>This is just one idea of how the Word of God can spread and
how God can forewarn people, when He has a mind to, of what He is about to do. 
</p>

<p>So God set up Noah and established him to build this boat. 
We can be sure that the people saw it, and what was their reaction?  Did they
have a reaction?  Did they respond?  </p>

<p>Well, God does not tell us all the details, like with Sodom. 
We knew that Lot&rsquo;s sons-in-law mocked when they heard that God was going to
destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.  But God does not fill us in.  </p>

<p>It would have been interesting, would it not, if God would
have filled us in and given us some accounts of people standing afar off and
having a good joke on old Noah, on this fool, (he is not an old man yet) on
this crazy man?  He obviously is off his rocker and insane, or whatever else
they could think of.  </p>

<p>People are quick with the wit to just make it sound like it
is nothing you have to worry about.  You do not have to worry about this ark. 
You do not have to worry about this flood that is supposedly coming.  No, do
not worry.  Do not worry.  Just go on with your life.  That is the counsel of
man that has always proven wrong but always proven to have many people listen
to it and agree with it, and so they go about their lives like nothing ever
happened.  </p>

<p>We know today that as it was in the days of Noah, so shall
it be in the coming of the Son of Man.  You can find many people who scoff, and
that is what God tells us.  There will be scoffers in the last days.  They just
do not think that it is important.  </p>

<p>Sometime, type in &ldquo;May 21, 2011&rdquo; in Google or Yahoo and you
will find groups that have popped up, Chat Groups or Forums on the Internet,
and they are discussing certain things.  There is a group about the Mayans.  It
is interesting, because anybody is free to post.  A Family Radio listener went
in and posted the information about May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, and they went
off on a thread discussing this.  What really struck me and stuck in my mind was
this one person who said, &ldquo;You know, I joined this Mayan Chat Group to talk
about 2012 as the possible end of the world because I thought it would be fun. 
I thought it would be fun; but now, we are discussing this May 21, 2011 and it is not fun.  It is not fun!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You see, the people really do not believe the Mayan prophecy
of 2012, so you can talk about that.  You can joke about that.  You can have a
deep discussion about that, because it has absolutely no chance of happening,
and I think that people realize that.  But when you are coming seriously and
you are presenting verses from the Bible and you are saying that this
information came only from the Bible and no other way, then it ruins the fun. 
It ruins the fun!  People just want a quick quip, just a quick little witticism
to dismiss it so that they do not have to listen to it and they do not have to
worry about it, and the church is trying to provide this.  The church is trying
to provide this by informing everyone, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour.  No man
knows.  You do not have to worry about it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is very sad that they are coming up with this, because
let us read that again in Matthew 24.  It says in verse 36 that no one knows
the day or hour, and then it says in Matthew 24:37-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>2 Peter 2 told us that God brought the flood upon the world
of the ungodly.  All of the unsaved, all of the wicked, all those who had no
relationship, no true relationship with God, they were not saved in any way. 
They were surprised.  They were caught off-guard.  Christ came as a thief in
the night.  </p>

<p>Someone brought up this verse the other night when we opened
up the &ldquo;May 21, 2011 &ndash; The Rapture!&rdquo; room on Paltalk in the Christianity section. 
She brought up this verse, &ldquo;See, no one knows the day or hour.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Okay, you brought up the verse.  Look at the context, &ldquo;As it
was in the days of Noah, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.&rdquo; 
Nobody knew in the whole world in the days of Noah?  That is not true.  Noah
knew and Noah&rsquo;s family knew.  They knew for 120 years.  </p>

<p>If that is not good enough, go to Genesis 7:4-5, where God
comes to Noah and says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I
destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all that
JEHOVAH commanded him.  </p>

<p>God came to Noah in the 120<sup>th</sup> year, the year 4990
B.C., and He said, &ldquo;Now I am going to get more precise.  I am going to give you
an exact day, an exact day,&rdquo; which is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

month of Noah&rsquo;s 600<sup>th</sup> year.  &ldquo;One week from this day, Noah, the
flood will come and the world will be destroyed.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Matthew 24 tells us, &ldquo;As in the days of Noah, so shall
the coming of the Son of Man be,&rdquo; and we find that Noah had advance
information.  He was forewarned.  He had to be in order to build the ark.  Then
even more so, God told him the exact day and month, as well as the year.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, well, no man knows the day or hour.  No man knows.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>That is true.  Not of ourselves, but that does not mean that
we cannot know, that God cannot reveal it, that He cannot forewarn us, as He
does before all judgments.  </p>

<p>Let us look at one other reference to Noah in the New
Testament, in Hebrews 11.  Hebrews 11:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah&hellip;</p>

<p>Again, when we read Hebrews 11, the references to faith are
always to Christ, &ldquo;By the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; we could say, or &ldquo;By Jesus.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house&hellip;  </p>

<p>See how God is telling us that it had not happened yet?  It
was only in God&rsquo;s mind.  He was going to do it.  He declared that He would do
it, and yet for a period of time, it was as though it had not happened.  </p>

<p>There was a world before the flood.  There was a time that
this world existed before the flood, and people were warned of that day just
like we are being warned today.  Has May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 come yet?  It is
not here.  </p>

<p>Well, it tells us here in Hebrews 11:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.  </p>

<p>Many people are going to believe on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 when they see it, when it happens, when someone in their family is taken up
or when their backyard opens up from an earthquake because there are some
bodies of people who died there 800 years ago.  </p>

<p>People are going to see it on that day and then they will
cry, &ldquo;Lord, Lord!,&rdquo; because that is what the Bible tells us.  But then it is
too late because the door is shut and God has already gathered His people and
there are no more plans to spare the world or to save anybody else.  It is all
over and done with.  The door is shut.  Christ is the Door, and the Door of
Salvation has closed and will never open again; that is it.  </p>

<p>Well, God, you see, is telling us to hear the warning now,
right now.  Do not put it off, as men tend to do.  Men naturally do this.  </p>

<p>Let me read that verse again in Ecclesiastes 8:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.  </p>

<p>No, the guillotine is not falling today or tomorrow.  Well,
it could, individually, for any person.  It is not scheduled for today or
tomorrow.  It is scheduled for May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011.  </p>

<p>So people are thinking, I know because the Bible tells us
that this is the nature of people, &ldquo;I have two years; I have two years, so I
can still live like I want to live the rest of this year, maybe all of 2010.&rdquo; 
You know, who knows what goes on in the minds of people?  &ldquo;Maybe on January 1<sup>st</sup> 2011, I am going to get serious with God; I am going to start listening
to what I am hearing.  You see, I can still enjoy the world for like a year and
a half and then get serious at that time.  Boy, I will start praying then!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, in all likelihood, in all likelihood, a person who
thinks that way, when January 1<sup>st</sup> comes, they will put it off and
put it off, because they are not a child of God.  If you are thinking that way,
that is not the mindset that God would give us.  We should think right now, at
this time, &ldquo;It is time to go to the Lord; it is time to beseech Him for His
mercy.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What can we beseech Him for?  &ldquo;O Lord, take me into the
ark!  O Lord, have mercy on me that I might enter into the safety of the Lord
Jesus Christ and be saved so that I will not perish, so that I will not die and
I will not miss out on eternal life and living forever.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Yes, but someone might say, &ldquo;But it is different.  It was
different for Noah than it is for me today, because God told Noah personally. 
God came to Noah and told him directly to build the ark.  He instructed him on
what to do and Noah, of course, obeyed.  If God told me that way, if He spoke
to me out of Heaven, I would obey, too!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, let us read Hebrews 11:7 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he
condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by Christ
(by faith).</p>

<p>The key here is the warning, that Noah was warned of God.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 19.  It says in Psalm 19:7-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">The law of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of
LORD <i>are </i>right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>pure,
enlightening the eyes. The fear of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>clean, enduring for ever:
the judgments of JEHOVAH <i>are </i>true <i>and </i>righteous altogether. More
to be desired <i>are they </i>than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also
than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: <i>and </i>in
keeping of them <i>there is </i>great reward.</p>

<p>You see, God warns by His Word.  His Word, which are all
those words there that are synonyms for the Word of God: the Law, the Testimony,
the Statutes, the Commandments, the Judgments; exactly like Psalm 119.  They
are synonyms; they are all speaking of the same thing, &ldquo;By these things&mdash;or the
Word, the Bible&mdash;is Thy servant warned.&rdquo;  That is how we are warned.  </p>

<p>You are hearing, &ldquo;Yet seven days,&rdquo; as it says in Genesis 7, &ldquo;and
the flood comes.&rdquo;  Then 2 Peter 3 tells us &ldquo;one day is as a thousand years, and
a thousand years as one day.&rdquo;  That is right from the Bible, and it so happens
that in 2011, it will be exactly 7,000 years from the flood.  7,000; we are
it&mdash;we are it.  </p>

<p>If it was 5500 years from the flood, people would not have
to worry; you could relax.  But 2011 is 7000 years exactly.  And, of course, we
know that the end of the great tribulation, which began on the day before Pentecost
in May of 1988, is coming to a close on May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011, and that May
21<sup>st</sup>, 2011 is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of
the Hebrew or Biblical calendar, which is the day that God shut Noah and his
family and animals into the ark.  </p>

<p>With that move, God delivered those eight people and also
the animals, and at the same time, He shut out, forever, all those who were in
the world so that they could not enter into the ark anymore.  They drowned and
they perished and they were destroyed.  </p>

<p>It is terrible.  It is very sad that as the days of Noah, so
shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man.  This is going to
happen to multitudes of people, and yet God in His mercy has ordained that tens
of millions find grace in His sight.  A great multitude will become saved
leading up until that day, until the very last one.  </p>

<p>Well, let us stop here.  </p>
