<p>Let us go to Jonah 3.  I will read the whole chapter.  Jonah
3:1-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of
JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey. And
Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose
from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with
sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and
published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor
drink water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence
that <i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent,
and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw their
works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that
he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it </i>not.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>Well, you had to know that we would go to Jonah 3, right?  I
hope that you know why.  Why would we be going to Jonah 3 today?  The reason is
because we have forty days until May 21<sup>st</sup>, and this is the length of
time that God gave to the Ninevites.  He gave them forty days.  We often try to
put ourselves in their shoes; now we can.  On this day, right today, we can.  </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to have
been a Ninevite and to have had some crazy guy come into your town, some guy
who had just come out of a whale&rsquo;s belly and who came walking into town and
said, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown&rdquo;?  This is all that the
Bible records that he said.  Maybe you might have heard him yourself or maybe
you did not, because Nineveh was a big city.  Nineveh was a &ldquo;great city of
three days&rsquo; journey.&rdquo;  He went in &ldquo;a day&rsquo;s journey&rdquo; and then proclaimed this
message.  </p>

<p>How many people could have heard Jonah without a microphone
or a megaphone or with no way of broadcasting this message to the whole city
like we have in our day?  How many people could have heard him say this?  Maybe
he went to the busiest market to cry out, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Maybe only a couple hundred people or maybe a couple
thousand people heard this message.  The Bible says that Nineveh was a &ldquo;great
city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons&rdquo; or 120,000 people. 
Maybe Jonah even proclaimed this more than once, but the Bible does not tell us
this.  He could have continued into the city, going to this place and to that
place and saying the same thing.  We do not know.  All we know is that he went
into the city one day&rsquo;s journey and cried out one time and made the statement
that in forty days, Nineveh would be overthrown.   </p>

<p>We do know that the king was not there, because it says in
Jonah 3:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh&hellip;  </p>

<p>So the king did not even hear Jonah personally.  He did not
hear Jonah directly.  More than likely, only a few people in Nineveh heard
these words directly; and yet what happened?  </p>

<p>What happened was that whoever was there to hear, they
shared this with their friends and with their family, and so on.  This message
went from person to person to person; yet as we get further and further removed
from Jonah the prophet, we would think that the people would have believed this
message less and less.  What we find, though, is that they actually believed
this.  They actually and literally believed this.  </p>

<p>We do not find that Jonah went into the city and found a man
with palsy and told him to stand on his feet.  We do not find that Jonah went
into the city and healed any of the blind or made any of the deaf to hear or
any of the dumb to speak or any of the dead to rise.  Jonah did not do any of
this.  He just said one single sentence.  </p>

<p>What proof did Jonah offer for what he was proclaiming? 
What proof did he give to show that what he was proclaiming was true?  </p>

<p>We have to relate this to our day.  We are proclaiming that
May 21<sup>st</sup> will be Judgment Day.  We are doing this because there are
many infallible proofs that are coming from the Bible in relation to how God
has developed the timeline of history and has locked everything in.  </p>

<p>Even so, many, many people say, &ldquo;This is not enough.  What
else is there?  Come on; show me something else.  Prove this to me.  Show me
where in the Bible it says these things.&rdquo;  But when you do take the time to
show how these things are all laid out and how this all works out, this does
not convince them.  This does not change their mind.  </p>

<p>Were the Ninevites a special sort of people?  Were they
different than us?  It is true in our day that we think that we are much more
enlightened.  We think that since we are a modern society, we know more than
those ancient people who worshipped idols.  Unfortunately, we worship idols in
our modern-day society as well.  Actually, this happens quite a bit.  </p>

<p>The issue is, however, that there was a lack of evidence.  Jonah
had nothing to back this up.  He had nothing to prove this.  He performed no
miracles to verify that he was a true prophet of the Lord.  Actually, when we
examine this, he provided measly information.  He only said one sentence that
was given to perhaps a few hundred people or maybe a couple of thousand, and
then this word went through all of the city and they believed God.  They
actually believed God.  </p>

<p>Since we have forty days from today, I thought that this
would be a good time for us to go back to this chapter and to take a look at
this.  We only have forty days, which can go pretty fast, pretty quickly.  In
three weeks, we will be on May 1<sup>st</sup>.  When we look at it from this
perspective, this is coming very fast.  </p>

<p>Again, we cannot get around a date on a calendar.  There is
no way to avoid this.  We cannot go from May 20<sup>th</sup> directly to May 22<sup>nd</sup>,
as so many people would like to be able to do.  Many people say, &ldquo;I cannot wait
for May 22<sup>nd</sup> to come,&rdquo; and I am sure that they cannot.  From their
perspective, they greatly desire for May 22<sup>nd</sup> to come without event,
without any change in the earth or any of these things coming to pass.  </p>

<p>There are many, many people who are hoping and wishing that
May 21<sup>st</sup> will come and go.  They want to be able to get to May 22<sup>nd</sup>
so that they can get back to their normal life in this world, but there is no
normal life in this world at all.  Wanting to go back to normal in this world
is a problem all of its own.  If anybody wants to go back to the normalcy that
this world offers, this is a serious problem.  It is a serious problem if
someone enjoys and prefers this world to what God is saying is coming in His
Kingdom, which is an eternal life with eternal blessings.  When people greatly
want this day to pass, this is really an indicator that there is a deeper
problem in their life.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Jonah 3:1.  This says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 
</p>

<p>We read about the first time that God came to Jonah in
chapter 1 when God came to him and told him to go to Tarshish.  This is when he
tried to flee because he did not want to do this, and so he got into a ship
that was going to Tarshish.  He wanted to escape and to get away from his task,
from the duty that God gave him to do.  Then the Lord arranged a storm to come
at sea.  In order to quiet the storm, the mariners threw him overboard.  God
immediately quieted the storm and also arranged for a whale, a great fish to
come and to swallow him up.  After three days and three nights in the whale&rsquo;s
belly, Jonah was spit out onto dry ground.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Jonah 2:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon
the dry <i>land.</i>  </p>

<p>So the Word of the Lord is going to come to Jonah a second
time, as we read in Jonah 3:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
I bid thee.  </p>

<p>God is telling us that He put words in Jonah&rsquo;s mouth that He
told him to preach, and this is exactly what Jonah did preach.  </p>

<p>Let us first consider what Jonah did not preach.  Jonah did
not say, &ldquo;Oh, you Ninevites, God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.&rdquo; 
He did not preach this; God did not bid him to preach this.  He also did not
say, &ldquo;Peace and safety to you people of Nineveh.  May you live long and
prosper, and may you have quietness in your city.&rdquo;  He did not say this.  He
gave no &ldquo;peace and safety&rdquo; message.  In his message, there was also no grace,
no compassion, and no mercy that we read about.  Jonah did not say, &ldquo;Yet forty
days and God will overthrow Nineveh, but be encouraged because He is a gracious
and merciful God.  He is good and compassionate, and so He might spare you.&rdquo; 
God did not give all of this other information, even though we know this to be
true.  He gave a message that had none of these things, a message that only
contained two elements: time and judgment.  </p>

<p>So we read in Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>The number 40 is used in the Bible mostly as a time of
testing.  For example, the Israelites spied out the land for forty days.  It
can also relate to judgment, because they spied out the land for forty days and
then came back with an evil report and had to wander in the wilderness a year
for each day.  They spied out the land for forty days, and so they had to
wander in the wilderness for forty years.  This was a punishment.  This was a
judgment of God upon them.  </p>

<p>So when God uses the number forty, it relates to testing. 
Jesus was tested in the wilderness for forty days.  But this can also involve
judgment, and we now have forty days left, each one of us.  This means that
there is a final test in our lives.  </p>

<p>God has been testing all along during this Great
Tribulation.  We are now at the end of this.  We have forty more days and the
Great Tribulation, this time of testing, comes to an end.  It will be over. 
Now, especially, we are down to the wire.  We are down to the end of all
things.  </p>

<p>What is the test?  The test is whether or not we will
believe God.  This was also the test for the Ninevites as God gave them the
message, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  If we put ourselves
in their place, we could quickly and easily write this off.  </p>

<p>If you had heard Jonah proclaiming this, you could have
said, &ldquo;I do not know this guy.  I do not know him at all.  He is a stranger. 
Why should I believe him?&rdquo;  You could have also said, &ldquo;Not only is he a
stranger, but he is a foreigner from Israel, which is another nation and an
enemy nation.  Why in the world would I want to listen to a Jew, to an
Israelite, to this stranger who is telling me that I am going to be judged in
forty days?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Those who were more concerned amongst the Ninevites could
have taken what Jonah had said and run to their priests.  They were Assyrians,
so the Ninevites would have had holy men just like the other nations.  They
could have gone to these priests and asked, &ldquo;Have you heard anything from God? 
Is God going to destroy us in forty days?  Is God going to overthrow the city?&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>These holy men of Nineveh could have been offended that
anyone would dare make a claim like this without first checking with them, and
so they could have said, &ldquo;No; God has not revealed anything to us.  You know
that we are the holy men of God.  If God was going to do something like this,
He would have certainly told us.&rdquo;  But this did not happen.  Nothing like this
happened.  They did not dismiss this.  They did not ignore this.  They did not
go to their holy men to verify this.  </p>

<p>Have you ever noticed what is done when someone is
interviewed about May 21<sup>st</sup>?  By this time, I think we could write
the script.  This is how the news media approaches this topic.  They come to
one of the individuals who is in the caravan or who is holding up a Judgment
Day sign.  Then they ask them, &ldquo;Do you think that May 21<sup>st</sup> will be
Judgment Day?&rdquo;  This person responds, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Then they explain why they think
that May 21<sup>st</sup> will be Judgment Day, and I think that God has really
opened the mouth of His people.  He has given &ldquo;a mouth and wisdom, which all [<i>their</i>]
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.&rdquo;  They give a good answer
because they are referring to the Bible.  </p>

<p>What happens next does not happen all of the time, but it
does happen a lot.  After hearing from the child of God who tells them that
Judgment Day will be May 21<sup>st</sup>, the reporter goes to a pastor, to someone
whom they consider to be in authority, and they say, &ldquo;Pastor, tell us
something.  These people over here are saying that Judgment Day will be May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
What do you think?&rdquo;  The pastor says, &ldquo;No; no man knows the day or hour.  There
have always been these predictions that have come up all throughout history,
especially in tough economical times.  It is often then that we will find that
these predictions are raised up, but they will come and go.  There were over
200 in the past, and the 201<sup>st</sup> will come and go like the rest.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Sometimes the media really piles it on.  There was an
article in the Philadelphia Enquirer that was written by someone who was not
content with just one pastor.  He had to go to three or four.  When they all
said the same thing, then they believed that they had the assurance that this
was something that they need not worry about since these pastors did not
believe that this was going to happen.  </p>

<p>The news media thinks that these people have the authority
to say that this is not going to happen because they are the Lutherans, they
are the Presbyterians, they are the Episcopalians, they are the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses,
they are the Seventh-Day Adventists, and they all say the same thing; and so, finally,
there is agreement.  In the church world, there is finally agreement.  They do
not agree on anything else; and yet, amazingly, they agree that no man can know
the day or hour; and so this is how the news report most often ends.  They
close out on a happy note, on what they consider to be a good note, which is
that man cannot possibly know when the end will come.  After all, they went to someone
in authority.  </p>

<p>Is the pastor the authority?  Is the church the authority? 
Or is the Bible the authority?  The Bible says that May 21, 2011 will be Judgment Day.  We can put this on a scale and then we can pile up on the other
side of the scale two billion professing Christians who say that this will in
no way happen and that we cannot know.  Does this balance out or does their
opinion outweigh the Bible?  No; absolutely not, because it does not matter how
many people are against this.  All of the world could be saying this and it
would not matter.  </p>

<p>If God is saying that this is the day, the appointed day of
judgment, then this will be the appointed day of judgment; and He is definitely
saying this.  His pattern all throughout Biblical history has been that He
forewarns before He judges.  This is why He sent Jonah to Nineveh to say, &ldquo;Yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>To me, what is more astounding than Jonah being swallowed by
a whale - living through this and then being vomited out three days later - is
that the Bible says that &ldquo;the people of Nineveh believed God.&rdquo;  They believed
God without any evidence and without any proof.  </p>

<p>This reaction of the Ninevites did not happen all of the
time.  Noah preached a similar message before the flood.  How many believed
Noah?  Only his own family believed what he was saying, and it was God who
worked out that eight souls out of a few million believed at that time.  </p>

<p>So belief does not happen all of the time.  The reason for
this is what we find in the book of John.  To get the context, Jesus is
speaking to those who &ldquo;believed on him.&rdquo;  He was not talking to those who said
that they did not believe Him.  It says in John 8:31:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is whom He was talking to, to professed Christians.  </p>

<p>In John 8:44-45, He is still talking to those who &ldquo;believed
on him.&rdquo;  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are of <i>your </i>father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell <i>you </i>the
truth, ye believe me not.  </p>

<p>Wow!  They believe Him not, but not because He is telling a
lie.  If He lied to them, they would believe Him.  </p>

<p>I hope that no one is doing this here, but we used to lie to
our children.  Those whom God has brought to Himself no longer do this, but the
rest of the world still does.  In one way or another, they will tell their
children a lie.  They say things like, &ldquo;Santa is coming!&rdquo;  Do their children
believe them?  When they are young, yes; they believe this.  They also say, &ldquo;The
Easter Bunny is coming to give you some candy and eggs!&rdquo;  Do their children
believe?  Yes.  </p>

<p>We tell lies all of the time.  We love lies.  This is why we
watch television.  This is why we go to movies.  This is why all of the things
of the world interest us so much, because they are all lies.  They are all a
delusion.  Yes; it is real.  You can hold these things.  They are physically
there.  Your iPod is in your hand.  What you are doing with that iPod is the
lie.  </p>

<p>Is it not sad when people come home and turn on their
television and just sit and watch things, every single day of their lives? 
This is where they cry.  This is where they laugh.  This is where they are
enraptured with interest.  They are living their life through images on a
screen, through stories.  They suspend all belief when they watch this stuff
because they get all caught up in what they are seeing.  It is like they are
really there and that this is what is really happening, and it is all a lie.  </p>

<p>People love to read books.  I used to read a lot of books. 
I used to read Stephen King novels.  Guess what?  There are no vampires.  It is
all a lie!  There are no aliens either.  This is also a lie, but how many
people believe that there really are aliens?  Guess what else?  A fortune
teller cannot tell your fortune.  This is also a lie.  </p>

<p>When we look at life, it is a lie in just about every area,
especially when you go to church and the church says, &ldquo;Be baptized and you will
be right with God,&rdquo; and when the church says, &ldquo;Walk down this aisle, say the
sinner&rsquo;s prayer, accept Christ, and then you will be saved.&rdquo;  These are all
lies, even though people strongly believe this.  They have great confidence and
faith in these things, &ldquo;I know I was saved when I accepted Christ so many years
ago,&rdquo; and it is a lie.  </p>

<p>So Jesus is giving the reason in John 8:45:  </p>

<p class="verse">And because I tell <i>you </i>the truth, ye believe me not.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 8:46:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
do ye not believe me?  </p>

<p>Why do people not believe that Judgment Day is May 21<sup>st</sup>? 
Why?  What is the real reason?  What is the truth about this?  We read again in
John 8:46:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  </p>

<p>Then He gives us the real reason in John 8:47:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God&rsquo;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them
</i>not, because ye are not of God.  </p>

<p>This is what it comes down to.  The people prior to the
flood who perished in the flood were not of God.  It says in 2 Peter 2 that the
flood came upon the world &ldquo;of the ungodly.&rdquo;  They knew all about the flood
because Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of righteousness,&rdquo; but they were not of God and
did not believe to the point of going to God and beseeching Him and casting
their lives upon Him.  </p>

<p>Instead, they believed their neighbors, they believed their
family members, they believed others, because everybody else in all the world
believed the same thing, &ldquo;Noah is a nut, even though he is a good guy and a
nice guy.&rdquo;  We know that people have a way of flowering up their attacks, &ldquo;Noah
is a good neighbor in many ways, but he is a nut!  He is crazy.  He has been
building that ark for year after year after year after year.  Look; we are
still here; and now he is telling us that we only have seven days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is very safe and comfortable to go with the flow of the
world.  This is what most people do and they do not believe the Word of God. 
The people of Noah&rsquo;s day perished because of this, and so, too, will many, many
people perish in just forty days because they do not believe the truth of the
Word of God.  They are being warned.  They are hearing the sound of the trumpet
with their physical ears, but they are not taking any action or doing anything
about this.  Therefore, they really do not understand and they are going to
take their chances.  This is the tragic thing that we are seeing all around
us.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Jonah 3:3.  It says:   </p>

<p class="verse">So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of JEHOVAH.
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey.  </p>

<p>Where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city&hellip;  </p>

<p>This literally means:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;a great city to God&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word for &ldquo;God&rdquo; is in the Hebrew.  If you look in an Interlinear
Bible, this word &ldquo;exceeding&rdquo; is the word &lsquo;elohiym, which is the word for &ldquo;God.&rdquo; 
It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Nineveh a great city to God&hellip;</p>

<p>Therefore, if it was &ldquo;a great city to God,&rdquo; it was an &ldquo;exceeding
great city.&rdquo;  This is what the translators thought, which is true.  It was a &ldquo;great
city,&rdquo; because God had much people there and He wanted to make a positive
example of them.  </p>

<p>We have many negative examples of those who do not believe,
like Lot&rsquo;s sons-in-law.  In Genesis 19, God told Lot, &ldquo;We will destroy this
place&hellip; escape for thy life.&rdquo;  Then Lot went to his sons-in-law and told them
almost word-for-word what the Lord had told him, &ldquo;Up, get you out of this
place; for the LORD will destroy this city.&rdquo;  Then we read, &ldquo;But he seemed as
one that mocked unto his sons in law.&rdquo;  This is to say that they said something
like, &ldquo;Father-in-law, you cannot be serious!  You really cannot be serious. 
You must be joking,&rdquo; and then maybe they had a laugh.  </p>

<p>Well, Lot was very serious.  There was no time to waste. 
They were laughing then, but soon the fire and brimstone would fall from
Heaven.  At that point, there was no more laughter; there was no more joy.  </p>

<p>Then we read again in Jonah 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be <span class="underline">overthrown</span>.  </p>

<p>Go to Genesis 19.  We read in Genesis 19:24-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then JEHOVAH rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from JEHOVAH out of heaven; And he <span class="underline">overthrew</span> those cities&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word as &ldquo;overthrown.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  </p>

<p>So God is using here the same word that He used with Sodom
and Gomorrah and the cities of the plain.  We know what this means then.  If they
were going to be overthrown, they were going to be utterly destroyed.  They
would have been completely destroyed, as God did to those four cities of the
plain.  </p>

<p>Going back to Jonah, it says in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>What can fasting refer to?  It can refer to when someone
stops eating, but we do not have to do this.  In these last 40 days, no one
should think, &ldquo;I am going to stop eating from now until May 21<sup>st</sup>.&rdquo; 
God does not care if you eat or do not eat.  He would care if you were starving
yourself; otherwise, it does not matter.  God is using this word for fasting to
represent something spiritually.  </p>

<p>The important thing here is that they proclaimed a fast and
they did stop eating and drinking.  This is important because if we go to
Matthew 24, it says in Matthew 24:37-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all
away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>They were warned.  Why else would God indicate that they
were &ldquo;eating and drinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;marrying and giving in marriage&rdquo; if He had not
first told them that judgment was coming at a specific time?  </p>

<p>So this means that this was wrong of them, but why?  God
gave the institution of marriage; there was nothing wrong with doing this.  God
knows that we have to eat and drink; there is nothing wrong with doing this
either.  What was wrong was for them to continue on with their lives, normally
going on day after day.  This is why He is pointing out that they were &ldquo;eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If we go to Luke 17, it also speaks of the flood, as well as
of Sodom.  We read in Luke 17:27-30:  </p>

<p class="verse">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and
destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same
day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and
destroyed <i>them </i>all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man
is revealed.  </p>

<p>These people were just continuing on.  They were eating,
drinking, marrying, building, planting, like it was just another day in the
world.  They were acting like it was just another normal day, and this was the
problem.  This was the problem then and this is probably the problem with some
here.  With a lot of people, the problem is that they are hearing this &ndash; and
they might even believe this or have an interest in this &ndash; but they are going
on as normal.  </p>

<p>We have to do some things; this is true.  We may still have
to work.  We may still have school.  God tells us that whatever we are doing, &ldquo;do
<i>it </i>heartily, as to the Lord.&rdquo;  This is what we tell our children if they
are still in school where they are still being tested in subjects.  They
sometimes ask, &ldquo;Why should I continue doing these things if May 21<sup>st</sup>
is Judgment Day?&rdquo;  The reason is because whatever they are doing, they are to &ldquo;do
<i>it </i>heartily, as to the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are to serve Him wherever He has placed us.  However,
there is also a certain mindset and an attitude that some can have, which is
just to continue going about a daily routine, our daily normal business, when
we are hearing something that is not typical, something that should evoke a
response that is not one of just continuing on with everyday type of events. 
This warning is not to be taken as though we are hearing just anything else.  </p>

<p>This is the end of the world.  This is &ldquo;the end of all
things.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The end of all things is at hand.&rdquo;  It is &ldquo;<span class="underline">the</span> <span class="underline">end</span>.&rdquo; 
There will be no more ends.  &ldquo;<span class="underline">The</span> <span class="underline">end</span>&rdquo; is here.  In forty days,
the world will be destroyed.  In forty days, Judgment Day begins.  Then it will
be over, for all intents and purposes.  There will only be left a five-month
period of great sorrow, of torment.  </p>

<p>This information ought to at least allow each person who
hears this to interrupt their lives.  Stop what you are doing.  Stop the way
that you are going.  Stop all of the unnecessary things that you do and start
thinking seriously about your relationship with God.  </p>

<p>We can look at it this way.  I have never experienced this,
but I know that through the news this happens all of the time.  A hurricane is
coming through the Caribbean.  It is approaching the coast of Florida or Texas
or some other state.  They get a warning coming over their television or radio
station from the Emergency Alert System (EAS).  This interrupts their
programming.  </p>

<p>If we did this concerning the warning of May 21<sup>st</sup>
being Judgment Day, all kinds of people would get upset.  They would be mad, &ldquo;How
dare you interrupt our comedy show!  How dare you interrupt the movie that we
were watching to tell us this news!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If the Emergency Alert System interrupts regularly-scheduled
programming to tell people that a hurricane is coming directly for them where they
live in their town on the coast, are they going to turn this off?  This is what
some people do with this warning of May 21<sup>st</sup>.  They turn their back
to this information.  They turn around and move away from it.  </p>

<p>But if a huge hurricane is heading their way that is going
to destroy their entire town, are they just going to turn around and go into
the kitchen to do the dishes?  After hearing this, are they just going to walk
around the house vacuuming and preparing their meal?  </p>

<p>What about their children?  Their children are probably
running through the house and going off to play.  Are they not going to say something
to them?  Are they just going to wave goodbye to their children, &ldquo;Have a nice
day&rdquo;?  How horrible!  How awful!  </p>

<p>There are usually one or two people who will ride out a
storm; but most people know that if they have just been warned, they need to
react, &ldquo;I need to take care of things!&rdquo;  Then they frantically board up their
windows and gather their valuables.  They gather their children whom they love
and make sure that they are in the car and ready to go so that they can get out
of town and flee this danger.  </p>

<p>The only difference between that type of warning and this
warning of May 21<sup>st</sup> is that this is a billion times worse and that
this is spiritual, because this warning is spiritually discerned.  We cannot
look at weather maps to determine this.  We do not rely on the weather people
to tell us that this is coming; and yet people have more trust in the weather
people when they tell us that a hurricane is coming than they do in the God of
the Bible who created the weather.  </p>

<p>God is telling us that the end of all things will be May 21<sup>st</sup>
of this year, forty days from now.  Are we to continue just preparing our meals
and eating and drinking, laughing, marrying and giving in marriage?  There are
going to be people who will be having their weddings on May 21<sup>st</sup>,
because this is a Saturday in the spring.  This is the tragedy that Jesus was
speaking of, &ldquo;Because I tell <i>you </i>the truth, ye believe me not.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Going back to Jonah, we read in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>What does &ldquo;sackcloth&rdquo; indicate?  We do not have time to go
to too many places, so let us just go to Esther 4.  If you do look up this word
for &ldquo;sackcloth,&rdquo; you will find that this is often in connection with mourning
and sadness.  It says in Esther 4:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Mordecai perceived all that was done&hellip;  </p>

<p>What had been done?  We read in Esther 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the letters were sent by posts into all the king&rsquo;s provinces,
to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old,
little children and women, in one day, <i>even </i>upon the thirteenth <i>day </i>of
the twelfth month&hellip;  </p>

<p>They were given a date, a date of judgment, a date in which
they were to perish.  If they reached this date, they would die unless
something happened between the point that the proclamation was given and when
this date was to arrive.  Otherwise, all Jews were going to die.  </p>

<p>Here is the reaction of Mordecai and the Jewish people.  We
read in Esther 4:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; And came even before the king&rsquo;s
gate: for none <i>might </i>enter into the king&rsquo;s gate clothed with sackcloth. And
in every province, whithersoever the king&rsquo;s commandment and his decree came, <i>there
was </i>great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing;
and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.  </p>

<p>This is sanity.  This is evidence of people who have their
wits about them, people who have soundness of mind.  They understand that they
are going to die on a set date, but they also understand that there is a God
who can spare them, that there is a God who can rescue them and deliver them
and save them.  He is a faithful God and a good God and a merciful God, and so
they went to Him.  This interrupted their lives.  When someone puts on
sackcloth and ashes and they are weeping and wailing and mourning, this means
that something has interrupted their lives.  </p>

<p>It is very important that they were mourning, because the
world laughs now.  The Bible says, &ldquo;Blessed <i>are </i>they that mourn,&rdquo; and
yet the world laughs now.  They do not want to mourn.  They do not want
sadness.  They do not want sorrow.  </p>

<p>For instance, we read in Luke 6:24-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that
laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.  </p>

<p>If you laugh now, enjoy yourself.  Continue in &ldquo;the
pleasures of sin,&rdquo; as you have, as I have, as we all have.  Continue.  Continue
allowing television and Internet and iPods to take up your time, all of these
things that are so numerous that we cannot even keep track of them.  Continue
to allow these things to be something that consumes and wastes your time on a
daily basis.  You will enjoy your pleasure now, but there will come a time when
you will mourn and weep.  </p>

<p>In Revelation 18, this is what is going on.  The people of
the world are seeing this judgment approaching, because it has begun, and then
there will be weeping and wailing from the people of the world.  For now, we &ldquo;sow
in tears,&rdquo; and yet the Bible says, &ldquo;but joy <i>cometh </i>in the morning.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So be a little cast down.  Shed a few tears.  We should.  We
really should and we should go to God and beseech Him.  Ecclesiastes tells us, &ldquo;<i>It
is </i>better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of
feasting.&rdquo;  Allow this information to seep into your mind, and it will cast you
down if you are not saved.  If you are saved, what about your family?  You will
begin to greatly sorrow for them and you will begin to mourn at this time, but
then joy is coming soon.  On the other hand, continue.  </p>

<p>Each of us now has forty days, as Jonah 3:4 proclaims:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>

<p>Of course, there is one more day or milestone that we will
observe shortly from Genesis 7:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Here we see similar language, and we are only 33 days away
from the time when we will be able to say, &ldquo;For yet seven days&rdquo;; but God&rsquo;s
grace and mercy is here right now.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Zephaniah 2.  This is very comforting and
should really bring great consolation to us.  We read in Zephaniah 2:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
desired; Before the decree bring forth, <i>before </i>the day pass as the
chaff, before the fierce anger of JEHOVAH come upon you, before the day of
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S anger come upon you. Seek ye JEHOVAH, all ye meek of the earth, which
have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
shall be hid in the day of JEHOVAH&rsquo;S anger.  </p>

<p>It may be.  There is no guarantee.  </p>

<p>Let us end with Jonah 3.  They were sitting in sackcloth and
ashes, and then we read in Jonah 3:6-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with sackcloth,
and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and published
through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink
water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God:
yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is
</i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent, and turn
away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </p>

<p>So this is not guaranteed, but it could be.  It may be that
God will turn away from destroying the individual who goes to Him on His terms,
because we also have to remember how merciful and kind He is.  When anyone ever
went to Jesus, He never turned them away; never.  No matter what they requested
as far as healing, He healed them in every case.  This does not mean that He
will or that He is obligated to heal us from our sin, but this does tell us of
His nature and how good and kind He is.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
