<p>We are going to read Scripture today from Romans 8 where Christ
is asking us a question.  We read in Romans 8:35-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? <i>shall </i>tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it
is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as
sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  </p>

<p>These verses are wonderful verses for the child of God.  We
take great comfort in knowing the fact that nothing will ever &ldquo;<b>separate us
from the love of God</b>,&rdquo; nothing in this world.  This is a great security for
us.  For those who are truly a child of God, we have this confidence that
nothing will separate us from Christ; nothing in this life will ever be able to
&ldquo;<b>separate us from the love of God</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we see May 21, 2011 quickly approaching, the true
believers ought not to worry; because if you are a child of God, you are safe
and secure in Christ.  Nothing shall worry us.  Yes, the true believers are
greatly concerned about our loved ones who are not saved.  This weighs heavy on
the child of God&rsquo;s heart.  Who does not have a family member&mdash;a husband, a wife,
a child, anyone, a friend&mdash;whom you try to share the Gospel with and you get nowhere
with them?  You get nowhere and it weighs on you.  However, we know that God is
the One who has to save that person.  He is the One who has to open the eyes of
that person.  He is the One who has to give that person &ldquo;<b>a new heart</b>.&rdquo; 
God has to do all the work of saving that person, but it weighs on us because we
see that they still continue in their sin.  They are still in rebellion against
God, and we see that time is slowly going by.  Every day that goes by, every
month, every week, it is getting closer and closer to that time when salvation will
no longer be possible.  If that loved one should die in their sin, all hope of
salvation for that person is gone; it is gone.  It will no longer be possible
for that person to cry out to God for mercy.  But as children of God, we take
great comfort in that we are eternally secure in Christ.  We are saved
forever.  He has given us &ldquo;<b>eternal life</b>.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>Many believe a teaching that I have heard before in the
churches, one that says that you can lose your salvation, but that is not
possible.  If you are truly a child of God, you are eternally secure in Christ. 
Nothing &ldquo;<b>shall separate us from the love of </b><b>Chris</b><b>t</b>,&rdquo; as we
read earlier.  This is why He asked this question in verse 35, Romans 8:35:</p>

<p class="verse">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&hellip;  </p>

<p>He asked this question, and then God goes on to list a whole
bunch of things here.  In verse 38, Romans 8:38, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am persuaded, that neither death&hellip;  </p>

<p>And death is the enemy of mankind.  Even physical death will
not separate the true believers &ldquo;<b>from the love of </b><b>Chris</b><b>t</b>.&rdquo; 
There is nothing that can possibly separate us.  He has us.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a few verses in Psalm 119.  We take great
comfort in the fact that we are eternally secure in Christ.  In Psalm 119:49-56,
we read:</p>

<p class="verse">Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
me to hope. This <i>is </i>my comfort&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is Christ, the Word of God, and we take comfort in this. 
</p>

<p class="verse">This <i>is </i>my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
quickened me. The proud have had me greatly in derision: <i>yet </i>have I not
declined from thy law. I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have
comforted myself.  </p>

<p>The true believers take comfort in God&rsquo;s Word.  It is our
comfort.  It is our hope.  </p>

<p class="verse">Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. This I
had, because I kept thy precepts.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s Word is a comfort to us.  No matter what we are going
through in life, whether tribulations or afflictions or whatever besets the
true believers, we take great comfort in God&rsquo;s Word because we know that God is
faithful to the promises and commitments that He has given to His people.  He
is faithful and we comfort ourselves with this knowledge.  If we are not taking
comfort in God&rsquo;s Word, then something is wrong.  </p>

<p>Here we are approaching May 21, 2011 and our loved ones are not saved, and yet we know that whatever God does is absolutely perfect. 
We take comfort in the fact that whatever He does is absolutely right.  So we
are to comfort ourselves in the Word of God, because it is God who is speaking
to us from the Bible.  </p>

<p>This is the same idea in Romans.  Turn in your Bibles to
Romans 15:4-6.  It says: </p>

<p class="verse">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have
hope. </p>

<p>The Word of God is a comfort to us, His people.  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the God of patience and consolation&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; could also be translated as &ldquo;comfort.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p class="verse">Now the God of patience and [<i>comfort</i>] grant you to be
likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with one
mind <i>and </i>one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

</p>

<p>We take great comfort in what God says to us because we know
that it is &ldquo;<b>impossible for God to lie</b>.&rdquo;  Whatever He has said, He will
do.  He has the ability to do what He says.  So we take great comfort in what
God says because His Word is true.  </p>

<p>Turn also to 2 Corinthians 1:3.  We read there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; </p>

<p>If we are a child of God, as we read God&rsquo;s Word, we will
take great comfort in it.  We know that we can pour out our hearts before Him
and that He understands and knows.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 4, 2 Corinthians 1:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is why I said earlier that if we are going through
tribulations or trials, God comforts us as we read His Word.   </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble,
by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s Word is our comfort.  This is what true believers
desire.  We desire God&rsquo;s Word.  Because God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit indwells us, this is
what we take comfort in.  We do not take comfort in the things of this world. 
We know that the things of this world are going to be destroyed very shortly. 
God&rsquo;s Word is our comfort and He is our Comforter.  </p>

<p>Let us look at 1 Thessalonians 4.  God is speaking here about
the end of the world and the resurrection, and so forth.  We will pick up the
context in verse 15.  1 Thessalonians 4:15-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
are alive <i>and </i>remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them
which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first: Then we which are alive <i>and </i>remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.  </p>

<p>Judgment Day is approaching and we take great comfort in the
Word of God.  We are also to &ldquo;<b>comfort one another</b>&rdquo; with the Word of
God.  We have to take great comfort in what God says because His Word is
absolute truth.  </p>

<p>This is not really a study in the subject of comfort.  I would
really like to speak a little bit about our security in Christ.  We are secure
in Christ if we are a child of God.  If we are a child of God, it is not
humanly possible for us to be separated from God because we are eternally
secure in Christ forevermore.  </p>

<p>When we read about the ark in the days of Noah, the ark was
a picture of Christ.  God was about to bring the flood upon the earth in Noah&rsquo;s
day and that ark was a picture of Christ.  Noah and his family entered into the
ark and they were safe.  They were secure.  The flood did not overcome them
because Noah was safe in Christ.  So, too, when we become saved.  When we truly
become a child of God, God indwells us.  At that point, it is like we enter
into Him and we are safe there.  Noah was safe from the flood because of the
ark.  Because of Christ, he was not destroyed in the flood of his day.</p>

<p>With Lot, we also see that true believers do not perish.  Lot
in his day was not destroyed in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah because Christ
was his Saviour.  With the Old Testament believers, we know that they were
saved in the exact same way as we are saved today.  Christ was their Saviour
also.  They were saved because of Christ.  They were not destroyed in the flood
and they were not destroyed in Lot&rsquo;s day, in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah,
because of Christ.  This is because we are safe and secure in Him.  We cannot
lose this, as many might believe.  If we are truly saved, let me say this
again, we are eternally secure in Christ.  We cannot lose our salvation; God
has us.  </p>

<p>God goes on in parts of the Bible to tell us that His Holy
Spirit indwells us.  How can we lose that?  If we can lose our salvation, then
we cannot call it salvation.  There is a works gospel that the church has been
teaching for years in which you could lose something that you never had.  But
once you are truly a child of God, you are eternally secure in Christ.  </p>

<p>Let us go on a little further and look at Ephesians 1.  We
are eternally secure in Christ because of what Christ has done and not because
of anything that we can do.  In a very familiar passage in Ephesians 1, God
tells us in Ephesians 1:4-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">According as he hath chosen us&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are the elect of God and chosen:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;in him before the foundation of the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see how secure we are?  We are elected in Christ &ldquo;<b>before
the foundation of the world</b>.&rdquo;  Before He created anything, from eons of
eternity, God has already elected His people to salvation.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world, that we&hellip;  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;should be holy and without blame&hellip;  </p>

<p>We become blameless when we become saved.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;before him in love: Having predestinated us unto the adoption&hellip; 
</p>

<p>In all these phrases, He is telling us that we were
predestinated and that we were adopted into the body of Christ.  </p>

<p class="verse">Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the
glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verses 11-14 of this same chapter, Ephesians
1:11-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
counsel of his own will: That we should be to the praise of his glory, who
first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also <i>trusted, </i>after that ye heard
the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye
believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest
of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the
praise of his glory.  </p>

<p>In all these words that He has used&mdash;we were purchased by
Him, we are eternally secure in Him, and God just goes on&mdash;there is no way that we
can look at all of these verses.  God just keeps going on and on to tell us how
safe and secure we are in Christ.  He will not lose one of His people.  We are
secure in Him, no matter what.  </p>

<p>Let us also look at John 10 where God gives us more
information about how safe we are in Him.  No matter what happens to us in this
life, we are safe in Christ.  In John 10:22-24, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon&rsquo;s porch. Then came the Jews
round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If
thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.  </p>

<p>Many people are like this today.  You try to tell them about
 May 21, 2011 and they say, &ldquo;Show me in the Bible where you see May 21, 2011.&rdquo;  They are basically asking the same question as these Jews.  They are
asking Christ, &ldquo;<b>If thou be the </b><b>Chris</b><b>t, tell us plainly</b>,&rdquo;
but the Bible is not written that way.  The Bible was written in parables.  </p>

<p>So when they are saying, &ldquo;Tell me in the Bible where you see
that Judgment Day begins on May 21, 2011,&rdquo; they are asking the same question.  Of
course, we cannot show them this because of the way in which the Bible was
written.  It was written in parables.  The whole Bible is written in parables. 
These things are hidden in the Bible.  So the Jews are asking Christ the same
thing, &ldquo;<b>If thou be the </b><b>Chris</b><b>t, tell us plainly</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read that Christ says in verses 25-28, John 10:25-28:
</p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, I told you&hellip;  </p>

<p>You see, Christ told them.  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
that I do in my Father&rsquo;s name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not,
because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and
I know them&hellip;  </p>

<p>God knows each and every one of His elect.  He knows every
one of them, as we read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal
life&hellip;  </p>

<p>This life that He has given to us is eternal.  Yes,
physically, our lives might end in this world.  But what happens to the true
believers when they leave this world?  God said, &ldquo;<b>T</b><b>o be absent from
the body</b>&rdquo; is &ldquo;<b>to be present with the Lord</b>.&rdquo;  We leave our bodies,
but the true believer really does not die.  Their body dies and goes to the
grave and decays; but in their spirit, they are with Christ.  You see, this is
where they experience the new birth.  Our bodies are still under the curse of
God, so it dies just like the unsaved.  </p>

<p class="verse">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish&hellip; 

</p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Never</b>.&rdquo;  Come May 21, 2011, what happens?  The true believers are &ldquo;<b>caught up</b>&rdquo; to be with Christ.   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they shall never perish, neither shall any <i>man </i>pluck
them out of my hand.  </p>

<p>Do you see the security that we have in Christ?  No one can
snatch us out of the hand of Christ.  We are eternally secure there.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verses 29-30, John 10:29-30: </p>

<p class="verse">My Father, which gave <i>them </i>me, is greater than all; and
no <i>man</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>God is repeating Himself. </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and no <i>man </i>is able to pluck <i>them </i>out of my Father&rsquo;s
hand.  I and <i>my </i>Father are one.  </p>

<p>How wonderful this is!  Talk about a guarantee!  &ldquo;<b>N</b><b>o
<i>man </i>is able to pluck <i>them </i>out of my Father&rsquo;s hand.</b>&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you are truly a child of God, you are safe forever.  No
matter what happens to you in this life, you are safe in Christ.  You can lose
your home.  You can lose your job.  You can lose all of these physical things,
which are not important to begin with (and we will see this a little later). 
What you have and what you do not have of this world is unimportant; because if
you have salvation, if you are &ldquo;<b>born again</b>,&rdquo; you have everything.  </p>

<p>Look at Lazarus.  What did he have?  He had sores.  What
possessions did he have of this life?  He had nothing; yet in one sense, he had
everything.  </p>

<p>So we should not be caught up with our physical
circumstances.  Whatever we have or do not have is unimportant.  The important
thing is whether or not we are saved.  Are you &ldquo;<b>born again</b>&rdquo;?  Has God
saved you?  </p>

<p>If we are saved, we know that we are going to be the
inheritors of &ldquo;<b>the new heavens and the new earth</b>&rdquo; shortly.  Very soon,
we are going to be the inheritors of this.  However, the unsaved will de
destroyed forever.  What do they have?  They have nothing.  Really, they have
nothing at all.  </p>

<p>Let us look at some other verses.  In Matthew 13:19, the
word for &ldquo;catcheth away&rdquo; can also be translated as &ldquo;pluck.&rdquo;  No one can catch
us or pluck us away from Christ because we are eternally secure in Him.  No one
can catch us away from Him.  God indwells us and He has us.  </p>

<p>But God also goes on to tell us some more information.  God
tells us that our &ldquo;<b>names are written in heaven</b>.&rdquo;  It is amazing how God
just keeps on giving us these assurances, over and over and over again.  At
times, many tend to lose sight of this.  </p>

<p>Turn to Luke 10.  In Luke 10, the context is that the
seventy went out with the Gospel and they were all excited.  Christ is now
going to bring them back down to earth a little bit.  In Luke 10:17-20, He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through thy name. And he said unto them, I beheld
Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall
by any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits
are subject unto you; but rather rejoice&hellip;  </p>

<p>What should they rejoice in?  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because your names are written in heaven.  </p>

<p>Do you see how Christ has brought them back down to earth?  All
of these things were going on as they went out with the Gospel and they were
rejoicing.  Yet Christ said, &ldquo;Do not rejoice in that.  Rejoice in the fact that
you are a child of God, that &lsquo;<b>your names are</b> <b>written in heaven</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
  </p>

<p>Do you see how safe we are in Christ?  No matter what is
going on in life, we ought not to lose sight of the fact that if we are a child
of God, we are eternally secure in Christ.  We are never alone; therefore, we
are to take comfort in the Bible.  We ought to start thinking about the
promises of God that we find in His Word that He has given to us.  If we are
truly saved, we have everything, everything.  We could be sick&mdash;you name it&mdash;but
if your name is &ldquo;<b>written in heaven</b>,&rdquo; rejoice because that is everything,
everything.  </p>

<p>Let us look at another verse.  We know that the names of the
unsaved of the world are not written there.  Their names are in the &ldquo;<b>book of
life</b>,&rdquo; but their names are not &ldquo;<b>written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life</b>.&rdquo; 
God uses both books to tell us which names are there.  So let us also look at Psalm
147:1-4.  There we read: </p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye the LORD: for <i>it is </i>good to sing praises unto
our God; for <i>it is </i>pleasant; <i>and </i>praise is comely. The LORD doth
build up Jerusalem&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the spiritual Jerusalem of God.</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the
broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He telleth the number of the
stars; he calleth them all by <i>their </i>names.</p>

<p>Is He speaking about the stars in Heaven?  Of course not. 
The true believers in the Bible are also known as stars.  We know that Christ
is &ldquo;<b>the bright and morning star,</b>&rdquo; but the true believers are also known
as stars.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he calleth them all by <i>their </i>names. </p>

<p>God saves us individually, &ldquo;<b>he calleth them all by <i>their
</i>names</b>.&rdquo;  Do you see how He has known us?</p>

<p>Let us now look at Daniel 12.  In Daniel 12:1, this is speaking
of Christ.  God tells us: </p>

<p class="verse">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble,
such as never was since there was a nation <i>even </i>to that same time: and
at that time thy people&hellip;  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
the book.  </p>

<p>This is &ldquo;<b>the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life</b>&rdquo; where all the names
of God&rsquo;s people are written.  It is not a literal book, but we are there. 
Remember, we were elected &ldquo;<b>before the foundation of the world</b>.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>Then Daniel 12:2 says:</p>

<p class="verse">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame <i>and </i>everlasting
contempt.  </p>

<p>We know this is going to be happening May 21.  There is
going to be a resurrection of everyone.  The true believers are going to be &ldquo;<b>caught
up</b>&rdquo; to be with Christ, and the unsaved are going to be here to take the &ldquo;<b>shame
and everlasting contempt</b>&rdquo; for five months.   </p>

<p>Then Daniel 12:3 says: </p>

<p class="verse">And they that be wise&hellip;</p>

<p>This is speaking about the true believers.  Are we called
wise because we have an I.Q. of 100?  No.  It is &ldquo;<b>the holy scriptures, which
are able to make thee wise unto salvation</b>.&rdquo;  When we become a child of God,
spiritually, we become wise.  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and
ever.  </p>

<p>This is speaking about the true believers.  We are also known
as stars and we are going to &ldquo;<b>shine</b>&hellip;<b>for ever and ever</b>.&rdquo;  So we
can see the security that we have in Christ and that we are going to be forever
with Him.  How wonderful this is!  </p>

<p>This day is almost here.  We have a little over twenty
months to go, and then we are going to be with Christ, in the fullest sense of
the word.  We will receive our glorified bodies and we will be with Him forevermore. 
Yet God goes on to tell us that if we are not a child of God, we do not have this
security.  </p>

<p>What does the world trust in?  The world trusts in money.  People
want to be financially secure.  This is what the world wants.  All of these
temporary things that we can see are what the unsaved of the world trusts in. 
This is their lot.  This is their home.  What makes them happy are the things
of this life: what they have or do not have, their homes, their boats, their
cars.  They just love all of this.  This is their home, but they fail to
realize that, very shortly, all this is going to be destroyed.  It is going to
be destroyed because &ldquo;<b>all <i>is </i>vanity</b>.&rdquo; <b> </b>It is nothing.  </p>

<p>So when we try to tell the unsaved of this world that this
world is going to be destroyed shortly, he is in denial.  He does not want to face
the fact that we are at the end of the world.  Whether they like it or not, we
are headed very quickly towards that day.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Psalm 49 where God tells us a little bit
about this.  This is the inheritance of the unsaved.  This is their lot.  In
Psalm 49:6-7, it says:</p>

<p class="verse">They that trust in their wealth&hellip;  </p>

<p>And who is this?  These are the unsaved of the world.  They
trust in their monies, their accounts, in whatever they have.  </p>

<p class="verse">They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches; None <i>of them </i>can by any means redeem his
brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:  </p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s riches are meaningless.  They are empty.  </p>

<p>Let us go to verses 16-18 of this same chapter.  God is
telling the true believers in Psalm 49:16-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
house is increased; For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away&hellip;  </p>

<p>Have you ever been to a funeral where you saw someone in the
coffin who was able to bring all of his wealth and all of his possessions with
him to the grave?  No, it is all left behind.  What good is it in the day of
his death?  Can it save him?  No.  </p>

<p>So if you are a child of God, you should not envy these
people in the world when you see that their possessions are multiplied, &ldquo;Yet here
I am eating beans and rice everyday.&rdquo;  No, this ought not to be our concern.  </p>

<p>Here God is telling us: </p>

<p class="verse">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
house is increased; For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory
shall not descend after him. Though while he lived he blessed his soul&hellip;  </p>

<p>He lived in luxury all his life.    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and <i>men </i>will praise thee, when thou doest well to
thyself.  </p>

<p>Then God says in verses 19-20, Psalm 49:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
see light.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;light&rdquo; here is referring to Christ.  Unsaved man
is dead forever.  What good did his wealth do him while he lived?  </p>

<p class="verse">Man <i>that is </i>in honour, and understandeth not&hellip;  </p>

<p>He does not understand, because Christ is our understanding.
 He was never &ldquo;<b>born again</b>.&rdquo;  Therefore, he &ldquo;<b>understandeth not</b>.&rdquo; 
He:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;is like the beasts <i>that </i>perish.  </p>

<p>He dies like an animal.  When an animal dies, they cease to
exist; and so here God is comparing those who are not saved to an animal.  They
die and that is it.  Both in body and soul, they died and they are going to be
thrown out of their graves come May 21, after which they will be destroyed forever. 
</p>

<p>So you see, mankind&rsquo;s worldly riches mean nothing.  In the
world in which we live, people are judged by their success in life, what they
have or do not have.  However, if they do not have Christ, they have nothing,
nothing whatsoever.  </p>

<p>Let us now look at 1 Timothy 6:7 where God tells us:</p>

<p class="verse">For we brought nothing into <i>this </i>world, <i>and it is </i>certain
we can carry nothing out.  </p>

<p>You will leave this world with nothing.  The things of this
world are empty.  They do not truly satisfy, but yet the heart of man wants
more.  He wants more and it never ends.  </p>

<p>However, when God has truly saved us, we have it all.  We
are secure in Him and we are going to &ldquo;<b>reign with him</b>,&rdquo; the Bible says, &ldquo;<b>for
ever and ever</b>.&rdquo;  This world &ldquo;<b>shall not be remembered, nor come into mind</b>&rdquo;
any longer.  </p>

<p>God goes on to tell us&mdash;actually, He goes overboard to tell us&mdash;just
how safe we are in Him.  Over and over, especially when we read through the
Psalms, we can see how God has repeatedly told us that if we are in Him, that
God indwells us.  It goes on to tell us that no one can snatch us out of His
hand.  God just goes on and on to tell us how secure we are in Him and that we
are in Him forevermore.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Psalm 119.  God is going to give us more
information.  In Psalm 119:121-122, it says:</p>

<p class="verse">I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
oppressors. Be surety for thy servant for good&hellip;  </p>

<p>Christ was made a surety for us.  We cannot get any more
secure than this.  Christ became a surety for all of His elect.  </p>

<p>Let us look also in 1 John 3:23-24.  These are beautiful
verses.  All of the verses of the Bible are beautiful, but here it says: </p>

<p class="verse">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And
he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him&hellip;  </p>

<p>How do we keep His commandments?  We keep His commandments by
being obedient to Him.  </p>

<p class="verse">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
him&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is good to read this several times.  The first time I
read this, it just hit me.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
given us.  </p>

<p>I think this is a beautiful verse that tells us that God
indwells us, &ldquo;<b>He </b><b>abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath given us</b>.&rdquo; 
God indwells us.  What more security do we need?  Almighty God, the Creator of
all things, indwells the true believers.  How wonderful that is!  </p>

<p>He goes on to give us more information in the Psalms.  He also
tells us that Christ is our &ldquo;<b>hiding place</b>.&rdquo;  He uses all these phrases
to tell us how safe and secure we are in Him.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 32:6-11, we read:</p>

<p class="verse">For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not
come nigh unto him.</p>

<p>This is referring to the Day of Judgment.  When God speaks of
water in the Bible, it can also be used to indicate judgment.  In the Day of
Judgment, they will not come close to the true believers because we are safe in
 Christ.  We are going to be &ldquo;<b>caught up</b>&rdquo; on that day. </p>

<p class="verse">Thou <i>art </i>my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
trouble&hellip;  </p>

<p>What trouble is this referring to?  This is referring to the
Day of Judgment.  Do you see how we are preserved in Him?  He is our &ldquo;<b>hiding
place</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. I
will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide
thee with mine eye.</p>

<p>God guides the life of the child of God through this world.</p>

<p class="verse">Be ye not as the horse, <i>or </i>as the mule, <i>which </i>have
no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they
come near unto thee. Many sorrows <i>shall be </i>to the wicked: but he that
trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in the LORD, and
rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all <i>ye that are </i>upright in
heart.  </p>

<p>We are &ldquo;<b>upright in heart</b>&rdquo; because Christ has given us
&ldquo;<b>a new heart</b>.&rdquo;  Therefore, we should rejoice because God has given us
the confidence and the security that we are His and that He will not lose one
of us.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Psalm 119 again.  In Psalm 119:113-116, we
read: </p>

<p class="verse">I hate <i>vain </i>thoughts: but thy law do I love. Thou <i>art </i>my
hiding place and my shield&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see how God introduced another word?  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and my shield: I hope in thy word. Depart from me, ye evildoers:
for I will keep the commandments of my God. Uphold me according unto thy word,
that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  </p>

<p>God just goes on and on to tell us how safe we are.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 117, Psalm 119:117:</p>

<p class="verse">Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who is doing the holding and who is making us safe?  It is
God Himself.</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 46, He tells us that He is &ldquo;<b>our refuge</b>.&rdquo; 
Let us also look at Psalm 46:1-5:</p>

<p class="verse">God <i>is </i>our refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;<i> Though </i>the waters
thereof roar <i>and </i>be troubled, <i>though </i>the mountains shake with the
swelling thereof. Selah.<i> There is </i>a river, the streams whereof shall
make glad the city of God, the holy <i>place </i>of the tabernacles of the most
High. God <i>is </i>in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help
her, <i>and that </i>right early.  </p>

<p>Then He says in verses 6-7, Psalm 46:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
voice, the earth melted. The LORD of hosts <i>is </i>with us; the God of Jacob <i>is
</i>our refuge. Selah.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>The LORD of hosts <i>is </i>with us</b>.&rdquo;  We are safe
with Him forevermore.  </p>

<p>Let us now look at Proverbs 14:26-27:</p>

<p class="verse">In the fear of the LORD <i>is </i>strong confidence: and his
children shall have a place of refuge.  </p>

<p>This place is referring to Christ Himself.</p>

<p class="verse">The fear of the LORD <i>is </i>a fountain of life, to depart
from the snares of death.  </p>

<p>Here He tells us that Christ is our refuge.  We go to Him
for safety.  God tells us in the New Testament to &ldquo;<b>flee from the wrath to
come</b>.&rdquo;  And whom do we flee to?  We flee to Christ for safety and for
refuge.  We do not flee to the men of this world.  We flee to Christ, because
He is our safety.  For those who do not have Christ, they have nothing.  </p>

<p>Let us look also at Psalm 62:5-8:</p>

<p class="verse">My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <i>is </i>from
him. He only <i>is </i>my rock and my salvation: <i>he is </i>my defence; I shall
not be moved. In God <i>is </i>my salvation and my glory: the rock of my
strength, <i>and </i>my refuge, <i>is </i>in God. Trust in him at all times; <i>ye

</i>people, pour out your heart before him: God <i>is </i>a refuge for us.
Selah.  </p>

<p>We could look at verse after verse after verse where God
goes on to give us an abundance of information in the Bible that no matter what
happens to us, we are safe in Christ.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a couple of other verses.  In Psalm 9:9-12,
we read:</p>

<p class="verse">The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
times of trouble. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. Sing praises to the LORD,
which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. When he maketh
inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the
humble.  </p>

<p>God goes on to tell us the beauty of this, which is that our
security in Christ goes on forevermore.</p>

<p>Let us look at one last verse.  He tells us in Proverbs 1:33:</p>

<p class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me&hellip;   </p>

<p>The only way that we are going to hearken to God&mdash;the only
way that we are going to listen and hearken unto Him&mdash;is when we listen with an
ear to being obedient unto Him.  </p>

<p class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil.  </p>

<p>Judgment Day also is a &ldquo;<b>great evil</b>&rdquo; which is coming
upon the world pretty soon, and we are safe from this.  Because Christ paid for
our sins on our behalf, the true believers are safe from this.  </p>

<p>Thee question is whether or not you are safe from that Day? 
Who and what are you trusting in?  Are you trusting in the things of this
life?  Do you trust in man?  There is no hope in man.  If you are not trusting
in God, if He is not your Saviour, if He is not your refuge, if He is not your
security, then you have nothing.   </p>

<p>(There was no question/answer session pertaining to this
study.)  </p>
