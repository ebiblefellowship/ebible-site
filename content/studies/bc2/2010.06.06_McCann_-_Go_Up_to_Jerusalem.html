<p>Please turn to Ezra 1.  Ezra is the book that comes after 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> Chronicles, and 2 Chronicles 36 ends with a lead-in to the
book of Ezra.  The first several verses that we read in Ezra are very similar
to the ending of 2 Chronicles 36.  We read in Ezra 1:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
JEHOVAH by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, JEHOVAH stirred up the
spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
kingdom, and <i>put it </i>also in writing, saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of
Persia, JEHOVAH God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and
he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which <i>is </i>in
Judah. Who <i>is there </i>among you of all his people? his God be with him,
and let him go up to Jerusalem, which <i>is </i>in Judah, and build the house
of JEHOVAH God of Israel, (he <i>is </i>the God,) which <i>is </i>in Jerusalem.
And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his
place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts,
beside the freewill offering for the house of God that <i>is </i>in Jerusalem. Then
rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and
the Levites, with all <i>them </i>whose spirit God had raised, to go up to
build the house of JEHOVAH which <i>is </i>in Jerusalem. And all they that <i>were

</i>about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with
goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all <i>that </i>was
willingly offered.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This chapter, especially, is dealing with the end of the
70-year period of Israel&rsquo;s time of bondage, their time of tribulation, as God
raised up the Babylonians, headed by King Nebuchadnezzar, to destroy Judah, to
destroy Jerusalem, and to bring the Jews into captivity into Babylon.  This is
what happened.  </p>

<p>Cyrus was a king of the Medes and the Persians and he is the
one who then conquered Babylon.  We read about this in the book of Daniel.  In Daniel
5, we read of a king who saw the handwriting on the wall.  Daniel was called to
interpret it.  When he did interpret it, it was statements that God had given
pronouncing the judgment and condemnation of Babylon and stating that they
would be destroyed.  Actually, this very night, after Daniel did, by God&rsquo;s
grace and God&rsquo;s wisdom, interpret the writing on the wall, the king of Babylon
was slain and the Medes and the Persians took this kingdom.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that this took place in this king&rsquo;s first
year, as we read in Daniel 9:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus&hellip;    </p>

<p>This reference to Darius is really referring to Cyrus.  They
are one and the same.  There are not two different kings of Persia that are in
view here.  Later on, there will be additional kings whom the Bible speaks
about; but it says in Daniel 5:30-31:  </p>

<p class="verse">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And
Darius the Median took the kingdom, <i>being </i>about threescore and two years
old.  </p>

<p>So this is the Darius that Daniel is referring to in Daniel
9:1.  Daniel goes on to say in Daniel 9:2 that he then understood the 70 years
that Jeremiah the prophet had written about.  </p>

<p>Why did Daniel understand this?  He understood because it
was the end of the Babylonian captivity and Jeremiah had written that they
would be in this predicament for 70 years.  </p>

<p>So now, Cyrus, or Darius as he is also known, comes along. 
In his first year, he gives a decree.  He makes a proclamation that Israel is
to be set free.  They can leave their bondage.  They can actually leave Babylon
and return to the land of Judah.  Not only this, not only did he set them free,
but he commands them to build the house of God, to raise up the house that was
destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C.  Even more than this, he gives them
treasures of gold and silver and goods in order that they can accomplish this
and build the house of God.  </p>

<p>At the end of Daniel 6, which is the chapter where this same
Cyrus or Darius cast Daniel into the lion&rsquo;s den, we read in Daniel 6:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
reign of Cyrus the Persian.  </p>

<p>Instead of the word &ldquo;and,&rdquo; this should have been translated &ldquo;even.&rdquo; 
This makes a difference:  </p>

<p class="verse">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, [<i>even</i>]
in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.  </p>

<p>That is, they were one and the same.  They were not two
kings by two different names.  This was referring to one king.  It could be
that Darius was a title, like Pharaoh or Caesar.  However the Lord willed, He
could call him Cyrus or He could call him Darius, but He was still speaking
about the same person.  </p>

<p>So we can see that Cyrus was very favorable to the Jews. 
For example, just look at what happened with the prophet Daniel.  The king knew
that Daniel was a good man.  The king knew that Daniel was a faithful man
because he had already set him over 120 princes.  Of the three presidents, Daniel
was one.  Daniel was actually the chief president over all of the leaders of Babylon
and over all of the provinces of the Medes and the Persians.  Daniel was very
much appreciated by the king of the Medes and the Persians.  Daniel was even
more so after being thrown into the lion&rsquo;s pit and not being devoured by the
lions when God had shut their mouths for that whole night.  If you read the
last few verses of Daniel 6, you will see the impression that this made upon
this king.  </p>

<p>Even more than all of this, I think that Cyrus was favorable
to the Jews because of what we read in the last verse of Isaiah 44.  Isaiah
44:28 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">That saith of Cyrus, <i>He is </i>my shepherd, and shall perform
all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the
temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.  </p>

<p>So God called Cyrus His shepherd.  Whom else does God call
His shepherd in the Bible?  Who else is a shepherd?  The Lord Jesus is called &ldquo;the
good shepherd&rdquo; in the Gospel of John.  Here God is speaking of Cyrus, a heathen
king, and He is saying, &ldquo;Cyrus is my shepherd.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at the very next verse at the beginning of the next
chapter.  We read in Isaiah 45:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith JEHOVAH to his anointed, to Cyrus&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;anointed&rdquo; is translated &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; twice in the
book of Daniel where we read about the 70 weeks of Daniel 9.  </p>

<p>So God is using this very same word that He uses of the Lord
Jesus&mdash;the Messiah, the Saviour&mdash;to describe Cyrus.  Cyrus is His anointed.  Here
God is just using the name of Cyrus, but He has in view Christ.  </p>

<p>This is like other times when the Lord speaks of David and
the language can only fit the Lord Jesus Christ.  God even calls David His
shepherd, &ldquo;my servant David&hellip;he shall be their shepherd,&rdquo; and yet David was long
gone when this comment was made in the book of Ezekiel.  Ezekiel had been a
contemporary of Daniel&rsquo;s.  David had lived hundreds of years earlier, but God
referred to David because He was actually pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ. 
So God calls Christ &ldquo;David&rdquo; and He calls Him &ldquo;Cyrus.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We can be sure that Daniel or Ezekiel, who were in Babylon,
or some other believer, would have gone to Cyrus at some point; but Daniel had
the most access.  Daniel was already looked upon favorably, and so he could
have pointed out some verses in the book of Isaiah that were written at least
147 years earlier than when Cyrus had actually taken the kingdom.  The last
king whom Isaiah prophesied under had been Hezekiah.  Isaiah prophesied &ldquo;in the
days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and </i>Hezekiah, kings of Judah.&rdquo;  Hezekiah
died in 686 B.C.  When Cyrus took the kingdom, it was 539 B.C.  </p>

<p>This means that over 147 years earlier, God had written down
the name of Cyrus.  By the way, this is something that we just take for
granted.  We think, &ldquo;Well, of course.  God is God and He can do this.&rdquo;  Yes,
but He had made a very specific prophecy in Isaiah concerning a king named
Cyrus who would make a proclamation that His temple be built, and He fulfilled
it.  </p>

<p>We always need to relate these studies to May 21, 2011, because time is so short.  This, therefore, constantly has to be our focus. 
But a lot of people say, &ldquo;There have been a lot of date setters in the past and
not one of them has ever been right.&rdquo;  But this is false.  This is false. 
There have been dates set that were correct when God set them and then fulfilled
them.  </p>

<p>God set a date for the flood, did He not?  He set a date.  Then
He told Noah that it would be &ldquo;an hundred and twenty years,&rdquo; and it was.  Then He
more specifically told Noah, &ldquo;For yet seven days,&rdquo; which was a very precise
date for the year, month, and day, just like we know about May 21, 2011.  God sets dates and then He fulfills them.  So if anyone ever says to you, &ldquo;No one has
ever been right before,&rdquo; you can say, &ldquo;Yes, they have.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God also spoke through Moses and Aaron when He told the
Pharaoh directly, &ldquo;Tomorrow at this time, shall this thing be.&rdquo;  He then brought
one of the plagues on Egypt.  The next day at that time was that thing; that
plague did take place.  God has always, always fulfilled His Word.  </p>

<p>Daniel 9 is another example of a time path.  People say that
time paths are not Biblical.  They are not?  Then what are the 70 weeks of Daniel
9 that have a start date and are projected into the future by God to the coming
Messiah?  Was this not a time path?  Was this not a Biblical time path?  Yes,
it was and God fulfilled it precisely.  It can be shown from Daniel 9 that the
Lord gave these weeks.  </p>

<p>I am sure that you have read or heard of Mr. Camping&rsquo;s book,
<i>70 Weeks of </i><i>Daniel</i><i> Nine</i>.  This book shows how precise God
was to the very year that Christ would be baptized and to the very year that He
would be crucified.  It was an exact date and an exact time path that came
right from the Bible and it was correct.  </p>

<p>People like to bring up all of the other date setters who
were not correct, but the vast majority of these people were not even true
believers.  So what does this have to do with them?  If the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses
who do not have the right Gospel set a date, how does this somehow affect the
true believers who are following God&rsquo;s methodology and who worship Christ as
Savior?  How does this relate to the true believers?  </p>

<p>It is true that of all of the many dates that people like to
refer to, there have probably been a handful that were made by true believers
who were very serious about this and who tried to indicate a date but were
incorrect.  We know why this was.  It was because God sealed up the Word till
the time of the end.  He is now unsealing it and He is revealing to us His
plan.  </p>

<p>All though Biblical history, it has been a Biblical pattern
and a Biblical principle that prior to judgment, God will warn His servants: He
will warn His people.  If He did this with Sodom and Gomorrah, which was a city
of tens of thousands or maybe a couple hundred thousand including the cities of
the plain, and if He did this with the world prior to the flood of Noah&rsquo;s day,
which was a handful of a million people, and Jesus refers to these two
judgments as a type and an example of His own return, would God not take care
to warn a world of nearly seven billion?  If He was so concerned and
considerate of the Ninevites, which were one hundred and twenty thousand, would
He not be far more concerned to warn a world of seven billion people?  </p>

<p>It makes no sense to see this Biblical pattern in the Bible
where God repeatedly forewarns His people and then to think that at the great
judgment of all judgments, the end of the world, He would not follow suit and
mercifully warn His people.  Actually, He has.  He has done this.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Ezra 1.  The 70-year period of the
Babylonian captivity is in view.  Actually, it is the end of the 70 years, and
this 70-year period typified what?  It typified the Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p>There are a few figures that typify the Great Tribulation. 
The 70 years from 609 to 539 B.C. is one.  The 23-year period, inclusively,
from 609 to 587 B.C. when God destroyed the temple is another.  The seven years
of Joseph&rsquo;s famine is another type, because God said that this was great
tribulation in Acts 7 when bringing up the famine in that chapter.  The seven
months that the Ark was in the hands of the Philistines is another figure.  And
the 70 years here is typifying the end of the Great Tribulation.  </p>

<p>What comes at the end of the Great Tribulation?  When is the
end of the Great Tribulation?  It began on May 21, 1988.  It goes 23 years to May 21, 2011, which is an even and full 23-year period that is also 8400
days.  And the number 84 is related to the Great Tribulation.  If you look at
the seven-year famine in Jacob and Joseph&rsquo;s day, 7 x 12 is 84 months.  If you
look at 70 years x 12 months per year, it is 840 months.  The three and a half
days that the two witnesses are lying dead in the street is equal to 84 hours. 
</p>

<p>We see the number 84 over and over again, 84, 84, 84, and it
relates to the Great Tribulation.  God has perfectly worked out this timeline
so that the 23<sup>rd</sup> year, which concludes next May 21, is also the
exact 8400<sup>th</sup> day.  This is just more infallible proof that can go
along with the many other things that we have learned about in relation to how
God has locked this in and confirmed this.  </p>

<p>So Ezra 1 is an historical chapter where Cyrus is the king
of Persia who says that the Lord has blessed him and given him a tremendous
kingdom, and this is true of Christ.  Then Cyrus issues the proclamation, &ldquo;Go
up.  Go up to Jerusalem.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Cyrus does not say, &ldquo;Be raptured.&rdquo;  He does not say this,
but then the Bible does not say this either.  God does not even say in 1
Thessalonians 4 that when the Lord comes, He will &ldquo;rapture&rdquo; His people; so what
kind of language does God use concerning the rapture?  What is the Biblical
language concerning the rapture?  </p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 4:17 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then we which are alive <i>and </i>remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air&hellip;  </p>

<p>God uses the term &ldquo;caught up.&rdquo;  This is a very simple term. 
This is not a theological term.  This is just what God intends to do very literally. 
He plans to take His people up.  </p>

<p>Where are they going?  Where are we going?  Are we going to
Heaven?  What is another way that God speaks of this?  He refers to it as
Heaven, but what else does He call it?  </p>

<p>God really refers to it in some cases as Jerusalem, as the
Promised Land.  The Promised Land has to do with God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham that
He would give him the land for an &ldquo;everlasting possession.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Was God referring to the land in the Middle East?  Does
anyone want to dwell there everlastingly?  Does anyone even want to go there at
this time for a weekend vacation?  </p>

<p>No, no one wants to go there because there is so much
trouble there; and God is not going to give any piece of this earth as an &ldquo;everlasting
possession&rdquo; because the earth is going to burn and melt with a &ldquo;fervent heat.&rdquo; 
It is not going to be just 99% of the earth, leaving this strip of land over in
the Middle East for people to dwell on forevermore.  This is going to burn,
too.  This is also going to be destroyed.  </p>

<p>The promise to Abraham was not for a physical land, but what
the land represented, what the land typified, which is Heaven itself.  Heaven
is our &ldquo;everlasting possession,&rdquo; the new earth, which Canaan represented, where
God&rsquo;s people will dwell forevermore and live forevermore.  </p>

<p>So Cyrus, who is clearly a figure of Christ, at the end of
the 70 years issues a proclamation, &ldquo;Now you Jews, go up.  Go up to Jerusalem
and build the temple.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look also at Revelation 11:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld
them.  </p>

<p>Again, this is very simple language, &ldquo;Come up.&rdquo;  This is all
God has to say.  He does not even have to say this out loud; but for our sakes,
He does, &ldquo;You, you, you, and you, come up, My elect people.  It is time for Me,
the husbandman, to gather the precious fruit of the earth,&rdquo; and so He grabs us
under His wings and we go up, all of His people who are alive at the time of
the rapture.  </p>

<p>By the way, the only difference between the word &ldquo;rapture&rdquo;

and the word &ldquo;resurrection&rdquo; depends on whether you are living or dead.  This is
because the dead also go up.  Once God gives them a new resurrected body, they
also go up.  If you happen to be alive at this time, the theological term that
was coined is &ldquo;rapture,&rdquo; but you go up, too.  All of God&rsquo;s people go up and their
enemies behold them.  </p>

<p>The only way that the enemies of God can behold those being
raptured is if they are left behind, and so they do not go up.  They are not
gathered, which is similar to what we read about several times in the book of
Jeremiah.  They are not gathered as &ldquo;precious fruit.&rdquo;  They are the bad figs. 
They are the &ldquo;evil fruit.&rdquo;  They give forth a stench, and so they are not
collected.  They are not gathered by God.  He simply leaves them.  The unsaved
dead are left on the face of the ground, littering the earth.  Those who are
still alive but spiritually dead are also left behind for the five-month
period.  </p>

<p>But here in Ezra 1, we have God using a true historical
happening to describe in chapter one of this book the ascension of those
exiled, the going up of the people of God into Heaven immediately following the
Great Tribulation.  This will happen on May 21 of next year.  </p>

<p>Yes, but why does it say in Ezra 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who <i>is there </i>among you of all his people? his God be with
him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which <i>is </i>in Judah, and build the
house of JEHOVAH God of Israel, (he <i>is </i>the God,) which <i>is </i>in
Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>If this is truly picturing the rapture, why are they going
up to build a house?  Why would people go into Heaven to build?  Does this make
sense?  What is God saying with this?  I hope that some of you looked into
this.  I encouraged everyone last week to look up the word &ldquo;build&rdquo; in the Bible
to see what you would find.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Ezekiel 28:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; When I shall have gathered the
house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered&hellip;  </p>

<p>Where are God&rsquo;s elect found?  They are found everywhere in
the world across the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen&hellip;  </p>

<p>What did Revelation 11 say?  It said that &ldquo;their enemies
beheld them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Ezekiel 28:25 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my
servant Jacob.  </p>

<p>If you remember in Ezekiel 37, which is the chapter that
deals with dry bones, we read in Ezekiel 37:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost:
we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith
the Lord JEHOVAH; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you
to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye
shall know that I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH, when I have opened your graves, O my
people, and brought you up out of your graves,  </p>

<p>He will bring people up out of the graves and into the land
 of Israel, into the land that God speaks of as Israel or Jerusalem or Judah. 
He uses these as figures of going into Heaven.  </p>

<p>At the time that God opens up the graves, is anyone going to
then be translated into the Middle East?  No, this is foolish.  &ldquo;The whole
house of Israel&rdquo; is a reference to the whole of God&rsquo;s elect, which is probably 200
million who will be taken &ldquo;into the land,&rdquo; into the &ldquo;everlasting possession&rdquo; of
the Kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>But when God&rsquo;s people are raptured next May 21, 2011, is God
going to create a new Heaven and a new earth right then?  No, He cannot because
this world will still be here for five months.  </p>

<p>This is why we read in Revelation 7 about a &ldquo;great multitude&rdquo;
that suddenly appears in Heaven.  God wants to emphasize this, and so He has
the question asked, &ldquo;Whence came they?&rdquo;  His response is, &ldquo;These are they which
came out of great tribulation.&rdquo;  Then it says that they &ldquo;serve him day and
night in his temple.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But I thought that there was no time in Heaven.  It is
supposed to be an eternity without day and night.  Well, for five months, there
is still time.  For five months on the earth after the &ldquo;great multitude&rdquo; are
taken up out of the world on May 21, the sun in the sky will be shining.  There
will still be time for five months.  </p>

<p>We will not turn there, but we can read of this in other
places, like in the book of Job where people are entering into Heaven and time
references, such as day and so forth, are given because there is still time on
earth.  Therefore, this is a legitimate thing that God can say.  However, on
October 21, God will destroy the world and the universe and all of the
unsaved.  Then there will be no more time.  Then God&rsquo;s people will dwell in eternity
and we would never read of a time reference again because of this.  </p>

<p>Back in Ezekiel 28:25, it concludes:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my
servant Jacob. </p>

<p>This is referring to Heaven, the new Heaven and the new
earth.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezekiel 28:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and
plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed
judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall
know that I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH their God.  </p>

<p>This is referring to building houses in Heaven.  Does this
sound familiar?  Can you think of another passage where houses are being built
and it can be referring to nothing other than Heaven?  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 65.  There is no mistaking this.  Isaiah
65:17-18 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice
for ever <i>in that </i>which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and her people a joy.  </p>

<p>This is what Cyrus said, &ldquo;Go up to build the house of the
LORD which <i>is </i>in Jerusalem.&rdquo;  God is saying, &ldquo;I create new heavens and a
new earth.&rdquo;  In other words, &ldquo;I create Jerusalem.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In the book of Revelation, what came down &ldquo;prepared as a
bride adorned for her husband&rdquo;?  It was the &ldquo;new Jerusalem&rdquo; that was composed
of living stones.  This is what Peter says.  We are &ldquo;lively stones&rdquo; or living
people.  </p>

<p>All throughout time and yet very slowly for thousands of
years, God saved this one and added them to His city.  Then God saved another
one and did the same thing.  Now at the end and in a glorious way, He is going
to finish and save more in these last few years than He has all throughout
history.  This is the &ldquo;great multitude.&rdquo;  Upon salvation, all of them are added
as living stones in a beautiful house.  These are those whom He refers to as
His Bride, but He also identifies them as &ldquo;new Jerusalem.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In Hebrews 3, there is a statement made.  Look at Hebrews
3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For every house is builded by some <i>man; </i>but he that built
all things <i>is </i>God.  </p>

<p>Now look at verse 6, Hebrews 3:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are the house of God: &ldquo;we,&rdquo; not everyone, not every human
being, but God&rsquo;s people.  We are His chosen.  </p>

<p>What does He call His people?  How does He even identify
them in some places?  He calls them &ldquo;the Israel of God&rdquo;; and Cyrus is making a
proclamation to the Jews, &ldquo;go up&hellip;and build the house.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Spiritually, this is referring to the rapture, the ascension
of the exiles, as all of God&rsquo;s people are cast out.  We are not in the
churches.  We are not in Babylon.  We are set free from Babylon, and now God is
going to gather His chosen ones and save them.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Isaiah 65.  We read in Isaiah 65:19-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. There
shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled
his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <i>being
</i>an hundred years old shall be accursed. And they shall build houses, and
inhabit <i>them; </i>and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
</p>

<p>This is referring to the new Heaven and the new earth, but
we do not have to take this literally.  We are not going up into Heaven and being
given a hammer and nails as soon as we get there.  This is not what God has in
mind.  He actually uses the reverse language to teach something very important
about this world and about the curse of sin upon this world.  He says in
Deuteronomy, as well as in other places, &ldquo;thou shalt build an house, and thou
shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the
grapes thereof.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because this is the nature of this world.  Nothing
that we do lasts.  It is literally building castles in the sand.   We laugh at
children when they go to the beach and spend a long time building something
when very shortly, maybe not that day, maybe the next day, a wave comes in and
it is all gone.  </p>

<p>This is a good analogy of your life and my life and the life
of every single person.  This is because no matter what you are working for or
striving towards, you are going to lose it.  This is guaranteed.  </p>

<p>Yes, it is difficult realizing that we have less than a year
left, but what is going to happen May 21 of next year is guaranteed to happen
to you if the world were to continue indefinitely.  This is guaranteed to
happen to you and to me and to every single human being.  </p>

<p>If you have a family, you are going to lose them.  They are
going to die.  If you have property, eventually, maybe not you, but a child of
yours will lose the property.  If you have money, it can buy things but those
things will not last.  </p>

<p>We are all guaranteed a miserable end if we go after this
world.  This is why God tells us not to be taken in by the world with all of
its beauty and glamour and what it appears to promise.  It is all a big, fat
lie.  There is nothing in this world that is worth anything more than the bowl
of porridge that Esau sold his birthright for.  You are selling yours yourself
if you think that you are going to continue in this world and if you are going after
the things of this life and not paying any attention to May 21 of 2011.  </p>

<p>People think, &ldquo;I can just ignore this and it will just go
away, because it is not true.&rdquo;  It is not?  What do they base this on?  Upon what
do they base their statement that this is not going to happen, that this is not
going to take place?  What is this based upon?  Is it based upon their own
feelings or their own understanding?  Who are they?  Who is anyone who says, &ldquo;No,
I know better.  I know better than God.  I will see you on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>Okay, that is their prophecy.  But God&rsquo;s prophecy from the
Bible, which comes from the infinite and eternal mind of God, is that they may
indeed be here on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.  If they are, they are going to see a
world that will be very different than the world that they see today, very
different than the world that has ever been.  At that time, their jobs will be
worthless.  Their family relationships&mdash;their relationship with their husband or
with their wife or with their children&mdash;all of this will be meaningless because
they will know that there is an end.  The earthquake will have happened and God
will have taken His people.  Maybe they will live for another five months, but
that will be it.  That will be it.  That will be all there is.  </p>

<p>Some people go along with their own thinking or with the
thinking of their friends, with the opinion of the crowd, with those who smirk
and lift their eyebrows, with those who do this kind of thing and ask, &ldquo;You
mean that you actually believe this?&rdquo;  But is this kind of statement alone
enough to dissuade you from everlasting life?  Are you really going to follow
the opinion of a few friends who have no more intelligence than you?  </p>

<p>Well, let us return to Ezra 1.  We read again in Ezra
1:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and
the priests, and the Levites, with all <i>them </i>whose spirit God had raised,
to go up to build the house of JEHOVAH which <i>is </i>in Jerusalem. And all
they that <i>were </i>about them strengthened their hands with vessels of
silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside
all <i>that </i>was willingly offered.  </p>

<p>This should remind us of something.  This is very similar to
the exodus.  Do you remember the exodus after God had brought those plagues upon
  Egypt?  We read in Exodus 12:35-36:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
raiment: And JEHOVAH gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so
that they lent unto them <i>such things as they required. </i>And they spoiled
the Egyptians.  </p>

<p>Here in Exodus when Israel was leaving, God gave the
Israelites favor in the sight of the Egyptian people who then gave them their
gold, silver, and other goods.  Their attitude toward the Israelites was
probably, &ldquo;Get out of here.  Leave us.  Please, go quickly,&rdquo; because God had
basically destroyed the greatest empire upon the face of the earth over the
course of these plagues.  </p>

<p>The leaving of Egypt, in a sense, was a picture of
salvation, yes; but since it was a mass of Israelites, hundreds of thousands of
people, it could also typify God&rsquo;s people leaving this world, and they were
given gold and silver and precious things.  </p>

<p>This was just like when the Jews found favor in their provinces
once Cyrus came into power and they also gave the Jewish people gold and silver
and beasts.  This points to the victory that God&rsquo;s people win at the end of
time and that God gets Himself victory.  He will prevail.  </p>

<p>This is as we read in the book of Genesis.  After Noah and
his family went into the ark and God shut the door, which represents May 21,
then &ldquo;the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth&hellip;fifteen cubits upward did
the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.&rdquo;  This is referring to the
Word of God, the Gospel, which is victorious.  It will be shown to be
victorious for the five months, as all of the people left behind will realize
that the Word of God was true and that all that they heard about this was
true.  </p>

<p>Remember also when Jehoshaphat led his army to &ldquo;the watch
tower in the wilderness&rdquo; as the enemy was coming against them, this was a
figure of the battle of Armageddon at the end of time.  They ended up killing
themselves.  When Judah got there and saw all of the dead bodies, they did not
have to fight in the battle.  Instead, they went and they gathered the spoil,
because this was what God was picturing for His people, the spoil of a new
earth.  We read that &ldquo;the meek shall inherit the earth,&rdquo; but not this earth,
the new earth.  This is the victory that God has in view and this is why they
were given gold and silver and precious things.  </p>

<p>Then Ezra 1:7-11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of JEHOVAH,
which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in
the house of his gods; Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the
hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the
prince of Judah. And this <i>is </i>the number of them: thirty chargers of
gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, Thirty basins of
gold, silver basins of a second <i>sort </i>four hundred and ten, <i>and </i>other
vessels a thousand. All the vessels of gold and of silver <i>were </i>five
thousand and four hundred. All <i>these </i>did Sheshbazzar bring up with <i>them
of </i>the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>We know that gold and silver can typify believers if we look
at Zechariah 13.  We read in Zechariah 13:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that </i>in all the land, saith JEHOVAH,
two parts therein shall be cut off <i>and </i>die; but the third shall be left
therein. And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them
as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my
name, and I will hear them: I will say, It <i>is </i>my people: and they shall say,
JEHOVAH <i>is </i>my God.  </p>

<p>Here God likens gold and silver that goes through the fire
as being His people.  </p>

<p>So in Ezra 1, Cyrus makes a proclamation.  He gathers the
vessels that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away.  In a sense,
he is freeing them also to return to where they belong, which is back to Jerusalem
and, ultimately, back to the temple of God.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Corinthians 3, which kind of brings these two
ideas of building and gold and silver together.  We read in 1 Corinthians 3:9: 
</p>

<p class="verse">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God&rsquo;s husbandry&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Again, this points to God using this picture of us being
like fruit.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>ye are </i>God&rsquo;s building.  </p>

<p>This is another picture that God uses, as we read earlier, &ldquo;whose
house are we.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues in 1 Corinthians 3:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no
man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon
this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every man&rsquo;s
work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be
revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man&rsquo;s work of what sort it is.  </p>

<p>Gold, silver, and precious stones make it through the fire
and are actually purified.  Wood, hay, and stubble will not make it through the
fire.  These are going to be burned up.  </p>

<p>So God is here referring to the day of fire that shall
reveal the kind of work that you and I are.  Are we &ldquo;gold, silver, precious
stones&rdquo; or are we &ldquo;wood, hay, stubble&rdquo;?  Are we &ldquo;wheat&rdquo; or are we &ldquo;tares&rdquo;?  Are
we &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; or are we &ldquo;goats&rdquo;?   </p>

<p>What day is going to reveal this?  May 21 of next year will ultimately
and finally reveal this because the &ldquo;gold, silver, precious stones&rdquo; will be
taken up and the &ldquo;wood, hay, stubble&rdquo; will be left behind.  </p>

<p>God speaks of the &ldquo;day of judgment&rdquo; as a single day, but it
is a five-month period concluding on October 21 with the &ldquo;lake of fire.&rdquo;  It is
in the &ldquo;lake of fire&rdquo; that everything that God created&mdash;the world, the universe,
and all of the unsaved who are left behind&mdash;are cast into.  But this fire
actually begins, in a spiritual sense but also in a very real way, on May 21,
which is the day that will determine that anyone left behind will be guaranteed
to finally burn.  </p>

<p>This is what is in view in Ezra 1.  King Cyrus is a type of Christ
and he has taken the vessels out of the temple of Babylon.  It was like he was
translating them out of the kingdom of darkness and &ldquo;into the kingdom of his
dear Son.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Ezra is a book that gets into a lot of numbers.  Did you
know that critics and skeptics of the Bible&mdash;enemies, really, of God and of the
Bible; because if you are enemy of the Bible, you are an enemy of God&mdash;like to
go to the book of Ezra because there are numbers there that do not match up
with another account in the book of Nehemiah?  </p>

<p>Ezra 2 gets into this.  We are not going to read this today,
but it lists 42 people groups besides Zerubbabel and the men who came up with
him.  Forty-two groups of people are listed.  But over in Nehemiah where it says
that he &ldquo;found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first,&rdquo;
he lays out the same list and there are only 40 groups mentioned there.  There
are numerous apparent contradictions or discrepancies from the list in Ezra
compared to the list in Nehemiah.  </p>

<p>I used to work as a counselor in an alcohol and drug rehab
center.  One of the counselors was a psychiatrist whom we all ultimately
reported to.  At this time, I was just getting into the Bible and I think that
I had let it be known that I had wanted to go to seminary in order to become a Christian
counselor.  He knew that I read the Bible, and so one day he said to me, &ldquo;You
know that you cannot trust the Bible; it is full of errors.&rdquo;  At the time, I
really did not know what to say.  I knew that this was not true and that this
was not correct, but he made this statement and he probably did so because he
might have been familiar with the book of Ezra.  Ezra is a book that skeptics
often go to in order to try to show that the Bible is not correct.  </p>

<p>We read something in Ezra 1:7-11 and I am wondering if
anyone noticed any problem in what we read about the gold and silver?  God
numbered them, did He not?  He said in Ezra 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar&hellip;    </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezra 1:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And this <i>is </i>the number of them: thirty chargers of gold&hellip; 
  </p>

<p>I will not read all of this again at this time, but if you
add up verses 9 and 10, it comes to 2,499, as far as the count that God gives. 
But if you look at Ezra 1:11, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">All the vessels of gold and of silver <i>were </i>five thousand
and four hundred&hellip;  </p>

<p>There is a difference here of 2,901.  One reason that God
did this was because the number 2,499 breaks down into 3 x 7 x 7 x 17.  We have
been seeing that this has to do with the rapture.  Number 3 represents that
this is God&rsquo;s purpose.  Then He doubles up the number 7.  This means that it is
His purpose that when we come to the end, He will make His people perfect, as
the number 7 deals with perfection; and that they will go up to Heaven,
represented by the number 17.  For God&rsquo;s own purposes, He counted out all of
the vessels that were in the house of the Babylonian gods that Nebuchadnezzar
had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem; and so there is also the number
5,400.  </p>

<p>But this is what is claimed by those who go to the Bible
superficially and who just read the surface meaning or the plain and literal
meaning of the Bible.  Actually, some of them can be more thorough, but these
are people who are really looking for errors in the Bible.  However, God&rsquo;s
people realize that there are no errors.  There are no mistakes.  There are no
real contradictions.  There are apparent contradictions, but there are no
actual contradictions.  If these people are in the church and they are
skeptics, they say that there was a scribal error.  If they are in the world,
they just say that we cannot trust the Bible.  </p>

<p>The answer is that there were 2,499 pieces of gold and
silver that came out of the house of the Babylonian gods that Nebuchadnezzar
had removed from Jerusalem.  But we read earlier about the people of the
provinces, the people who were in other places, when God, through Cyrus, issued
a proclamation, &ldquo;Go up and let the men of your place help you with silver, and
with gold, and with goods, and with beasts.&rdquo;  This is where the other pieces of
gold and silver came from.  It was not counted out, but it was there.  These
men also returned with Zerubbabel and Jeshua and with the exiles who were
leaving Babylon.  These all went back to Jerusalem, and so the total number of
silver and gold was 5,400.  </p>

<p>It is really very simple and, normally, a lot of
contradictions are.  Let us just look at one that you may be familiar with.  2
Samuel 24 is a chapter that deals with David numbering Israel.  Normally when
we understand how God wrote the Bible and that it is perfect without error and
without mistake, then we are led to check deeper and further to try to come up
with answers.  But if someone just does not want to believe the Bible, then
they are satisfied with these kinds of statements.  </p>

<p>We read in 2 Samuel 24:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem
at the end of nine months and twenty days.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of Joab who David had ordered to number the
people.  Then we read in 2 Samuel 24:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the
sword; and the men of Judah <i>were </i>five hundred thousand men.  </p>

<p>Compare this to 1 Chronicles 21:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
And all <i>they of </i>Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
men&hellip;  </p>

<p>This would be 1,100,000 men.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that drew sword: and Judah <i>was </i>four hundred threescore
and ten thousand men that drew sword.  </p>

<p>Do you see any difference?  If you would read earlier in
this chapter, you would see that this is the same exact historical situation. 
This is the result of Joab going to number the people.  </p>

<p>What was the difference between the number of Israel and Judah? 
In 2 Samuel 24, God numbers Israel at 800,000 men and Judah at 500,000 men. 
Here in 1 Chronicles 21, He is numbering Israel at 1,100,000 men or 300,000
more, and He is numbering Judah at 470,000 men or 30,000 less.  Actually, this
is interesting because it was 300,000 more of Israel and 30,000 less of Judah, and
both indicate the numbers 3 and 10 or God&rsquo;s purpose (3) regarding completeness
(10) of whatever is in view.  I do not fully know what is in view here, but we
do see this number.  </p>

<p>So is there a mistake?  Is there an error?  What do you
think?  No, there is no mistake.  Actually, when we learn and understand what
God did here, we stand impressed.  We actually begin to respect the Bible as it
ought to be, which is as the perfect document that it is and that it is without
error.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Chronicles 27:23-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and
under: because JEHOVAH had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of
the heavens. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in
the account of the chronicles of king David.  </p>

<p>And this had the lesser number of Judah.  There were 470,000
in the account of 1 Chronicles.  There were 500,000 in the account of 2 Samuel
24.  What happened?  What went wrong?  </p>

<p>Yes, this pointed to David&rsquo;s pride because he wanted to
number Israel.  But a further mistake that David made was giving the task to
Joab, that evil man.  We read a lot about him in the Bible.  He was a very
wicked man.  Even though he sounded holy as he was talking to David when he had
asked him why he wanted to number Israel and then he brought up God, he was a
wicked man who did not hesitate to stab someone beneath the fifth rib.  We can
read a lot about Joab in the Bible and his deceitfulness.  </p>

<p>So as Joab was numbering, he did something very wrong.  He
included in his number young men who were beneath the age of twenty.  In the
military draft system in our country, one has to be eighteen.  An individual
who is under this age cannot be drafted into the military.  </p>

<p>God also had a law, if you remember.  In the wilderness,
they counted the men &ldquo;twenty years old and above.&rdquo;  Beneath twenty, they were
not counted.  I guess that the Lord still looks at them as young people or even
children; I am not sure why.  </p>

<p>The key reference is found when you read these numbers and
it mentions &ldquo;men that drew the sword.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Drew the sword&rdquo; is a reference that
means that they are old enough to pull a sword and to fight in a war.  </p>

<p>In the other account in 1 Chronicles 21:5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and Judah <i>was </i>four hundred threescore and ten thousand
men that drew sword.  </p>

<p>This is saying that there were 470,000 men who were twenty
years old or above.  But 2 Samuel 24:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the men of Judah <i>were </i>five hundred thousand men.  </p>

<p>This does not men that they &ldquo;drew the sword.&rdquo;  They did not
draw the sword because Joab included 30,000 young people.  Joab included 30,000
under the age of twenty, and wrath fell because of it.  </p>

<p>There was a lot wrapped up in this sin, including David&rsquo;s
pride; however, he did take nine months and twenty days to do this.  All along,
Joab was numbering the people.  If God had wanted to make a point about David&rsquo;s
pride, He could have done this at an earlier date.  But Joab began to do
wickedly and to do something unbiblical, something that God did not like.  He
was counting the teenagers of Judah and this was wrong, and so this number was
not put into the account.  </p>

<p>And now we see the accuracy, the exactness, the precision of
the Word of God, even with a term like &ldquo;drew the sword&rdquo; in relation to how many
did and how many did not.  In 1 Chronicles 27, God perfectly explains this.  </p>

<p>Was there a contradiction or was there a failure on our part
to know enough about the Bible?  It was a failure on our part.  We did not
fully understand what God was doing.  </p>

<p>Lord willing, next week, we will look a little bit more at
David&rsquo;s command to number, because there are seemingly other contradictions
there.  Then we will go back to Ezra and Nehemiah in comparing them.  Please
read Ezra and Nehemiah.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Ezra, I will just show you one thing and
then we will close.  In Ezra 2, from really the first verse until about verse
60, numbers are given.  In Ezra when you add up all of the people who are
mentioned, it comes to 29,818.  In Nehemiah when you add them all up, it comes
to 31,000+, and so there is an apparent discrepancy there.  </p>

<p>But more than this, look at Ezra 2:64:  </p>

<p class="verse">The whole congregation together <i>was </i>forty and two
thousand three hundred <i>and </i>threescore,  </p>

<p>So this is 42,360.  Where did this number come from?  God
gave us all of the numbers; but when we add them up, it seems to be about
12,000 short from the total.  </p>

<p>This one is easy, and so we will just finish with this.  If we
look at Ezra 2:2, it says in the last part of the verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;The number of the men of the people of Israel:  </p>

<p>Then in Ezra 2:64, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The whole congregation together <i>was </i>forty and two
thousand three hundred <i>and </i>threescore,  </p>

<p>Was there any difference?  What did God do?  God does this
in order to let people go their own way.  If anyone wants to turn their back on
the Bible, they can read these verses and then they can turn away from God and
turn towards the world.  At least to themselves, they believe that they can be
confident that they do not have to worry about May 21 or about anything that a
booklet says, because there are errors in the Bible.  </p>

<p>Well, God is the One who wrote the Bible this way in order
to allow this and to even foster this.  Of course, not one of His elect would
ever dare do this because we understand how God wrote the Bible.  The Bible is
one big test throughout.  All the way through the Bible, it is a severe test
for man.  Do we believe it?  God tells us, &ldquo;Trust in JEHOVAH with all thine
heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&rdquo;  Trust Him.  Trust His
Word.  </p>

<p>Do you know the answer in relation to these two verses that
we just looked at?  The last part of Ezra 2:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;The number of the men of the people of Israel:    </p>

<p>And Ezra 2:64 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The whole congregation together&hellip;  </p>

<p>The answer is pretty obvious.  In Ezra 2:2, He only counted
the men.  There were 29,818 men, but there were also the women, the wives and
the children, or &ldquo;the whole congregation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The thing that we really have to try to solve, by God&rsquo;s
grace, is how can there be different numbers in Nehemiah from Ezra when he came
up with over 31,000 men and it says there that Nehemiah counted the men also. 
So this is the real question, but the number of the whole congregation is the
same identical number in both books.  It is 42,000+, and so this is exact and
correct; it is just that this number includes the women and children.  </p>

<p>Some people have commented, &ldquo;You have so many men but very
few women.&rdquo;  Yes, this is true, but remember that this was a perilous journey. 
This journey took Ezra several months to leave Babylon.  He left on the &ldquo;first <i>day
</i>of the first month&rdquo; and he got there on &ldquo;first <i>day </i>of the fifth
month.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This was a perilous time.  Jerusalem had no walls about
them, and so they had no protection, no safety.  I can see many men saying to
their wives, &ldquo;I am going to go up and work hard and it is no place for a woman.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Of course, today, this statement might be problematic.  But
for most of history, this was the thinking of the world.  This was no place for
a woman.  It was a dangerous time for a woman to go without any security, and
yet some women did.  This might also possibly explain why later in the book of
Ezra that the men get into trouble because they married foreign wives.  They
were looking at the women of the land because there were probably not enough
women who had gone to Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.   </p>
