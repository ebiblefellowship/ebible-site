<p>Lately&mdash;actually, this has been going on for awhile, but
especially lately over the last couple of months&mdash;people have been writing and
asking the question, &ldquo;How can I know that I am saved?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because we have learned where we are in history.  We
are right up against the end of the world.  May 21 in 2011 will be the rapture
and then there will be that five months of torment.  Then on October 21, it will
be the end of this world and universe and all of unsaved man who are upon it.  God
will completely destroy all things.  </p>

<p>People are hearing these things.  With an honest reaction,
they are looking at themselves and at their lives, as God commands us to do. 
He tells us to examine ourselves to see if we are in the faith, so people are
looking and they are wondering, &ldquo;Am I really born again?  Am I a true child of
God?&rdquo;, because this is very important as we are approaching, day-by-day, ever
closer to the end of the world.  </p>

<p>Somebody was telling me a way of illustrating this the other
day.  I hope I get this right because it involved math and a few calculations. 
But he was looking at the time that we have left as if the whole history of the
world was one day.  He went through a calculation of the 13,021 years that the
world has been around since creation and he related that to a 24-hour day.  (I
do not know exactly how all of this works out.  I told him to send me an email
so that I could really look it over, but he just told me on the phone.)  He
calculated that if the whole 13,023 years were one day, since we have about two
years left, that would be around 13 seconds to midnight, according to his
calculation.  </p>

<p>I thought that was a good way of illustrating how little
time we do have left, how short the time is.  Two years are going to fly. 
Whether I will be here or you will be here, personally, we do not know because
any one of us could die today or any day.  But the Lord will continue the world
for two years, and then that day will come for the world as God has planned it. 
It is going to happen as He has outlined this in His Word.  </p>

<p>So this is a good image that we have on the &ldquo;May 21&rdquo; tract
of an hourglass.  You turn the hourglass over and the sand begins to sink into
the lower part of the hourglass.  If you look at the tract, there are just a
few grains of sand left in the top portion and it is still continuing to fall. 

</p>

<p>As this is getting closer, day-by-day, questions that maybe
people have had for a long time are coming up, &ldquo;Am I really saved?&rdquo;  The true
believer will be honest about this and will look at themselves, because God
tells us to do this.  We will look at ourselves in the light of the Word of
God.  </p>

<p>For instance, in 1 John 2, it says in the first verse, and I
will read the first few verses, 1 John 2:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but
also for <i>the sins of </i>the whole world.  </p>

<p>This means that Jesus is the only Saviour.  He paid for the
sins of only His people and He is the only way to have sins forgiven in the
world.  </p>

<p>Then verse 3, 1 John 2:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
commandments.  </p>

<p>This is what the Bible tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him&hellip;  </p>

<p>This means that we can understand that we are saved.  We can
have the knowledge that we are saved.  But even with the true believer who
recognizes that there has been a big change in their life, still, at times,
doubts can come: like with King David, after he had fallen into sin with
Bathsheba in having her husband, Uriah the Hittite, slain by the sword of the
enemy.  After being confronted by Nathan the prophet, where God revealed his
sin to him and that it was not hidden from God&mdash;nothing ever is, &ldquo;all things are
naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do&rdquo;&mdash;David was
convicted of his sin.  In Psalm 51, we find him crying out, &ldquo;Create in me a
clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.&rdquo;  And David was a
believer; he was a true child of God.  </p>

<p>So it is sin that normally brings doubt.  It is our sin. 
This is why some people struggle, because they are still seeing sin in their
life and they recognize, if we continue reading here in 1 John 2:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is
a liar, and the truth is not in him.  </p>

<p>We can definitely know that we are in trouble with God if we
are going on in sin and we are not being corrected by the Word of God.  If we
are continuing in sin, if we are continuing to do the same things, maybe, that
we have been doing for a long time, then God is saying, &ldquo;Alright, if you are
not obeying My Word, if you are not listening to My Word and understanding My
Word, then you can know that you are not a child of God since you have that
kind of reaction to the Word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There are some people who look at a couple of verses&mdash;like Psalm
51 with King David or maybe they look at Solomon, who was beloved of the Lord,
and his sin&mdash;and they try to get assurance of their own situation through those
cases, &ldquo;Well, I did not sin like that, like Solomon; I never committed adultery
in that way.&rdquo;  Or, &ldquo;Look at David; he committed adultery and had someone
killed.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But that is not what these cases are designed to do.  They
are not designed to give us assurance because of our own sin that we are a
child of God.  God does not operate in that way.  He is showing us that when
sin comes into someone&rsquo;s life, it brings doubt and fear and that they will
begin to lack assurance of salvation.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to 1 John 2:3, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
commandments.  </p>

<p>And if we go over to John 14:15, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">If ye love me, keep my commandments.  </p>

<p>This is restated in another place, &ldquo;If you love Me.&rdquo;  God
tells us in 1 John that we will love Him because He first loved us.  This is
the only way that this can work.  We cannot love God and desire to keep His
commandments without God first initiating this and taking the first step in
working out salvation in our lives.  </p>

<p>Here, Jesus is saying, &ldquo;This is one way that you can know if
you love Me, if you keep My commandments.&rdquo;  And the reverse is true.  If we do
not keep His commandments, then we do not love Him.  We might say that we do. 
People profess to love Christ repeatedly and in countless ways.  </p>

<p>If you ask a professing Christian in the world today, &ldquo;Do
you love God?  Do you love Jesus?,&rdquo; their answer is, &ldquo;Yes; yes, I love Him and
I praise Him,&rdquo; and they will speak very well of Christ.  However, they are not obeying
the Word of God.  </p>

<p>We know that God has commanded for individuals in the church
to come out of the church; therefore, in obedience to God&rsquo;s command, people
ought to leave the churches and congregations and come out.  There are many
other doctrines that God commands and many people do not obey the Word of God. 
They do not obey God Himself and that is evidence that someone is not a true
child of God.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Philippians 2 and take a look at verses 12 and
13, where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
do of <i>his </i>good pleasure.  </p>

<p>What does God tell us about salvation in the Bible when we
become saved, when a person becomes saved?  He tells us that He gives us a new
heart and a new spirit and that He will work in our lives to do His will, as it
says here: it is God who works in you.  </p>

<p>If we compare this with Ezekiel 36, which really says it
very straightforwardly, Ezekiel 36:25-27:   </p>

<p class="verse">Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A
new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart
of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do <i>them.</i></p>

<p>Here is the way that any child of God can obey God.  It is
because God has given us of His Spirit.  He has placed His Spirit in our
souls.  He has given us that new Spirit.  He also indwells us.  Then He causes
us to walk in the law, to walk in the Word of God.  This is why there should be
a big change in the life of anyone who thinks that they are saved.  There
should be a dramatic change from how they used to live to how they are living
now.  </p>

<p>This is the case, but sometimes it is easier to see with
people who have been out in the world.  Like many of the other people in the
world, they have been doing the things that everyone else has been doing in the
world: drinking or drugs or smoking or cursing or lying or cheating, the whole gamut. 
Everybody is involved in these things, to some degree.  Then when they come
under the hearing of the Word of God and God gives them a new heart and a new
spirit, there should be a dramatic change.  </p>

<p>In some cases, this might even be easier for them to
recognize because they are no longer drinking.  They are no longer going to the
bar or involved in other things that are contrary to the Word of God, but they
are now endeavoring to do things God&rsquo;s way.  As they go along, they do find
that they are obeying the Word of God more and more.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, you can have some people who grew up
maybe in a Christian home and from their early years, they were involved in
hearing the Gospel.  So it is not as dramatic, in that sense, for them because
it is a little harder for them to see.  They never got into a lot of that
stuff.  </p>

<p>However, there should also be a change in them because we
all sin.  We all have sins in thought, in word, and in deed; and so, they, too,
should begin to see differences in their lives, as God&rsquo;s Spirit is within them
and causing them to obey His Word and to keep His commandments.  </p>

<p>Let me ask everyone: can we know, as we look at ourselves,
can we know that we are truly born again, based on how we keep the law of God? 
That is dangerous, is it not?  That is dangerous, because God tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him, <span class="underline">if</span> we keep his
commandments.  </p>

<p>So we can examine ourselves and we can look ourselves to see
if we are in the faith; however, it only goes to a certain point.  I do not
think that we should look at our lives and say, &ldquo;Well, I am not doing this and
I am no longer doing that, so I must be a child of God,&rdquo; and then just convince
ourselves that we are believers.  </p>

<p>I do not think that a true believer should do this.  No.  As
we are examining ourselves, if we go to Psalm 139, the child of God is brought
to this point, as we do look at our lives.  It says in Psalm 139:23-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
thoughts: And see if <i>there be any </i>wicked way in me, and lead me in the
way everlasting.  </p>

<p>You see, this is what the Lord would have us to do, because
self-examination brings us to a certain point.  But when we are at the point
of, &ldquo;Okay, it is good that I have an interest in the Bible and in sharing the Gospel
and so forth,&rdquo; we must realize, &ldquo;yet I, as a man, have a desperately wicked
heart.&rdquo;  Naturally, when we are born into the world with that heart of stone
and sin, it is very deceitful.  It is desperately wicked and deceitful above
all things.  </p>

<p>This tells us that our heart is really not something to be
trusted.  We should not trust it because there are nearly two billion people in
the world today who say that they are Christians, yet the vast majority of them
are not.  They are not and they give all kinds of evidence indicating that they
are not true believers. </p>

<p>This is why the believer will come to a certain point and,
really, cannot go beyond, where we see that we are doing things differently and
in God&rsquo;s way and yet we do not trust ourselves.  We do not trust ourselves and
so we cry to God, &ldquo;Search me; try me; prove me to show me that I am a child of
God, and then lead me in the way of everlasting.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There is a good verse in Psalm 35 that really helps us out
in this whole area of assurance.  By the way, I forgot to mention this, but if
some people lack assurance, it could be because they are not saved.  They are
not saved at all and they may not know it because, at this point, they are not
yet saved.  Well, here in Psalm 35, it says in verse 1, Psalm 35:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Plead <i>my cause, </i>O JEHOVAH, with them that strive with me:
fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and
stand up for mine help. Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way </i>against
them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation. Let them
be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back
and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that in this context here, it is
discussing the spiritual battle, &ldquo;fight against them that fight against me&hellip;the
shield and buckler&hellip;stand up for my help&hellip;draw out the spear and stop the way
against them that persecute me&rdquo;?  It is a Psalm of beseeching the Lord that the
Lord would come and help us, that He would fight the battle and not we
ourselves.  And flowing along within this, we find in the last half of verse 3:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation.  </p>

<p>I wonder why God puts this in this kind of context?  I think
that the reason is because we are in a spiritual battle, and many people can
give examples of this kind of spiritual battle that the Christian is in.  But
the greatest of helps, the greatest of aids to someone who is a believer and
who understands the Bible and the teachings of the Bible and is sharing it with
other people is that, in response, there is reviling or there is reproach, or
even on occasion, people are oppressing, and the biggest aid is for God, not to
stop them from doing it&mdash;it is not to have them turn around or turn away from
us&mdash;but it is to know that we are saved.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation.  </p>

<p>Then, at that point, if we know that we are saved and that
we are a child of God, then it makes all of the rest so much easier, so much easier. 
The burden is a great deal lighter and it helps us in every area of our lives. 
</p>

<p>But notice that this Psalm is a cry to God:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;say unto my soul, I <i>am </i>thy salvation.  </p>

<p>How is God speaking today?  How is the Lord speaking today? 
If we pray this to God, &ldquo;O Lord, say unto my soul, I am thy salvation,&rdquo; which
is an excellent prayer, how could He speak to our soul?  He cannot speak to us
by breaking the barrier of the supernatural.  He will not do that anymore.  He
is not going to speak from heaven with a bolt of lightning.  That is not going
to happen.  </p>

<p>God speaks to us through His Word, through the Bible, as we
know that Romans 10:17 tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">So then faith <i>cometh </i>by hearing, and hearing by the word
of God.  </p>

<p>God is speaking to us every time we open up the Bible and we
read.  </p>

<p>What is a person to do, as we are getting shorter and
shorter on time?  What is someone to do?  Are they just to say, &ldquo;Well, I do not
know if I am saved, but I will just keep going on; I will just keep continuing
on.  I think that there is a chance that I might be saved; but then again, when
I look at other things, there is a chance that I might not be saved.  So I will
just keep continuing on&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Of course, there is nothing that we can do to bring
salvation to ourselves, and there are multitudes who give themselves
assurance.  But there is something we can do that God permits, as He tells us
to &ldquo;strive to enter in at the strait gate&rdquo;; that is, put forth effort towards
being under the hearing of the Word of God so that God can save us, which means
to read the Bible.  </p>

<p>Whenever we are reading in the Bible, no matter where we are
reading, that is the Word of God and God is speaking to us.  The Lord is
speaking directly to the reader of the Bible, so this would be an excellent
prayer every time someone read the Bible.  God just spoke.  When you are done,
close it.  You just read a certain portion of Scripture.  Close it and then
pray, &ldquo;O Lord, say unto my soul, I am thy salvation&rdquo;; that is, &ldquo;Be my Saviour
through the Word of God, and may Your Word testify to my soul,&rdquo; as we find in Romans
8:15-16.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The
Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>

<p>We can see, once again, what God is saying, which is that we
do not bear witness to ourselves.  That is one way of putting it.  We can look
at ourselves and we can examine ourselves to see if we are in the faith, and
then that self-examination finally brings us to a point where we cry out to
God, &ldquo;You search me, O Lord, to convince me.&rdquo;  Then we wait on God and His
Spirit to testify or bear witness to our spirit that we are a true believer.  </p>

<p>This is the part that so many people do not like, the part
of waiting on the Lord, of waiting on God.  There are multitudes of gospels and
doctrines that are out there in the world that teach, &ldquo;You can know right now
that you are a believer.  All you have to do is take these steps: come down the
aisle, accept Christ, be baptized, say the sinner&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo;  After doing this,
the pastor will assure you and the church will assure you that you are now a
member of the heavenly kingdom, that you are now a child of God.  And, &ldquo;It is
so easy.  Why complicate it?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, all of that is based on a misreading of several verses
in the Bible where they do not realize that we can never bring salvation to
ourselves.  The Bible tells us, &ldquo;With man, it is impossible&rdquo;&mdash;there is no way
that anybody can bring salvation to themselves&mdash;&ldquo;but with God, all things are
possible.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is His testimony to our spirit that we wait on, that He
will speak to our soul and convince us through His Word.  We keep reading the
Bible&mdash;faith comes by hearing&mdash;and then we pray, &ldquo;Lord, testify to my heart
through what I am reading.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the only safe way of waiting on the Lord, and there
is a test involv<span style='color:black'>ed if anyone does not know that they
are saved.  </span>The test is: will that individual grow so anxious and grow
so fearful of what is coming that they will cease to wait on God and try to
gain assurance some other way through some other method?  This is part of the
test.  </p>

<p>We are in a similar situation as the Israelites were when
they came out of Egypt.  They were led to the brink of the Red Sea and the
Egyptian host was hot on their tails.  They were frightful and fearful because
there seemed to be no way out, no deliverance possible, and yet God moved Moses
to say, &ldquo;Behold!  You will see the salvation of the Lord,&rdquo; and the sea parted. 
</p>

<p>I think that God is&mdash;well, I do not know if I will say &ldquo;pleased&rdquo;&mdash;but
I think that anyone who is waiting on the Lord for their salvation is much more
pleasing than individuals who have taken it to themselves and have convinced
themselves that they are believers, that they are children of God.  It is much
more difficult to wait for God to save us and to wait on the Lord for that
salvation.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Psalm 130:1-4, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O JEHOVAH. Lord, hear
my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If
thou, JEHOVAH, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But <i>there
is </i>forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.  </p>

<p>Why are those two thoughts put together?  We would think, &ldquo;There
is forgiveness with Thee, that Thou might be praised or glorified.&rdquo;  But, no. 
It says, &ldquo;There is forgiveness with Thee, that Thou mayest be feared.&rdquo;  Or in
the first part, we could say, &ldquo;There is awful wrath with Thee that You should
be feared,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;There is terrible anger over sin with You that You should be
feared,&rdquo; but it does not say that.  It says, &ldquo;There is forgiveness with Thee.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>There is a real possibility for any person in the world,
from our perspective&mdash;as we send the Gospel out, we do not know who the elect
are&mdash;for any one of them to be one of God&rsquo;s elect and for God to save them.  But
the whole ball of wax or everything involved with salvation is not in our
hands, it is in God&rsquo;s hands.  Forgiveness is with Him, and that is one of the
reasons why He is to be feared.  </p>

<p>Has anyone who is doubting experienced fear? Have you
experienced fear?  &ldquo;Well, I do not know.  I do not know if I am really a child
of God.  Sometimes I do, but then I seem to commit that sin again and I begin
to be troubled in mind and doubt.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Waiting on the Lord is the time when fear can enter into a
person&rsquo;s life.  We begin to fear God and think, &ldquo;Well, I might not be a child
of God.&rdquo;  But this is how God has laid it out where there must be waiting on <span
style='color:black'>Him, as it says in Psalm 130:5:  </span></p>

<p class="verse"><span style='color:black'>I wait for JEHOVAH, my</span> soul
doth wait, and in his word do I hope.  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a great statement?  &ldquo;I wait on the Lord; I am
determined to wait on the Lord because I know that there is nowhere else to
go.  There is no other religion that can save.  There is no other gospel. 
There are plenty of gospels, but there is no other real Gospel that can save. 
I am going to wait on the Lord and hope in His Word, because the Bible tells us
that He is merciful.  He is a merciful God.  He is compassionate.  He delights
in mercy.  He is kind.  He is gracious and full of grace.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>God is all these things, and then we look at the life of Christ
during His ministry when so many people were coming to Him to be healed of
blindness and deafness or palsy.  There were individuals who could not walk,
and on and on.  But in every case when people came to Him, He forgave them. 
There is not one case in the New Testament where someone came to Christ, at
least that I am aware of, and He turned them away.  </p>

<p>Nobody should take this to mean that if they go to God and
they pray, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy,&rdquo; that this is going to guarantee their
salvation, but it does show us that the Lord Jesus is most compassionate and
kind and gracious.  All of those healings were pictures of salvation, so it
does relate to salvation.  </p>

<p>If we go to Him and beseech Him, we should know the
character of God, that He is extremely merciful and that He might have mercy
upon us.  But we go like the Ninevites and we cry out, as we are desiring to
turn from our sins, &ldquo;Who can tell <span class="underline">if</span> the Lord will turn from the evil
that He intends?&rdquo;  We just hope in the Word of God, &ldquo;Oh, I hope that the Word
of God saves me!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that our hope as we are reading the Bible, because
this is how God saves?  &ldquo;I just hope that the Word of God saves me,&rdquo; like Job
who said, &ldquo;Though He slay me, I will trust in Him.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are going to continue moving towards this day.  Time is
going to pass quickly.  Some are going to come up close, if anyone is doubting,
and they could still be doubting if this were May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2011, which
will be here shortly.  You could have the same exact mind that you have right
now with the same troubles and maybe even the same sins.  </p>

<p>I do not know who is one of God&rsquo;s elect or who is not, but
God could have individuals who are truly His elect going right up against the
end of the world and the day of the rapture and, at that time, still struggling
with these things; but, yet, they are not running away.  They are not going to
a church, &ldquo;Oh, I am going somewhere where it is much more comfortable to be, as
far as people assuring me that I am a child of God, somewhere where I do not
have to hear this &lsquo;examining myself&rsquo; business at all and I do not have to worry
about it.&rdquo;  There are a thousand different places people can run to, but God
says, &ldquo;They that endure to the end shall be saved.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So here are individuals who are troubled, really troubled
and mourning over their sin.  They are going up to the last week, right up
towards the very last day of salvation, and yet they do not know, like Job
said, &ldquo;Though He slay me, I will trust in Him.  I will continue to seek the
Lord and cry out to Him for His mercy.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I think this idea is what we find in the book of Esther.  In
Esther 4, we find that Mordecai is encouraging Esther to go before the king. 
She tells him that there is only one law for anyone who goes into the king&rsquo;s
inner chamber without being called, which is death except he extend the golden
scepter out and then one can find grace.  At first, Esther is resistant to
doing this, but finally she is convinced and she tells Mordecai to gather the
Jews and to pray for her.  Then it says in Esther 4:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also
and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which <i>is
</i>not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.  </p>

<p>So this is the only hope.  Boldly, may we go to the throne
of grace.  As it tells us in Hebrews 4, &ldquo;Boldly, come to the throne of grace to
find grace to help in time of need.&rdquo;  This is what Esther is thinking, &ldquo;I am
going to go to the king who is seated upon his throne that I might have an
audience with him and find grace in his sight, and yet there is a very real
possibility that I could perish.  I may not live.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know that Esther did go in, and it says in the next
chapter, Esther 5:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
the court, <i>that </i>she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out
to Esther the golden sceptre that <i>was </i>in his hand. So Esther drew near,
and touched the top of the sceptre. Then said the king unto her, What wilt
thou, queen Esther? and what <i>is </i>thy request? it shall be even given thee
