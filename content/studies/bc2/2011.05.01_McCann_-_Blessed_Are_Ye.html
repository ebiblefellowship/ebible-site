title: Blessed Are Ye
---
<p>Let us go to Luke 6.  I will begin in verse 20.  We read in
Luke 6:20-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed <i>be
ye </i>poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed <i>are ye </i>that hunger
now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed <i>are ye </i>that weep now: for ye shall
laugh. Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate
you <i>from their company, </i>and shall reproach <i>you, </i>and cast out your
name as evil, for the Son of man&rsquo;s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for
joy: for, behold, your reward <i>is </i>great in heaven: for in the like manner
did their fathers unto the prophets. But woe unto you that are rich! for ye
have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall
hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you,
when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false
prophets.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This is the parallel passage to the Beatitudes that we find
in Matthew 5.  These are very familiar to us.  This is known as the Sermon on
the Mount.  We read in Matthew 5:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed <i>are
</i>the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  </p>

<p>God loves to teach.  We find this in many places in the
Bible, and yet it does not make sense to the world that believers are so
involved in their Bibles and that they are so wrapped up in them.  The world
does not understand this.  </p>

<p>I remember one guy I used to work with.  He was Catholic. 
When I would read my Bible at lunchtime, he would say to me, &ldquo;Do you not know
that there are other books in the world?  There are other books.&rdquo;  What he
meant was that he did not understand how I could just keep reading this same
Book.  </p>

<p>I understood what he meant.  Some people do read a fictional
book more than once, but most people do not read a fictional book again and
again and get an in-depth study from it.  It is the same with non-fiction
books, which can have a little bit of good information in them.  What value is
there in wrapping one&rsquo;s life up in a single book of psychology or a single book
of history or a single book of math?  </p>

<p>But for the true believers, they are completely wrapped up
in the Bible.  This is because the Bible is the Word of God and God teaches
them through the Bible.  For instance, let us go to Psalm 25 where we will see
several references to teaching.  We read in Psalm 25:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
enemies triumph over me. Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them
be ashamed which transgress without cause.  </p>

<p>One big tactic that the world uses is to try to get the
believer to try to feel shame.  They often declare, &ldquo;You should be ashamed of
yourself that you are going around fear mongering and telling everyone about
May 21<sup>st</sup>.  You should be ashamed of this.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Is it fear mongering if a hurricane is coming and the
weather service interrupts your regularly-scheduled programming to tell you
that a hurricane is coming and that it is going to hit right where you live? 
No one would say that this is fear mongering, right?  Instead, they would say, &ldquo;Thank
you.  We give thanks to the weather service for telling us this so that we can
make preparation.  We can gather some valuables.  We can collect our children
and escape and get out of here before it hits.&rdquo;  This is not fear mongering. 
Everyone knows that this is a good thing and that the people of the weather
service are doing a good work.  </p>

<p>This is how things are, too, when the child of God
absolutely knows that Judgment Day is coming on May 21<sup>st</sup> and they
are warning people.  The intent is not to fear monger.  </p>

<p>Some people even say that we are trying to scare people into
the churches.  No; we do not want anybody to go to the church, so why should
anyone think that we are trying to scare people into the churches?  Do we have
any kind of membership anywhere that we want people to sign up for?  What is the
purpose behind this fear mongering?  It is not to get people into the
churches.  It is not to develop some kind of list of names.  We do not even
know or care who is out there and receiving this message.  This is in God&rsquo;s
hands and under His control.  </p>

<p>Is it to make money?  This is something that the world
suspects because there have been Christian ministries who have done things like
this and deceived people in order to make money.  But how is Family Radio
making money by putting up billboards all over the world saying that Judgment
Day is May 21<sup>st</sup>?  They are spending all of their money.  They are
going for broke to get this message out.  If any money were to come in, they
would spend this, too.  They are not trying to gather money.  They are not
trying to get rich.  Anybody who knows anything about Family Radio would
realize this.  They would know that this is not the reason behind it.  </p>

<p>The reason is just to give a warning to people because God
has told us to do this.  In Ezekiel 33, God speaks of the watchman.  When he
sees &ldquo;the sword come upon the land,&rdquo; he is to &ldquo;blow the trumpet, and warn the
people.&rdquo;  Then He says in Ezekiel 33:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house
of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from
me.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s responsibility.  He is saying that He takes
full responsibility.  He wants His people to warn the world, but we should know
that this warning is actually coming from Him and that He is the One who is
behind all of this and the One doing all of this.  </p>

<p>This is why God&rsquo;s people are so busy right now occupying
with this Gospel message, and this is the Gospel.  Whatever God decides is the
Gospel, this is the Gospel; and saying, &ldquo;Judgment Day&rdquo; is a big part of the
message of God and the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Going back to Psalm 25:3, God is saying to the true believer
who waits on Him:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause.  </p>

<p>When you are standing outside a stadium on the Lord&rsquo;s Day
passing out tracts on Sunday the Sabbath, people look at you like you are the
strangest thing in the world.  But no; the child of God is doing what God
requires.  He is obeying God.  He is being faithful to God.  </p>

<p>The world does not understand this.  They think that Sunday
is just another day to relax, a day to have fun, a day to do whatever they
want.  They do not understand the whole idea of the Sabbath, the whole idea of
spiritual activity on that day; and yet God does and He is telling the believer
not to be concerned with what other people think.  </p>

<p>We are not to even care what other people think of us.  We
are definitely not to feel ashamed because of the message that we have to share
with them as we are standing there while these people are going contrary to His
Word and to what He would have them to do on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.  No; we are not to
be ashamed; let them be ashamed.  If anyone should be ashamed it is those who
are going about and doing things that are contrary to the Law of God, to the commandments
of God.  </p>

<p>We find this problem everywhere and we are not to judge
them, but we should also not allow their judgment to affect us to the point
where we want to just crawl under a rock because they do not like what we are
doing and because they do not like this message.  Mankind would try to have the
child of God feel shame about this, but God is telling us not to feel any shame
because God is the One who determines what is right and what is wrong, what is
proper and what is improper, what someone should be ashamed of and what someone
should not be ashamed of.  We should be ashamed of sin in any form; but if we
are doing something good, like sharing the Gospel out of a heart of love and
concern, do not feel ashamed.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Psalm 25:4-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Show me thy ways, O JEHOVAH; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy
truth, and teach me: for thou <i>art </i>the God of my salvation; on thee do I
wait all the day. Remember, O JEHOVAH, thy tender mercies and thy
lovingkindnesses; for they <i>have been </i>ever of old. Remember not the sins
of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for
thy goodness&rsquo; sake, O JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This reminds me of the thief on the cross who said, &ldquo;Lord,
remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&rdquo;  Psalm 25:7 is basically what
he is asking for:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
according to thy mercy remember thou me&hellip;  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s mercy; this is what he is pleading for, &ldquo;Lord,
remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom;&rdquo; and Christ said, &ldquo;Verily I say
unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.&rdquo;  This is because God is
remembering His mercy.  This is like a plea to God.  We can remind God not to
forget that He is extremely merciful, that His &ldquo;mercy <i>endureth </i>for ever,&rdquo;
that He &ldquo;delighteth <i>in </i>mercy,&rdquo; and that He has &ldquo;abundant mercy.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are sinners reminding God, as if we could, and this is
what He tells us to do, &ldquo;God, please do not forget that You are gracious and
kind and full of compassion.&rdquo;  This is what He tells us to do when we go to Him
in prayer.  He tells us to &ldquo;take with you words&rdquo; in order to bring these things
to remembrance, but this is really just in order to encourage ourselves as we
pray to Him of who He is.  He is not a greedy miser with His spiritual riches,
with His forgiveness and mercy in salvation.  He does not hoard this.  He
delights to bestow this.  He gives this to people and anyone whom He gives this
to does not deserve it.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 25:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Good and upright <i>is </i>JEHOVAH: therefore will he teach
sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he
teach his way.  </p>

<p>God teaches and we know how He teaches.  We read in 1
Corinthians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which things also we speak&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the teachings of the Bible.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the
Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  </p>

<p>The Holy Ghost is God.  We are to compare Scripture with
Scripture, &ldquo;here a little, <i>and </i>there a little,&rdquo; and &ldquo;precept upon
precept.&rdquo;  This is how we arrive at correct doctrine, because then the Holy
Spirit is teaching.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what is going on in our day.  We read in
Mark 13:11 of this period of the Great Tribulation:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when they shall lead <i>you, </i>and deliver you up, take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but
whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye
that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  </p>

<p>At this time, God says to &ldquo;warn them from me.&rdquo;  When His
people do this, when we are acting as ambassadors as we beseech others to be
reconciled to Him, we do this on behalf of Christ as we go in His name.  </p>

<p>God is making sure that we understand this.  Yes; we are
doing the talking and the sharing, and we are the ones who are pointing out the
verses, but this is really coming from God.  It is the Holy Ghost because we
have followed the right way, the proper methodology, which is Scripture with
Scripture as we harmonized conclusions.  </p>

<p>The church that is so judgmental as far as the teaching of
Family Radio and these doctrines, do they follow the methodology of the Bible? 
Do they understand that when we look at a verse, we need to get out the
concordance to look up the words?  As we do, we go to Matthew, we go to
Revelation, we go here, we go there, and that we do this in order to define the
words and to allow God to give His own definition.  </p>

<p>Do they understand that this is what we are to do?  No; they
see this as jumping out of context.  If we show them this verse in 1
Corinthians 2:13 and then turn to Isaiah to understand what God means where He
says that we are to go &ldquo;here a little, <i>and </i>there a little&rdquo; and look at &ldquo;precept
upon precept&rdquo; in order to match and harmonize with what the Bible is saying,
they do not get it.  </p>

<p>This is why they are blind and deaf and why they cannot see
or understand what is going on.  They really believe that the people of God are
heretics.  They really believe that we are way off when we bring a date because
the Bible clearly states that &ldquo;of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man,</i>&rdquo; and
yet the real problem is that they do not understand how to understand the
Bible.  They do not know how to listen to God.  It is not that they do not know
how to teach.  It is that they do not know how to sit in subjection to the One
who does do the teaching, to God Himself, to the Spirit of God.  </p>

<p>The churches think that they are the teachers.  Some
churches are more obvious about this, like the Pope.  The Pope&rsquo;s words are
considered to be supreme and he is the authority.  The Protestant churches do
the same thing but in a more discrete way.  In the Protestant churches, the
pastor or the theologian or the men of the past are the authority rather than
God; but God indicates that this is not the way it is.  He indicates that He is
the One who will teach and that we are not &ldquo;to teach, nor to usurp authority
over the man.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This commandment, which is about women not teaching, does
this still apply in our day since the church age is over?  Definitely, because
this principle still applies.  The principle is that all the people who profess
to be Christian are really saying that they are the Bride of Christ; they are
the woman; and the Bible tells us that a woman is not &ldquo;to teach, nor to usurp
authority over the man.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is because, during the church age, as a woman sat
silently in the congregation, this was a witness right back to the pastor that
this was exactly the same way that they were to come to the Bible.  They were
to do it quietly, without a word.  We should never say our ideas or our
thoughts and what comes out of our mind, nor should we ever quote men in order
to establish doctrine, &ldquo;Calvin said this about election.  Luther said this
about faith.&rdquo;  No; this is not what we are to do.  We go to the Bible and He is
the One who teaches, as long as we follow His methods.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Luke 6:20.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed <i>be
ye </i>poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>Does this mean that if anyone is poor, if they do not have
earthly possessions, that they are &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; and that &ldquo;yours is the kingdom of God,&rdquo;
that they are saved?  Is this what this means?  It does not mean this, does
it?  </p>

<p>I used to have a lot more interaction with homeless people
years ago.  The church I went to had dinners for homeless people and we spent a
lot of time with homeless people.  I observed that they can be just as proud
and stubborn as anyone else; in some cases, more so.  If they are an unsaved
individual, they still have a proud heart.  Everyone has a proud heart.  It
does not mean that they are saved or that they are going to Heaven just because
they do not have a home or because they do not have money or because they do
not have things.  God is not saying this.  </p>

<p>Again, how do we know this?  How would we know this if we
stayed in the context of Luke 6?  How could we come to this conclusion?  The
only way we could know what God is talking about is to go over to Matthew 5:3. 
We read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>are </i>the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.  </p>

<p>This is a small example of how God wrote the whole Bible. 
He leaves things dangling and hanging so that people can quickly get the wrong
idea.  They can easily think that &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; are the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; ones.  Then when
we search it out, we find in Matthew that He is defining them to be &ldquo;the poor
in spirit.&rdquo;  They are the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; ones because they would be someone whom God
has broken and humbled.  It does not matter how much money they have or what
kind of house they live in or their possessions.  God saves someone and then
they become &ldquo;poor in spirit.&rdquo;  These are the ones who will enter into Heaven.  </p>

<p>So this is what we have to do.  If we had not found the
answer in Matthew, we might have needed to even find the answer back in the Old
Testament.  But God kindly made this comparison of one passage to another
passage easy, right?  </p>

<p>It is not always this easy.  &ldquo;Of that day and hour knoweth
no <i>man</i>&rdquo;; this is certainly not easy, but it is the same principle.  He
does not complete His thought.  He does not fill it out and He allows people to
take this verse and to use it in a wrong way.  Therefore, they conclude that
Judgment Day will not be May 21<sup>st</sup>.  They then believe that they do
not have to do anything about this.  </p>

<p>This is really what this is all about.  People do not want
to have to do anything about this.  They do not want to stop their sin.  They
do not want to stop going the way that they are going.  If they can convince
themselves that there is nothing to worry about, then they can just continue to
live as they normally do.  </p>

<p>This is also why people are so upset.  They realize that if
this were true from their perspective, then they really should be doing
something, right?  They would realize that they really should not be involved
in the things that they have been involved in and that they should go to God
more and read the Bible more and pray more.  </p>

<p>Just ask some people here, maybe even some of the children, &ldquo;Have
you done anything in response to this information?  Have you done anything? 
During all of this time that you have been hearing this and hearing this and
hearing this, has this impacted your life in any way?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If anyone has been constantly shooting this down in their
minds, they have probably not changed one bit.  They have probably not done
anything in response to this information, and yet this information requires
action like the Ninevites took action.  This requires someone to go to God and
to go to Him in an earnest and very serious way.  </p>

<p>Going back to Luke 6:21, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>are ye </i>that hunger now: for ye shall be filled&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, this is an incomplete thought.  Are the starving
people in the world blessed because they are hungry?  No; they are no more
blessed than those who have a good meal.  But we turn again to Matthew 5:6
where God makes this easy for us.  We read in Matthew 5:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>are </i>they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness: for they shall be filled.  </p>

<p>We find here a little more of an explanation.  This is not
because of different writing styles.  This is not because Luke missed this part
of it.  This is because God wrote this in this way.  This is exactly the way
that He wanted it to be written.  </p>

<p>This is what He has done throughout the whole Bible.  He
gives a verse and it is like a little snare that is laid for someone.  One
verse says that He is &ldquo;not willing that any should perish.&rdquo;  People find this
verse and conclude that God is not willing that anyone should be destroyed,
that He is not willing that anyone should perish, but they need to read the
rest of the Bible.  He is referring to His elect.  These are the ones whom He
is not willing for them to perish; but, of course, many will perish.  </p>

<p>There are just a great number of examples like this in the
Bible where a statement is made.  If someone quickly jumps on it and grabs it,
they will come to a wrong conclusion about 100% of the time.  This is just the
nature of how God wrote the Bible.  </p>

<p>This is like what people have done with this information
about Judgment Day.  What have they done with this?  Since this is so close, it
is constantly on my mind.  How can we stop thinking that Judgment Day is less
than three weeks away?  What have people done with this information?  </p>

<p>If someone is in the church, they might take their pastor&rsquo;s
word and not check anything out.  But maybe they have gone to the Bible and
casually skimmed its surface and read a verse like the verse that says that no
man knows.  For them, that was all they needed; that is it.  </p>

<p>How can they come to right knowledge this way when God tells
us that His Word is like &ldquo;hid <i>treasure</i>&rdquo; that we have to dig into and
search after, like buried gold or silver?  This is how we come to the Bible. 
We come with a ready mind to study to see &ldquo;whether those things were so&rdquo; when
we hear of them.  </p>

<p>It goes on in Luke 6:21 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed <i>are ye </i>that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  </p>

<p>By the way, let us get a quick definition from the Bible of
what it means to be &ldquo;blessed.&rdquo;  If we go to Psalm 133:3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">As the dew of Hermon, <i>and as the dew </i>that descended upon
the mountains of Zion: for there JEHOVAH commanded the blessing, <i>even </i>life
for evermore.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed <i>are </i>the poor in spirit.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Blessed <i>are </i>they
which do hunger and thirst after righteousness.&rdquo;  Then we read again in Luke
6:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed <i>are ye </i>that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  </p>

<p>That is, you are going to receive eternal life because you
are one of God&rsquo;s elect.  Yet now for a period, there is weeping.  There could
be mourning or sorrow.  </p>

<p>I have a couple of verses to look at that have to do with
weeping.  If we go to John 16, it says in John 16:20-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament&hellip;  </p>

<p>And Christ is speaking to the disciples.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your
sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she
remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. And
ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall
rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.  </p>

<p>This is the normal condition of the believers throughout
history.  &ldquo;In the world ye shall have tribulation.&rdquo;  Tribulation can make
someone feel a little sorrowful.  It is no fun to be made a reproach or to be
reviled or to be looked down on.  This is no fun, but Christ is giving us the
big picture; and I think that we can all see the big picture now, right?  Maybe
we had trouble with seeing this big picture for awhile in our lives, but we
have three weeks left and then eternity.  This is the big picture: eternal
life!  This is the blessing that has always been in view: &ldquo;<i>even </i>life for
evermore.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So here we are under three weeks left.  We have a task at
hand.  We have a job to do.  When we carry this out, there is definitely going
to be affliction in some way.  With some, there will be more affliction than
with others; but everyone may experience this to some degree.  Anyone will
experience this who is going out into the world with this message of Judgment
Day.  </p>

<p>So God is basically saying that for a short period of time,
we may weep; but, however, as we read in Luke 6:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed <i>are ye </i>that weep now: for ye shall laugh.    </p>

<p>God tells us that there is a certain time or a certain
season for everything.  In Ecclesiastes 3:1-4, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">To every <i>thing there is </i>a season, and a time to every
purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to
plant, and a time to pluck up <i>that which is </i>planted; A time to kill, and
a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep,
and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;  </p>

<p>This is why Christians do not get involved with dancing in
this life.  This is not the proper time.  We also do not get involved in going
out and having all of the fun that we can by enjoying ourselves and living it
up.  We do not live to &ldquo;eat, drink, <i>and </i>be merry.&rdquo;  This is not the
time.  This is not the time to just laugh and laugh and laugh.  </p>

<p>People really like to laugh.  Everyone likes to laugh.  Just
look at how much the world wants to laugh.  They pay people millions of dollars
to put on a television show just to try to get people to laugh or for a movie
in order to get people to laugh.  This is probably because the best thing that
someone could think of would be to have a nice laugh.  </p>

<p>But God is indicating that there is a time for everything
and that it is not yet for the child of God to laugh.  Do we laugh now?  Yes;
but this is speaking to a state of mind, what people have in their heart, what
their desires are, what they are seeking after.  Fun, pleasure, and laughter
all go together, but this is not what the true believer is seeking after.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 126.  It says in Psalm 126:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">When JEHOVAH turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter&hellip;  </p>

<p>The captivity of Zion was when the Jews of Judah were in Babylon. 
After seventy years, their captivity was turned.  They were released.  We read
again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then was our mouth filled with laughter&hellip;  </p>

<p>This was because that seventy-year period, which concluded
with the release of the Jews who had been in captivity from 609 B.C. to 539
B.C., typified the Great Tribulation.  Then King Cyrus freed the Jews.  They
were told to &ldquo;go up to Jerusalem,&rdquo; which was a picture of the rapture.  This is
when we laugh.  When David brought the Ark into Jerusalem, it was then that he
danced.  That was the time to dance; not now.  </p>

<p>We continue on to read in Psalm 126:2-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing: then said they among the heathen, JEHOVAH hath done great things for
them. JEHOVAH hath done great things for us; <i>whereof </i>we are glad. Turn
again our captivity, O JEHOVAH, as the streams in the south. They that sow in
tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious
seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <i>with
him.</i>  </p>

<p>At this time, it is a sorrowful thing to share the Gospel
with everyone.  This is a sorrowful thing.  </p>

<p>Maybe the children have felt left out or maybe they think
that their parents&rsquo; focus has not been on them like it was for a period of
time.  Maybe they used to give you more things, but now all that they are
thinking about is May 21<sup>st</sup>.  Do not think that your parents do not
love you.  They love you a great deal and they are praying for you.  They are
continuing to try to bring your attention back to this because what your
attention is on is of very little significance.  </p>

<p>If your attention is on summer vacation, this is not going
to happen.  If your attention is on college, if your attention is on a career
or on a family, if your attention is on these things, they are not going to
happen; and your parents are praying and hoping that your attention will be
brought to where it should be, which is that you have from now until May 21<sup>st</sup>
and that is it.  </p>

<p>Do you think that your parents are not praying to God and
weeping?  They are crying to God, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on my children because
they do not get this.  They do not see this.  They still want to play games. 
They are still involved in the things of this world as if they must believe
that these things are going to continue on.  They just do not believe what You
are telling us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is a time of increased sorrow.  God makes a point
that I think we will all be able to understand in Ecclesiastes 1.  We read in
Ecclesiastes 1:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For in much wisdom <i>is </i>much grief&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us that &ldquo;the wise shall understand,&rdquo; that &ldquo;a
wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment,&rdquo; that &ldquo;knowledge shall be
increased.&rdquo;  This is what God said to Daniel, &ldquo;Shut up the words, and seal the
book,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;knowledge shall be increased.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">For in much wisdom <i>is </i>much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow.  </p>

<p>We know that some of our family members, neighbors, and
friends, and that even people on the street are not getting this.  They are not
seeing this or understanding this or believing this.  Therefore, at this point,
they are giving every indication that they are going to die and that they are
going to perish and that they are going to be left behind to endure however
long they can make it through the five-month period.  </p>

<p>So this knowledge is a burden and it is heavy.  This, of
course, leads the child of God to go to God more in prayer.  Do you remember
the song, &ldquo;Sweet Hour of Prayer&rdquo;?  We need to up this a little.  We need more
than an hour for prayer.  There is so much to pray for and we have such a
burden for our family and friends and everyone else that an hour just is not
enough.  This is our release.  This is the child of God&rsquo;s comfort with this
heavy information that Judgment Day is less than three weeks away.  We go to
the Lord and we pour everything out to Him, and then He will sustain us and
help us.  </p>

<p>Going back to Luke 6:21, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed <i>are ye </i>that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  </p>

<p>Just look at Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16 and you see
the world.  There we see the rich man who &ldquo;fared sumptuously every day,&rdquo; and
there was the beggar Lazarus who waited &ldquo;to be fed with the crumbs which fell
from the rich man&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;  Then death comes to both, just like death would
come to all.  If the world would continue, we would all die.  This life is
guaranteed to end in death, except for the last generation, which we happen to
be.  </p>

<p>By the way, we have nineteen or twenty days left of
salvation where the door is open.  If we had nineteen or twenty years left,
this would not change anything.  The unsaved individual would still be unsaved
in nineteen or twenty years if they were not one of God&rsquo;s elect.  The child of
God would still be one of God&rsquo;s elect and he would understand it then as well
as now.  </p>

<p>Time is not really the issue.  This is not really the
problem.  If you had twenty years, you would do exactly for twenty years what
you have been doing with the time of your past life leading right up to this
point, unless God interceded and changed you.  </p>

<p>Do not think that things would be different if you only had
another year.  Things would not change one bit.  What God has simply done is
that He has speeded up the whole process.  Wherever an individual would be at
the point of their death, they are there now at this point.  </p>

<p>So we continue to share the Gospel with people, knowing that
God will save His elect and leave the rest, which is what He has been doing
throughout history.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 6:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed are ye&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, you are a child of God who has eternal life.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you <i>from their company, </i>and shall reproach <i>you, </i>and cast
out your name as evil, for the Son of man&rsquo;s sake.  </p>

<p>So blessed are ye when men hate you.  Do people hate the believer? 
Do they hate the true Christian?  </p>

<p>We read in 1 John 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  </p>

<p>This is really the world&rsquo;s condition.  They hate the light,
they hate the true Gospel of the Bible, and they also hate the one who brings
this message; and so God here is indicating that this is a blessing if this is
going on in your life.  </p>

<p>Let us go to a few more verses.  Turn to Matthew 24.  Of
course, this is the chapter where Jesus is answering the disciples&rsquo; question, &ldquo;What
<i>shall be </i>the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&rdquo;  We read
in Matthew 24:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name&rsquo;s sake.  </p>

<p>We also read in Mark 13:13, which is a parallel passage:  </p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall be hated of all <i>men </i>for my name&rsquo;s sake: but
he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  </p>

<p>Remember that one verse that we have noticed before in
Matthew 24:13 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 
</p>

<p>What are we to endure?  We are to &ldquo;endure sound doctrine,&rdquo;
but we are also to endure the world&rsquo;s opinion of us because we are aligning
ourselves with information that comes from the Bible, that comes from Christ;
and the world hated Christ.  </p>

<p>The believer is now aligning himself with information that
is going to reach everyone in the world and this is not a pleasant message.  It
has to do with judgment.  This convicts people because if you do not have sin
then why would you be judged?  This means that this message implies that man is
a sinner when they see this warning of Judgment Day.  This also, of course,
implies that God is merciful or why else would He bother to warn people except
for the possibility that He might grant forgiveness?  </p>

<p>So here God is indicating in these passages that all men
shall hate you.  Then in Mark 13:13, He ties all of this together in relation
to enduring:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but he that shall endure unto the end&hellip;  </p>

<p>When the Word of God becomes a reproach and when the world
casts shame upon the message, and so forth, anyone who in their heart is still
of the world will not be able to stand this.  They will not like this at all
because, inwardly, they are just like the world.  Because of this, they value
and greatly respect the world&rsquo;s opinion of them.  They really care what the
nations think of them, what their neighbors think, what their family thinks, and
what their friends on the corner think.  They are very concerned with the
impression that others have of them.  </p>

<p>If they themselves were to wear a shirt or a hat, or heaven
forbid, if their parents were to put a sign in their yard for the neighbors to
see or if their parents go even further than this and walk around with
backpacks with big signs, what terrible shame they feel that this is happening
and that their friends can see it.  But we must remember what Jesus said, &ldquo;For
whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man
be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We have to realize that we are not here to please man.  We
are not here to please people, but this is the nature of man.  We read in 1
Peter 4:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh
hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of <i>his </i>time
in the flesh <span class="underline">to</span> the lusts of men, but <span class="underline">to</span> the will of God.  </p>

<p>So the world has its ideas of how people should live and
conduct themselves, and God has His ideas.  The world is very accepting and
very approving of anything under the sun.  The world allows you to be whatever
you want.  If you want to dye your hair purple, feel free.  If you want to put
earrings everywhere possible on your body, feel free.  If you want to wear a
Mohawk hairstyle, feel free.  If you want to wear hardly any clothing, feel
free.  </p>

<p>You can do whatever you want to do and the world will accept
you, but there is one thing that is not acceptable.  Is this not interesting
that this is this one thing?  Should this not make people wonder and ask the
question, &ldquo;Why?  Why is it that people can do whatever they want except for
this one thing?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Would it be crazy if our T-shirts were representing a rock
band?  Would it be crazy if they were representing the Yankees or the Phillies? 
Am I considered crazy if I am wearing a Yankees hat and if I have Yankees this
and Yankees that?  Is it crazy if I put a Yankee pendant on my vehicle?  </p>

<p>Why is all of this acceptable?  And why is it that as soon
as you start aligning yourself with the Word of God, with the Bible, then you
are considered to be a crackpot and insane?  They call us morons and idiots and
fools, and I am just relaying what people said about me yesterday.  </p>

<p>When I was young, I really, really cared what people thought
about me to the extreme; and I do mean to the extreme.  This was how I was
raised, but I thank God that He has been able to change this.  My wardrobe has
come down to, &ldquo;What should I wear today?  Should I wear the grey Judgment Day
shirt or the yellow Judgment Day shirt or the florescent green Judgment Day
shirt?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When you wear a hat like this out and you wear the shirt,
when these things actually become part of your attire, this is very freeing
because these things have always been the case.  It has always been the case
that the world has hated the true believer, the child of God.  It is just that
it came out in little ways.  Maybe they would separate from you at work because
you did not participate with the cursing and because you did not agree with the
backstabbing and all of the gossiping.  </p>

<p>People in groups tend to vilify others.  This is how they
make allies with each other.  People become friends because they each pick on
the same person.  When you do not do this, they separate you from their
company; and this has always been the case, but this is now out in the open. 
We have made this very, very public, and this is very freeing.  This is freeing
because they now know exactly where we are coming from and we know where they
are coming from.  </p>

<p>We read next in 1 Peter 4:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the time past of <i>our </i>life may suffice us to have
wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts,
excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: Wherein
they think it strange that ye run not with <i>them </i>to the same excess of
riot, speaking evil of <i>you:</i>  </p>

<p>This is how they revile and reproach.  They consider you an
oddball and think it strange that you do not participate in these things.  </p>

<p>The question is: do you care or do I care what they think? 
It really comes down to this.  Do we care what they think or do you or I care
what God thinks?  Who is more important anyway and who has more power and
authority?  </p>

<p>God is the One whom we really want to be friends with, the One
whom we want to be in a good relationship with, even if all the world hates us,
even if we do not know another child of God anywhere.  The Bible says, &ldquo;If God <i>be
</i>for us, who <i>can be </i>against us?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So they think it strange, but here is what God says concerning
the opinion of the world.  In 1 Corinthians 4, God is moving Paul to write
these words, and we read in 1 Corinthians 4:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
you, or of man&rsquo;s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.  </p>

<p>Compare man&rsquo;s judgment to God&rsquo;s judgment.  We have today and
tomorrow and we are under three weeks.  Man can do a lot of damage and he can
say a lot of bad things and maybe even physically harm someone.  </p>

<p>This is all that man can do, but God&rsquo;s judgment begins on
May 21<sup>st</sup> and then there is nothing but torment.  Many will be left
behind in this broken world for however long they can make it.  Then at the end
of this, this world will be burned up and they will be annihilated and
completely gone forever.  They will not even be a distant memory.  They will be
no memory, because this world and the former things will not be brought to
mind.  They will be gone forever.  </p>

<p>This is the judgment of God, and so we can see who has more
power and who we really should be concerned about pleasing.  It should not be
man&rsquo;s opinion.  So what if they think that we are crazy!  If the world were to
demonstrate some sanity first, we might listen to them.  If they demonstrated
any kind of rationality, any kind of soundness of mind as we look at the world,
then maybe they could pass a judgment that would have some kind of an effect
upon the believer; but look at the wars, look at the crime, look at the abuse,
on and on in this world.  The world is in no position to cast judgment about sanity
on any believer.  This is for sure.  </p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes 9:3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">This <i>is </i>an evil among all <i>things </i>that are done
under the sun, that <i>there is </i>one event unto all: yea, also the heart of
the sons of men is full of evil, and madness <i>is </i>in their heart while
they live, and after that <i>they go </i>to the dead.  </p>

<p>In other words, the patients of the insane asylum, as we
look at this world, are the ones who are pronouncing a judgment or a diagnosis
of the child of God.  In the Bible, the child of God is typified by a man who
had many unclean spirits named Legion.  He was running around naked and cutting
himself, and then Christ saved him.  He cast out the devils.  Then they found
that this man who &ldquo;had the legion&rdquo; was &ldquo;sitting, and clothed, and in his right
mind&rdquo; as he sat by Jesus.  </p>

<p>This sound mind that God gives to His people should tell us
something about the world in itself, because the world thinks that the child of
God who has this sound mind is crazy.  This really goes a long way in
understanding the mindset of the world. </p>

<p>God perfectly knows the hearts of mankind and He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;madness <i>is </i>in their heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>Of course it is.  It has to be madness for people to hear
this and to hear it and hear it, to hear something that is coming from the
Bible, to hear something that is coming from God, and to take no action.  This
is insanity.  This is craziness.  </p>

<p>Please, do not worry about us killing ourselves.  People
like to say this, &ldquo;When this does not happen on May 22<sup>nd</sup>, you are
not going to kill yourself are you?  Do not drink the Kool-Aid.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, this is a way of taking a shot at the believer,
because, again, they cannot gainsay or resist Scripture, and so they have to
make statements like this to try to identify the believers with crazy cults
that have committed suicide.  </p>

<p>Well, let us ask this person who would say this to the child
of God a question.  When day passes day over the next few days and then we are
there and this happens, what did you do to yourself?  What did you do to
yourself by doing nothing, when God warned you repeatedly again and again and
again?  </p>

<p>You continued to disregard and to dismiss this and to claim,
&ldquo;Oh, those people are crackpots,&rdquo; or in whatever way you dismissed this, but
then this comes and this happens and you are left behind.  This will happen
just like God said that it would, because He declares &ldquo;the end from the
beginning.&rdquo;  It is not hard for Him to declare this.  But it is then that you
will want to cry out to God.  It is then that you will want a drop of the
Gospel mercy.  Well, really, the fact is that you killed yourself.  You killed
yourself in an eternal way.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
