<p>We went to Matthew 15 a little bit last week, which really
made me very interested in what is being said here.  In Matthew 15:21-28, we have
the account of a Canaanitish woman who comes to the Lord Jesus.  It says:</p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
  Sidon. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried
unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou </i>son of David; my
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. But he answered her not a word. And
his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth
after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children&rsquo;s bread, and cast
<i>it </i>to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
which fall from their masters&rsquo; table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O
woman, great <i>is </i>thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her
daughter was made whole from that very hour.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This passage is very encouraging I think to all of us, because
I am sure that God, in His mercy, has saved some people that came to Him the
first time, as they came to God and said, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy on me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We actually have an example of this with the thief on the
cross.  It did not take very long for God to save him, and it was absolutely
necessary that it not take long because he was going to die in a short while. 
But still, he said to Jesus, &ldquo;<b>Remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom</b>,&rdquo;
and Christ responded, &ldquo;<b>To day shalt thou be with me in paradise</b>.&rdquo;  He
saved him.  </p>

<p>There are other instances, like the man who was paralyzed.  First
Jesus said, &ldquo;<b>Son, thy sins be forgiven thee</b>.&rdquo;  Then when the Pharisees
said, &ldquo;<b>Who can forgive sins but God only</b>?,&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;<b>Whether is
it easier to say&hellip;<i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise&hellip;and walk</b>?&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>Actually, it is much easier for Christ to say, &ldquo;<b>Arise&hellip;and
walk</b>&rdquo; because He is a mighty God.  He is all powerful and He did say this
to him and the man did rise very easily from God&rsquo;s perspective, because this is
within His might, within His ability to do.  But in order for Jesus to say, &ldquo;<b><i>Thy
</i>sins be forgiven</b>,&rdquo; well, this is way more difficult because He had to
take that person&rsquo;s sins upon Himself and pay the penalty for those sins, which
He did &ldquo;<b>from the foundation of the world.</b>&rdquo;  He suffered and died in
order to tell him, &ldquo;<b><i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God, of course, does teach us that all the physical healings
in the Bible are really pointing to spiritual healings that come in salvation
when sinners are saved from their sins.  It is true that some people, like John
the Baptist, could have been saved before they even knew it and grew up as
children of God.  I hope that this is the case with some of the children here. 
Maybe since they have been under the hearing of the Gospel from the womb, from
the time they were being formed in their mother&rsquo;s belly, maybe God has saved
one of these children and it is just not evident yet as they are so young.  </p>

<p>God does do this, but I think a lot of people are probably
more like me who have gone to God and cried out for mercy and it just did not
happen like that.  It did not happen like that at all.  Maybe they have gone
again and again and again, repeatedly, over a period of time, maybe even years,
until the Lord did have mercy.  </p>

<p>There are many people who are still not sure if they are
saved, who have gone to God crying for mercy.  Maybe it has been a long period
of time and they still might be thinking that Christ is responding to them like
He initially responded to this woman, &ldquo;<b>He answered her not a word</b>.&rdquo;  He
did not say anything to this woman.  </p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why I wanted to come here.  One
of the first things I want to mention, because I do not want to forget this, is
that this woman in verse 22, this woman was not coming for herself.  She was
not coming because she had a disease or because she was a leper or because she
was &ldquo;<b>grievously vexed with a devil</b>.&rdquo;  She was coming on behalf of another
person, her daughter.  It says in verse 22, Matthew 15:22: </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord&hellip;  </p>

<p>This reveals something about parents.  This really reveals
something about mothers and fathers, not all mothers and fathers in the world
today, but mothers and fathers whom God has saved, that have a knowledge of the
truth of the true Gospel of the Bible and know that their children, even though
they might be happy and healthy and perfectly whole, may not be saved. </p>

<p>Is this not what the world looks at?  If they walk fine and
they talk fine and they see fine, they must be fine.  However, this is not the
truth, is it?  The truth is that from God&rsquo;s vantage point, from His perspective
as He looks on man, He sees the hearts of people and He does not see that all
is well with the child.  Whether they are a young toddler or an eight-year old
or a teenager, all is not well just because everything looks fine on the
outside.  </p>

<p>They are like a beautiful young flower that is in the prime
of life and continuing to develop, which is what the world praises.  The world
will praise beauty.  The world will greatly honour individuals who have youth
and are in the prime of life.  They are like this beautiful flower and
everything seems fine and okay, &ldquo;<b>but </b><b>the LORD looketh on the heart</b>.&rdquo; 
When &ldquo;<b>the LORD looketh on the heart[<i>s</i>]</b>&rdquo;<b> </b>of people, and
this is every unsaved person no matter what their age, He sees all manner of
wickedness, filthiness, and desperately sinful ugliness, we could say.  He does
not see anything beautiful, just like He said of the Pharisees, &ldquo;<b>for ye are
like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead <i>men&rsquo;s </i>bones</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>That is what God sees in people and believing parents
understand this, that we are all sinners.  We all come into the world in our
sin and we need a &ldquo;<b>Saviour</b>,&rdquo; and this is very much like being &ldquo;<b>grievously
vexed with a devil</b>&rdquo; when a person is not saved, because they are under the
power and the rule of Satan in their life.  They are not under God&rsquo;s power.  They
are not under the rule of the Lord Jesus.  Instead, they are in the kingdom of
darkness. </p>

<p> So this woman is coming because her daughter is troubled by
an &ldquo;<b>evil spirit</b>.&rdquo;  She is &ldquo;<b>grievously vexed with a devil</b>,&rdquo; just
like the man in Mark 9:21-22.  This man was crying out that his son might be
healed, and Jesus says:</p>

<p class="verse">And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
him? And he said, Of a child. And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and
into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
compassion on us, and help us.  </p>

<p>That is the father&rsquo;s plea.  He is pleading not just for the
child.  He said, &ldquo;us&rdquo;; he is crying out for both of them.  He has been greatly
afflicted himself through his child, because the child would throw himself &ldquo;<b>into
the fire, and into the waters</b>.&rdquo;  He was possessed.  As a result, the father
was very pained because this was his child and he loved his boy.  </p>

<p>This is what we see about parents that have come to Jesus on
behalf of their children. There is a love there that God has placed within the
mother or within the father so that they come very earnestly to Christ, &ldquo;<b>beseeching
him</b>&rdquo; that He would save their young one because they can see that the young
one is in trouble, that the young one is &ldquo;<b>g</b><b>rievously vexed</b>.&rdquo;<b>  

</b></p>

<p>At<b> </b>that<b> </b>time,<b> </b>of course,<b> </b>if you
had a child throwing himself &ldquo;<b>into the fire, and into the waters</b>,&rdquo; this would
be a very outward behavior that you could see.  But the truth is, any child
today or anyone who is not saved is seriously and<b> &ldquo;grievously vexed with a
devil</b>&rdquo; and in tremendous danger.  This is because the time for salvation is
getting very short.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people, who are parents, are aware of this.  We
realize this and understand that if the current situation that is going on
today with our children continues tomorrow and the next day and next year and all
the way into May of 2011, our children, if they continue on as we look at them
and see little interest in the Bible, little interest in the Gospel, these same
children whom we love are going to die.  They are going to die horribly.  They are
going to die at some point.  Either on May 21 or at some point during the five-month
period, they are going to perish and be destroyed.  </p>

<p>We do not want this.  We are afraid of this, and so we go to
the Lord &ldquo;<b>beseeching him</b>,&rdquo; just like this woman.  This is actually a
prayer because she is going to Christ and asking Him to heal her daughter.  </p>

<p>If we go over to Mark 7, we have the parallel account in
Mark 7:24-26, and it says:</p>

<p class="verse">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
and entered into an house, and would have no man know <i>it: </i>but he could
not be hid. For a <i>certain </i>woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: The woman was a Greek, a
Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the
devil out of her daughter.  </p>

<p>Here, we get a little bit more information about this
woman.  She &ldquo;<b>fell at his feet</b>.&rdquo;  She is on her knees.  She is on her
knees before Christ and crying out, as it says here in Matthew 15:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou </i>son of David&hellip;  </p>

<p>She is coming exactly as God would have someone come to Him,
humbly.  She is coming, not saying, &ldquo;You must save my daughter.  Lord, You have
to save my daughter.&rdquo;  She is coming petitioning, very humbly, recognizing that
Jesus is God, recognizing that Jesus is &ldquo;<b>the Messiah</b>,&rdquo; the promised &ldquo;<b>son
of David</b>,&rdquo; and she is just laying it all out, &ldquo;<b>Have mercy on me</b>.&rdquo;  Why? 
Because her daughter was in serious trouble.  She is on her knees, which is why
it is so striking, &ldquo;<b>He answered her not a word</b>.&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>Not a word</b>&rdquo;; Jesus
did not respond to this woman.  </p>

<p>Have any of you gone to God in the secret chamber, which is
different for everyone?  But have you gone in your home somewhere when you got
alone and got down on your knees and prayed to the Lord for mercy, either for
yourself, for your children, for your family, for your friends, for your
neighbours?  What happens?  </p>

<p>Well, we do not know what is going on with God as far as our
prayers.  We know that He hears us in the sense that He knows all things.  As
believers, we are also knowledgeable that we have to go to God and say, &ldquo;May
your will be done.&rdquo;  We cannot insist or force God to save anyone, but we can
plead with Him that He might save someone.  We can go to Him and as we do, it
could be that nothing, seemingly nothing happens, and so we get up.  At this
point, some people get discouraged and become disappointed because they feel
like they poured out their heart and they feel like they did come to God
humbly, and yet, &ldquo;<b>no word</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is why this passage is so encouraging to all of us who
are praying for others, and we will go on with this in a little bit but I want
to also mention a couple of other things.  One other thing is that this is a
prayer addressed to Jesus while He was on earth.  He came out of the &ldquo;<b>coast
of </b><b>Tyre</b><b> and </b><b>Sidon</b>.&rdquo;  He was in the world.  In other
words, He was at a particular place.  </p>

<p>Have you ever thought that if Jesus was in downtown Philadelphia
today or in a nearby city like New York or Baltimore, you would go to Him?  Have
you ever thought this?  Were not these people blessed?  Were they not more
blessed than us?  Jesus was in the world.  He was at a specific location that they
could reach.  Maybe they had to travel a little bit, but they could take
shipping or they could go with their family.  They could actually go to Him and
could talk to Him personally and &ldquo;<b>let [<i>their</i>] requests be made known
unto God</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>face to face</b>.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>Many people thought, &ldquo;I do not even have to talk to Him.  If
I could go to Him and &lsquo;<b>only touch the hem of his garment</b>,&rsquo; if I could
just &lsquo;<b>touch him</b>,&rsquo; I would be healed of my plague,&rdquo; just as the one woman
thought this, as well as others.  There were all these crowds around Him constantly
who just desired to get near Him and to &ldquo;<b>touch him</b>&rdquo; in order to be
healed.  Really, this was a picture of salvation.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that we think this way, that if Jesus were
in downtown Philadelphia, nothing would stop us, not a thing would stop us.  We
would go there immediately.  However, when we talk about prayer, when we think
about going to God, when we go to the Lord Jesus, we are going to the same
person, right?  Exactly the same.  Yes, He was in the world at that time and He
is not in the world in a physical body at this time; but otherwise, He is
exactly the same person with the same characteristics.  He is of the same &ldquo;<b>compassion</b>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<b>mercy</b>&rdquo; and He is &ldquo;<b>gracious</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Today, if we want to go to God, yes, it might be convenient
for us if He was in downtown Philadelphia, but what about the people in India
and the people in China and the people in Africa?  They could not get to Him. 
Actually, Jesus is seated upon &ldquo;<b>the right hand of God</b>&rdquo; in the heavenlies
upon &ldquo;<b>his throne</b>&rdquo; and He is incredibly more accessible today than He
ever has been or than He ever was when He was in the world.  </p>

<p>Is this not true?  We can go to a bathroom and get in a
stall and close our eyes, and we can talk to the very same Lord, the very same Christ
who was in the world, possessing the very same nature.  He is the great &ldquo;<b>Saviour</b>.&rdquo; 
He is &ldquo;<b>merciful</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>kind</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>good</b>.&rdquo; He is the very
same God.  </p>

<p>I do not think that it is really true when people say, &ldquo;If
Jesus were in downtown Philadelphia, I would go to Him quickly.&rdquo;  For most
people, I think that this is not true.  If it were true, we would go to Him
today, in our homes, in our closets.  We would go to Him and talk to Him right
now.  But many people do not, even though there is wide open access.  He is
seated upon the &ldquo;<b>throne of grace</b>&rdquo; and we can go to Him, &ldquo;<b>beseeching
him</b>.&rdquo;  And yet, normally, we find many other better things to do, we
think.  Instead, we do not go to Him and we do not &ldquo;<b>beseech him</b>&rdquo; that He
might save us, yet the time is getting ever shorter, ever shorter.  </p>

<p>This is like an individual who is on his deathbed.  He has
wasted his whole life.  The doctor has told him that he has a very short time
to live.  While he is dying is when he wants to go to God.  Normally, these
instances are not very sincere.  They are brought about because of the terrible
tragedy that they are about to die.  </p>

<p>Of course the church loves this kind of thing.  They send a
priest or they send a pastor and they hear a deathbed confession.  Then the
individual says, &ldquo;Oh, I want God.  I accept Jesus.&rdquo;  Everyone is happy.  Everyone
is content that this person went to be with God in Heaven.  </p>

<p>But it is not true.  It is not true because salvation is
still in God&rsquo;s hands.  We cannot demand of Him to be saved.  We cannot pick the
day and time of our salvation.  We do not know if God will save us on May 20, 2011.  &ldquo;<b>Now</b>&rdquo; the Bible insists is the time.  &ldquo;<b>Now <i>is </i>the day of
salvation</b>,&rdquo; not any future time, never any future time.  </p>

<p>One other thing, and this is what makes this verse stand out
as really shocking that Jesus &ldquo;<b>answered her not a word</b>,&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s great
mercy.  He is just tremendously merciful, and Christ demonstrated this while He
was on earth.  People came to Him who were &ldquo;<b>blind</b>&rdquo; and He gave them &ldquo;<b>sight</b>.&rdquo; 
People came to Him who were &ldquo;<b>deaf</b>&rdquo; and He gave them &ldquo;<b>ears</b>.&rdquo;  People
came to Him who were &ldquo;<b>lame</b>&rdquo; and He gave them the ability to &ldquo;<b>walk</b>.&rdquo; 
He gave an individual with &ldquo;<b>a withered hand</b>&rdquo; a normal hand.  Someone had
their ear cut off by Peter and Jesus restored the whole ear, good as new.  Again,
and again, and again, Christ heard the beseechings of people that He grant them
physical healing.  </p>

<p>Can you think of any occasion in the Bible in the life of Christ,
in the Gospel accounts, when a leper cried out to Him or a blind person cried
out to Him, like &ldquo;<b>blind Bartimaeus</b>&rdquo; who cried &ldquo;<b><i>Thou </i>son of
David, have mercy on me</b>,&rdquo; when Jesus said, &ldquo;No, I do not have time; go away&rdquo;? 
</p>

<p>It is true that Jesus continued to walk on as though He did
not hear Bartimaeus the first time.  Then others noticing Christ continuing on told
him to &ldquo;<b>hold his peace</b>.&rdquo;  It is true that Jesus delayed there.  But
despite what everyone was saying to him, Bartimaeus continued to cry and said,<b>

&ldquo;<i>Thou </i>son of David, have mercy on me</b>.&rdquo;  Then &ldquo;<b>Jesus stood still,
and commanded him to be called</b>&rdquo; and He gave him his request.  </p>

<p>Someone, please tell me where in the Gospel accounts Jesus
refused to hear the cries of some poor soul and refused to give them their
desire.  There is not one, is there?  There is no occasion in the Gospels where
the Lord Jesus, who is God in the flesh, held back from hearing the requests of
people who were coming to Him.  </p>

<p>Before we go on, let me just make this clear, because some
people will hear certain things and then that is all they will hear.  Even
though we are noticing this&mdash;because it is a fact and a truth that Jesus never
turned someone down&mdash;this does not mean that He <span class="underline">must</span> hear our prayers,
that He <span class="underline">must</span> save us, that He is <span class="underline">obligated</span> in any way to hear us,
that if we go to him and ask, like a couple of Bible verses seem to indicate, that
whatever we ask for, He will answer.  </p>

<p>No, some false gospels teach this today&mdash;name it and claim it&mdash;go
to God for what you want; but this is not what the Bible teaches.  God&rsquo;s
perfect will <span class="underline">will</span> be done.  However, the fact that Jesus never turned anyone
away is teaching us about His character, His person, His &ldquo;<b>compassion</b>,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;<b>great love</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>compassion</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>mercy of God</b>,&rdquo; that
He does &ldquo;<b>heal</b>&rdquo; and that He does grant the request of sinful people.  </p>

<p>A little bit further along in Matthew 15, in Matthew
15:30-31, we read:</p>

<p class="verse">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i>those
that were </i>lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus&rsquo; feet; and he healed them: Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when
they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  </p>

<p>Again and again, repeatedly, &ldquo;This is what I am like,&rdquo; God
is telling us.  &ldquo;Look, do you not see?  Do you not understand?  People come to
Me and they are &lsquo;<b>vexed</b>,&rsquo; maybe &lsquo;<b>with a devil</b>.&rsquo;  They are vexed
with an &lsquo;<b>affliction</b>.&rsquo;  They are &lsquo;<b>greatly troubled</b>.&rsquo;  Again and
again and again, I heard them.  I heard them and I granted their request.  Will
you not come to Me?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Does God not encourage us to &ldquo;<b>come boldly unto the throne
of grace</b>&rdquo;?  We are to come &ldquo;<b>b</b><b>oldly</b>,&rdquo; not arrogantly.  It is &ldquo;<b>bold</b>&rdquo;
because we can come at all, that He would accept us in Christ and allow us and
permit us to come.  That is what is &ldquo;<b>bold</b>&rdquo; about it.  But when we come
to Him, we come &ldquo;<b>beseeching him</b>&rdquo; for &ldquo;<b>mercy</b>.&rdquo;  And here He is in
the flesh showing us just how merciful He is.</p>

<p>Let us look at another verse about God&rsquo;s mercy in Psalm 86. 
Psalm 86:15-16 says: </p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Lord, <i>art </i>a God full of compassion, and
gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. O turn unto me, and
have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of
thine handmaid.  </p>

<p>There are numerous verses, too many verses to mention, that
are just like this in the Bible, telling us about God, telling us that He is &ldquo;<b>full
of compassion</b>.&rdquo;   He does not have a little compassion.  He has an abundance
of compassion, far more than we could ever imagine.  He is extremely merciful. </p>

<p>Let us also go to Mark 1:40-41:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus,
moved with compassion, put forth <i>his </i>hand, and touched him, and saith
unto him, I will; be thou clean. </p>

<p>Just like that, right away, He heard.  He answered and the
man was cleansed of his leprosy, and he was like a new man, physically.  Of course,
this is all a picture of salvation and being &ldquo;<b>born again</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what makes it so unusual and so out of the ordinary
that the woman comes to Jesus and &ldquo;<b>He answered her not a word</b>.&rdquo;  It was
not like Him, &ldquo;<b>If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean&hellip;I will</b>.&rdquo;  But with
the woman from Canaan, He put her off.  He ignored her; He did not hear her
right away.  </p>

<p>It is a very serious thing to not answer.  Look at 1 Samuel
28.  In 1 Samuel 28:5-6, we read of Saul, King of Israel.  It says:</p>

<p class="verse">And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
and his heart greatly trembled. And when Saul inquired of JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH
answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.  </p>

<p>He answered Saul not a word.  </p>

<p>Then in verse 15, 1 Samuel 28:15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
me up?&hellip; </p>

<p>After God did not answer Saul, which was a test, Saul fails
the test by going to this witch of Endor.  He seeks another source to help him
in his trouble.  1 Samuel 28:15 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines
make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither
by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make
known unto me what I shall do.  </p>

<p>You see, it is not &ldquo;<b>a light thing</b>&rdquo; when we go to God
in prayer and, seemingly, He does not answer.  In Saul&rsquo;s case, God had departed
from him, which led to Saul&rsquo;s utter destruction.  </p>

<p>When we go to God in prayer and it seems that He does not
answer, this is a test for us.  How are we going to respond?  What are we going
to do when we have poured out our hearts before God and yet our children are
still unsaved or our spouses are still unsaved or our mothers or our fathers
are still unsaved?  &ldquo;I keep praying and praying and praying and yet I do not
see any change in anyone!&rdquo;  This is really how it is with some people, is it
not?  We pray and pray.  &ldquo;God, are you not listening?  Or are you not hearing
my prayer?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, in the account of the Canaanitish woman, Jesus
definitely heard.  He definitely heard; but for His own purposes and for His
own reasons, He did not respond to her at first.  He just let her talk into the
air, &ldquo;Okay, let us see what happens to this lady as I give her a stiff arm to
keep her away.&rdquo;  Yet the woman continued to come.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Matthew 15.  This is after she pleaded for
her daughter.  We read in Matthew 15:23:</p>

<p class="verse">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  </p>

<p>Do you see how they would pick up on the Lord&rsquo;s mannerisms? 
To them, it seemed like He had no interest in this woman, &ldquo;Well, just &lsquo;<b>send
her away</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo;  This is the viewpoint of man, because we do not understand
what God is doing.  But Christ had a very serious purpose in mind, as He
finally answers her in verse 24, Matthew 15:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.  </p>

<p>He is sent to the Israelites, right?  Is it true that Jesus
only came for the Israelites?  Is it true?  </p>

<p>There were Israelites and He did come to save some
Israelites, but &ldquo;<b>the lost sheep of the house of Israel</b>&rdquo; is language that
is telling us that He came to save His elect, and His elect comprise far more
than only Israelites.  They are Canaanites or they are Chinese or they are Indian
or they are African or they are American, too.  They are people from all over
the world, though this was hidden truth.  </p>

<p>But in making this statement at that day and age, it would have
been very easy for this woman to think, &ldquo;Oh, this means that I am left out.  I
am left out.  I am not an Israelite, which is obvious.  I am &lsquo;<b>a Greek, a </b><b>Syrophenician</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>We can see, again, how Jesus, in forming His words in this
way and in making this statement to this woman, is really saying, &ldquo;I have come
for Mine elect.&rdquo;  Yet at the same time, this was hidden truth.  Therefore, she
could easily have been discouraged and put off by it.  </p>

<p>But you know what?  If we go to Mark 3, we find people from
the same area who are being healed.  We read in Mark 3:7-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a
great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, And from Jerusalem,
and from Idumaea, and <i>from </i>beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon&hellip; 
</p>

<p>That is exactly where this woman came out of.  She came out
of &ldquo;<b>the coasts of </b><b>Tyre</b><b> and </b><b>Sidon</b>.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he
did, came unto him. And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should
wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. For he had
healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as
had plagues.  </p>

<p>In other words, people from the same area that this woman was
coming from went to Christ and were healed at an earlier time.  Even more than this,
God healed people from Sidon in the Old Testament.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Luke 4.  In Luke 4:25-26, this is after Jesus
goes into the synagogue and reads from the prophet Isaiah, after which &ldquo;<b>he
closed the book</b>.&rdquo;  He says in Luke 4:25-26:</p>

<p class="verse">But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when
great famine was throughout all the land; But unto none of them was Elias [<i>or
Elijah</i>] sent, save unto Sarepta, <i>a city </i>of Sidon, unto a woman <i>that
was </i>a widow.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>Tyre</b><b> and </b><b>Sidon</b>.&rdquo;  This widow woman that
we read about in the Old Testament was of the same place that this woman is
near as she comes out of &ldquo;<b>the coasts of </b><b>Tyre</b><b> and </b><b>Sidon</b>.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>So when God is saying that He saves &ldquo;<b>the lost sheep of
the house of </b><b>Israel</b>,&rdquo; He is actually indicating that this could
include you.  This is possible.  You are not left out.  There is no human being
from any nation or tongue or tribe that is out of reach of God&rsquo;s salvation. 
There is no one who has sinned so much that God will not save them from that
nation.  However, He does use them from time to time&mdash;like the Moabites whom He
cursed and then makes sure that He saves &ldquo;<b>Ruth the Moabitess</b>&rdquo;&mdash;to let us
know that this does not mean that people from that particular land cannot be
saved.  God can save anyone from any land and from any country in the world: &ldquo;<b>God
is no respecter of persons</b>.&rdquo;   Whoever we are, wherever we come from, it
does not matter.  All are welcome; all are encouraged to come to God.  The cry
goes out to all the world for us to go to Him and &ldquo;<b>beseech him</b>&rdquo; for His
salvation.  </p>

<p>I wanted to look at this because today we know that our time
is short.  What is going to be the most important thing as we get closer and
closer?  It is not going to be our knowledge of certain doctrines.  As we get
closer and closer to this day, the most important item in the world for any one
of us is going to be, &ldquo;Am I a child of God or not?  Am I saved?&rdquo;  If we are a parent,
&ldquo;What about my children?  Are they saved?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God is encouraging us to go to Him now at this time, just like
the Ninevites in Jonah 3.  Before the judgment, Jonah had given the warning: &ldquo;<b>Yet
forty days</b>.&rdquo;  We see &ldquo;<b>time and judgment</b>&rdquo; in this.  It says in Jonah
3:6-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with sackcloth, and
sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and published through
Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor
beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: But
let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea,
let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is </i>in
their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent, and turn away
from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </p>

<p>Their lives were interrupted as they sat in sackcloth and
ashes and fasted.  It was not &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo;  Their lives did not
continue on as normal.  They heard the information, &ldquo;<b>Yet forty days</b>.&rdquo; 
They were told that there was a time that was set for the judgment and there
was a response from the king on down.  </p>

<p>It is interesting how God leaves us right there.  We do not
know how long they fasted and we do not know how long they sat in sackcloth and
ashes.  Did they do it just for that day or did they do this throughout the
whole forty days?  God does not think that it is important for us to know
this.  This is because the point is that their lives were interrupted.  The
analogy for our day is that they were not thinking of school and then college
and then following that with a career or getting married: all the normal things
of life.  Instead, there was a big interruption in their lives to where they
went to God and cried to Him for &ldquo;<b>mercy</b>.&rdquo;  They cried &ldquo;<b>mightily unto God</b>.&rdquo; 
Notice, too, that they did not think that this guaranteed anything because they
said, &ldquo;<b>Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn</b>.&rdquo;  It was a possibility.  </p>

<p>Is it not a wonderful, merciful possibility today that God
is saving &ldquo;<b>a great multitude</b>&rdquo; of people from around the world?  He is
encouraging all people to come to Him and to experience this salvation.  If we
go, we would go &ldquo;<b>boldly</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In the book of Hosea, God also gives us a little instruction
about going to Him and &ldquo;<b>beseeching him</b>&rdquo; for salvation.  In Hosea 14:1,
it says:</p>

<p class="verse">O Israel, return unto JEHOVAH thy God; for thou hast fallen by
thine iniquity.  </p>

<p>This is referring to any of us, because we are sinners,
right?  We are &ldquo;<b>fallen by thine iniquity</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now look at verse 2, Hosea 14:2:</p>

<p class="verse">Take with you words, and turn to JEHOVAH: say unto him, Take
away all iniquity, and receive <i>us </i>graciously: so will we render the
calves of our lips.  </p>

<p>God is instructing us that when we go to the &ldquo;<b>throne of
grace</b>,&rdquo; we are not to go with a formula, as in, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy.  Amen.&rdquo; 
Rather, &ldquo;<b>Take with you words</b>.&rdquo;  What words?  </p>

<p>Well, you can use your own words; that is fine.  You can
say, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a sinner.  My life is a mess and all that I have done in my
life has really done no good.  Here we are coming down to the end and I believe
You God.  I believe Your Word.  I trust Your Word, and yet I still struggle. 
Am I saved?  Am I a child of God?  I do not know.  But, O Lord, I know one
thing.  I know that You are &lsquo;<b>merciful</b>.&rsquo;  You are &lsquo;<b>full of compassion</b>.&rsquo; 
You are &lsquo;<b>full of grace</b>.&rsquo;  You are &lsquo;<b>kind</b>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<b>good</b>&rsquo; and
all of the things that I am not.  O Lord, please, &lsquo;<b>have mercy</b>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<b>have
mercy</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo;   </p>

<p>You can add to this whatever you want; your words are fine. 
&ldquo;<b>Take with you words</b>,&rdquo; your own words.  But we can also go with the
Words of the Bible.  We can go to God like King David, &ldquo;<b>Have mercy upon me,
O God</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us read this in Psalm 51.  This is after David was
greatly convicted of his sin with Bathsheba and with slaying her husband, Uriah
the Hittite.  It says in Psalm 51:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I
acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <i>is </i>ever before me. Against
thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <i>this </i>evil in thy sight: that
thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <i>and </i>be clear when thou
judgest.  </p>

<p>That is, &ldquo;I am a sinner.  Here it all is.  It is all laid
out before Your eyes.  I know that &lsquo;<b>all things <i>are </i>naked and opened</b>&rsquo;
to Your sight anyway.  Here is what I have done with my life.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When I look back at my life, it is not a pretty sight.  How
about you?  When you look back and you see how you have lived and what you have
done, it is not a very pretty thing.  But &ldquo;<b>God <i>is</i> merciful</b>&rdquo; and
He is &ldquo;<b>kind.</b>&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We can go with the words of Luke 18, as Jesus gives us this
great parable.  Luke 18:10-12 says: </p>

<p class="verse">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and
the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I
thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are, </i>extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican.  </p>

<p>Here is a good verse that teaches us what <span class="underline">not</span> to
pray.  This teaches us what <span class="underline">not</span> to say to God:   </p>

<p class="verse">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.  </p>

<p>That is, forget whatever you have done; forget it: &ldquo;<b>Many
will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not&hellip;in thy name done many
wonderful works?</b>&rdquo;  Forget the money that you have given.  Forget the tracts
that you have handed out.  Forget how many hymns you have sung or how often you
have read the Bible.  Forget every work that you could have ever possibly done
and never go to God on these grounds or on this basis, &ldquo;I have no righteousness
of any kind.  All of my &lsquo;<b>righteousnesses <i>are </i>as filthy rags</b>.&rsquo;  There
is nothing in me or of me.  I come because You are merciful, because You are &lsquo;<b>merciful
and gracious</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then it says in verse 13, Luke 18:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
as <i>his </i>eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying&hellip;  </p>

<p>Now, these are the words that we can take to God:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God be merciful to me a sinner.  </p>

<p>Period; this is it: &ldquo;<b>God be merciful to me a sinner</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>So we can go to Him and we can use the words of the Bible.  God
would be very pleased with this, that we are reminding Him of His own Word. 
But it is never because of what we have done.  It is because of what Christ has
done in working out salvation for His people.  </p>

<p>Now, let us go back to Matthew 15 just one more time.  We
read in Matthew 15:24-26: </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help
me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children&rsquo;s bread, and
cast <i>it </i>to dogs.  </p>

<p>This is one stubborn lady, huh?  This is one stubborn lady. 
She will not give up.  </p>

<p>There was one commentator that I read on this passage who
said, &ldquo;With one hand, Christ was pushing her away; and with the other, He was
holding her fast,&rdquo; which is exactly how it is with God&rsquo;s salvation plan.  He
draws us to Himself, and yet it surely seems that we are maybe not one of His
elect at times as we are praying and praying to Him and there seems to be no answer. 
So we keep going.  We keep going back to Him, and we know that God&rsquo;s elect will
and that He will save His people; He will not let them go.  </p>

<p>So here, once again, Jesus is discouraging this woman.  She could
have easily walked away and said, &ldquo;Huh!  I heard that You were &lsquo;<b>full of compassion</b>.&rsquo; 
I heard that You were &lsquo;<b>merciful</b>.&rsquo;  I heard that You were &lsquo;<b>gracious</b>.&rsquo; 
But look at Your response to me.  Look at how You answered me.  You ignored
me.  You put me off.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You see, it was a test throughout the whole time, and yet she
did not walk away because she trusted in the Person of God and in His nature,
that He was all of those things.  She knew that this Person whom she had been
hearing about, the Lord Jesus Christ who was healing all kinds of people all
over the place, that He had to be a &ldquo;<b>loving</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>merciful</b>&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>Saviour</b>.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;He has to be; therefore, I am not going anywhere.  You can try and push me
away, but I am not going anywhere.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues in Matthew 15:27-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters&rsquo; table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman,
great <i>is </i>thy faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>Was this all her &ldquo;<b>faith</b>&rdquo;?  Was this her &ldquo;<b>belief</b>&rdquo;? 
Was this her ability to muster up this kind of spiritual trust in God?  </p>

<p>Absolutely not; absolutely not!  The Bible tells us that
none &ldquo;<b>seek Him&hellip;</b><b>no, not one</b>.&rdquo;  But here she is and she is seeking
and seeking and seeking because the Lord Jesus is the &ldquo;<b>faith</b>&rdquo; that has
saved her.  He is the One holding her fast, not willing to let her go.  It is
He who brought it to completion.  He tested her severely and He tried her very
hard, but He also made sure that she passed.  He also definitely kept her there
until her request was granted.  </p>

<p>By the way, in Mark 7 we find another account of this.  We do
not read this here in Matthew; but in Mark 7:28-30, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
under the table eat of the children&rsquo;s crumbs. And he said unto her, For this
saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. And when she was come
to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. 
</p>

<p>So her daughter was not with her; she was back home
suffering and &ldquo;<b>vexed with a devil</b>.&rdquo;  The mother went to Christ and &ldquo;<b>fell
at his feet</b>&rdquo; and cried out stubbornly, beseechingly for her daughter.  Then
she traveled home after Jesus granted her request.  She went into her house and
found that her daughter was fine; her daughter was normal.   </p>

<p>Another thing that we tend to think is what a blessing it
would be to go to Jesus in person so that He could heal us right there on the
spot.  Yet it is totally and completely unnecessary for us to go physically to
God.  It is impossible today anyway to go to Jesus in this manner and it is
unnecessary because God can heal long distance.  </p>

<p>Do you remember the Roman centurion who sent &ldquo;<b>the elders
of the Jews</b>&rdquo; to Jesus because one of his trusted servants was ill?  Even
the Jews said, &ldquo;This man &lsquo;<b>was worthy for whom he should do this</b>,&rsquo;
because &lsquo;<b>he hath built us a synagogue</b>.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Of course, this same man who sent
these messengers said, &ldquo;<b>I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my
roof</b>,&rdquo; but &ldquo;<b>I am a man under authority</b>&rdquo; like You, &ldquo;<b>and I say to
this <i>man, </i>Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh</b>.&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>When
Jesus heard <i>it, </i>he marvelled</b>,&rdquo;<b> </b>at his faith because He had
not seen that kind of faith even in Israel.  Then He said, &ldquo;<b><i>S</i></b><b><i>o

</i></b><b>be it done unto thee</b>&rdquo; as you desire.  Then the servants went
home.  </p>

<p>Actually, this is in two different Gospel accounts.  One
seems to indicate that the man was there.  The other seems to indicate that &ldquo;<b>the
elders of the Jews</b>&rdquo; were there.  But the man found that &ldquo;<b>his servant was
healed in the selfsame hour</b>&rdquo; in which Jesus had said these words.  He
healed him.  </p>

<p>We do not know how many miles away He was, but does it
matter?  Whether it was a mile away or a hundred miles away or all the way into
Heaven, does it matter?  This does not really come into the equation.  It does
not matter if Jesus is in downtown Philadelphia or if He is seated upon the &ldquo;<b>throne</b>&rdquo;

in Heaven.  It is actually far better that He is seated upon the &ldquo;<b>throne</b>&rdquo;
in Heaven because He does not have to personally touch someone.  He does not personally
have to heal someone.  He can do it right from the &ldquo;<b>throne</b>&rdquo; where He
is.   </p>

<p>So we can go to Him by His grace because of this great
privilege that He has given us.  We can go to Him and we can pray, &ldquo;&lsquo;<b>Have
mercy</b>.&rsquo;  Save me, O Lord.  &lsquo;<b>I am not worthy that thou shouldest come
under my roof: but speak the word only</b>&rsquo; and it will be as You command. 
Just say it from Heaven, &lsquo;<b>Say unto my soul, I <i>am</i> thy salvation</b>.&rsquo; 
Speak to my heart.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Matthew 15 is a beautiful passage that is teaching the
principle that we should not &ldquo;<b>faint</b>.&rdquo;  We should not &ldquo;<b>faint</b>&rdquo;; we
should not give up.  If you remember, Jacob &ldquo;<b>wrestled</b>&rdquo; with God?  We
know that God could have destroyed him, but God let Jacob wrestle with Him.  What
was Jacob&rsquo;s desire, his plea?  Jacob said, &ldquo;<b>I will not let thee go, except
thou bless me</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the principle that God wants us to know: &ldquo;Do not let
go.  Do not &lsquo;<b>faint</b>.&rsquo;  Do not stop now.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You have come this far, almost to the very edge of the end
of the world.  Is this the time to draw back?  Is this the time to &ldquo;<b>faint</b>&rdquo;? 
Is this the time to doubt the &ldquo;<b>goodness</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>mercy of God</b>&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Maybe He has not answered you yet, but there is still time. 
There is still time.  So think on the nature of Christ, think of how merciful
He is.  </p>

<p>Let us just read this in closing. In Luke 18:1-6, we read:</p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge,
which feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city;
and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not
for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor
regard man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge
saith.  </p>

<p>This was an &ldquo;<b>u</b><b>njust judge,</b>&rdquo; a sinner.  A wicked
man heard her plea because she was very annoying, &ldquo;She is really disturbing
me.  She just keeps coming, so I will grant what she wants.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Or go a little bit back.  I know I said that this would be
the last verse, but let us look at one more in Luke 11, which gets into the
whole matter of asking and seeking after God. In Luke 11:11-13, this is the
point behind what He had in mind in asking and seeking.  God says:</p>

<p class="verse">If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
give him a stone? or if <i>he ask </i>a fish, will he for a fish give him a
serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then,
being evil&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are &ldquo;<b>unjust</b>,&rdquo; just like this judge.  If we:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more
shall <i>your </i>heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?  </p>

<p>Again, look at the nature of God.  Look at how &ldquo;<b>just</b>,&rdquo;
how &ldquo;<b>holy</b>,&rdquo; how &ldquo;<b>right</b>,&rdquo; how &ldquo;<b>good</b>,&rdquo; and how &ldquo;<b>loving</b>&rdquo;

He is compared to anything in this world.</p>

<p>Let us close with a word of prayer.  </p>

<p>Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank You for time.  It is also
part of Your mercy that there is still a space of time available where You are
still saving.  The door is not shut.  The door is open, &ldquo;<b>a great door and
effectual</b>.&rdquo;  We know that You are the Door and the Way and that You are
still operating in the world and saving a &ldquo;<b>great multitude</b>.&rdquo;  Father, we
ask, those of us who are saved, that You would permit us to be humble &ldquo;<b>doorkeepers</b>,&rdquo;
that You would allow us to minister the Gospel, which from Your blessing can
enable people to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.  May You help us to work in
this area more and more as this Day is approaching, and may You also help us to
pray, to strive and fight in prayer, to go to You beseeching that one of our
loved ones or one of our friends or just anyone whom we know, may we pray for
them and may we pray diligently.  May we come to You in the manner in which You
would have us to come.  Father, we ask that we would take &ldquo;<b>words</b>&rdquo; with
us.  We know that You do not hear for &ldquo;<b>much speaking</b>,&rdquo; but You do tell
us to take &ldquo;<b>words</b>,&rdquo; words that we are to offer to You, yet all the words
that we could come up with would only show that we are undeserving.  The only
grounds for Your hearing would be because of what Christ has done.  Father, we
do pray that You would be with each one of us as individuals, as You continue
to work with individuals in the world until the end.  May You be with each one
of us as we go home.  May You strengthen us and encourage us by Your Word
today, this Sabbath, this Holy Day.  We pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s Name. 
Amen.  </p>
