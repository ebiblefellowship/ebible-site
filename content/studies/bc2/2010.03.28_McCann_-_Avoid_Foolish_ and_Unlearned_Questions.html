<p>Please turn to 2 Timothy 2 where I will begin reading in
verse 23.  We read in 2 Timothy 2:23-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all<i>, </i>apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose
themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging
of the truth; And <i>that </i>they may recover themselves out of the snare of
the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.  </p>

<p>This is the passage that I wanted to look at today.  </p>

<p>Let me read 2 Timothy 2:23 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strifes.  </p>

<p>Have you ever heard someone say, &ldquo;There is no such thing as
a dumb question&rdquo;?  Maybe this is true, but God says that there certainly are
such things as &ldquo;foolish and unlearned questions.&rdquo;  He also tells us what to do
if we are faced with &ldquo;foolish and unlearned questions.&rdquo;  We are to avoid them. 
</p>

<p>I was trying to think of a foolish question as an example to
give for what God says here.  I think that I have heard this and that you have
also probably heard this recently, but someone will come to me and say, &ldquo;Show
me where in the Bible it says that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is not foolish if what they mean is, &ldquo;Show me the
Biblical evidence.&rdquo;  However, what some people try to do is to say, &ldquo;Show me a
verse where it is written very plainly in the Bible that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, we cannot show them a verse like this because the
verse does not exist.  But, you see, they know this.  They know that there is
no verse that definitely states outright that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>So we try to explain to them that we need to compare &ldquo;spiritual
things with spiritual,&rdquo; that God has sealed up His Word &ldquo;till the time of the
end,&rdquo; and that He has placed in the Bible a Biblical calendar of history, which
is very exact.  We go on to explain that when we put all of these things
together, we find that the Bible is teaching that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Of course, most of the time, all of this just goes in one
ear and out the other.  Then they say, &ldquo;You have yet to show me in the Bible
where it says that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  You have not done this yet.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>So this is a foolish question because they really do not
want an answer.  They just want to present something that is favorable to their
point of view and their own understanding of the Bible.  They want this
desperately not to be true, and so they will ask a question like this knowing
that it cannot be answered.  </p>

<p>This is similar to when we were having discussions with the
Muslims.  They would ask a question like, &ldquo;Show me in the Bible where Jesus
very directly says that He is God.&rdquo;  Yet in the Bible, we know that Jesus says
this all over the place.  He says, &ldquo;Before Abraham was, I am.&rdquo;  The Bible
states that He is &ldquo;the Creator.&rdquo;  The Bible says that He was &ldquo;the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Word was made flesh.&rdquo; 
It is just all over the Bible that Jesus is God.  In Isaiah, it says of the Son
that His name shall be &ldquo;The everlasting Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;The mighty God.&rdquo;  But
because Jesus did not specifically say this, they fail to understand that Christ
is the Word and that He wrote the whole Bible.  </p>

<p>So you can point out many of these verses.  You can point
out that when Thomas saw Jesus after His resurrection and Jesus said, &ldquo;Reach
hither thy finger,&rdquo; and so forth, that Thomas exclaimed, &ldquo;My Lord and my God.&rdquo; 
 Christ did not correct him as He definitely should have if He were not God. 
Instead, He said, &ldquo;Thomas&hellip;thou hast believed,&rdquo; which confirmed that this was an
absolute truth.  Christ is God.  Christ is eternal God.  </p>

<p>So the Muslims frame the question this way, &ldquo;Show me where
Jesus says this in the Bible,&rdquo; for example, a made up verse like John 15:80&mdash;I
do not think that there is an 80<sup>th</sup> verse in John 15&mdash;which states, &ldquo;By
the way, I am eternal God.&rdquo;  But no, God does not make this kind of a
statement.  </p>

<p>So when someone says, &ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; it is a foolish question
because they really do not want to know.  They want to ask a question that they
know cannot be answered.  It is not a seeking after the truth with these types
of questions, but it is a seeking after their own point of view and their own
understanding of what the Bible says because they do not want to hear the
truth.  They do not want to hear the information from the Bible that proves this. 
No, &ldquo;Just show me the verse.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God tells us that if we are faced with this kind of a
question, avoid it.  This word for &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;reject.&rdquo; 
Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that you cannot respond to the person;
but at some point you are going to have to say, &ldquo;I am sorry.  I cannot keep
this conversation going with you because you are not listening.  You are not
listening to the Bible,&rdquo; and then you just move on.  </p>

<p>This happens a lot when you are handing out tracts, too. 
You are handing out tracts when someone comes up and wants to get into a
conversation with you about something in the Bible and maybe it this question
of, &ldquo;Where in the Bible does it say May 21.&rdquo;  Then after a couple of minutes,
you realize that this is not very productive.  It is not fruitful.  People are
passing you by who are not getting tracts because you are standing there having
a conversation with a person who does not even want to hear the answers from
the Bible, and so we just politely say, &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; and then we turn our
attention back to the people who are coming and going.  We avoid the question. 
</p>

<p>As far as &ldquo;unlearned questions&rdquo; are concerned, the word &ldquo;unlearned&rdquo;
is made up of two Greek words.  One is a negative particle that just means &ldquo;no.&rdquo; 
The other word that is attached to this word is a word that means &ldquo;taught&rdquo; or &ldquo;learned,&rdquo;

and so it means &ldquo;not taught&rdquo; or &ldquo;not learned.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Referring to the Bible itself, if someone is asking a question
that is not something that is wholesome or good or not something that the Bible
would teach, remember that &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; can also mean &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;reject.&rdquo;  It
does not only mean to go away from it or to turn away from it.  </p>

<p>What is an example of an unlearned question?  An unlearned
question is when people say, &ldquo;What are you going to do on May 22<sup>nd</sup>
when this does not happen?  What are you going to do then?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We answer them just as we have heard Mr. Camping answer them
in a good way.  He says, &ldquo;Well, what am I going to do if God is not the
Saviour?&rdquo;  I do not think that Mr. Camping has said what I am adding to this,
but he could say, &ldquo;What am I going to do if the Bible is not the Word of God?&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>We make these kinds of statements because we know that the
Bible teaches that Christ <span class="underline">is</span> the Saviour, and we know that the Bible
teaches that the Bible <span class="underline">is</span> the Word of God, and we know that the Bible
teaches that May 21, 2011 <span class="underline">is</span> Judgment Day.  So it is right and it is
correct, according to 2 Timothy 2:23, to avoid this question because they are
not really interested in all of this information from the Bible that proves
this date, with all of the confirmations that God has given, such as 2011 being
the 7,000<sup>th</sup> year from the flood and May 21 being the 8400<sup>th</sup>

day of the 23-year Great Tribulation period.  Also on that very day, in the
Hebrew calendar, this is the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month,
which fits in perfectly with the day that God shut the door on Noah&rsquo;s ark. 
After a warning of &ldquo;yet seven days,&rdquo; God shut the door on the ark and He
secured the safety of Noah and his family.  In the same act, He also made it
impossible for anyone else to get into the ark because what God &ldquo;shutteth&hellip;no
man openeth.&rdquo;  Yet people want to keep bringing this up, &ldquo;What are you going to
do?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I like to think of Noah when God said to him, &ldquo;Yet seven
days,&rdquo; which was the 10<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of Noah&rsquo;s
600<sup>th</sup> year.  Noah had one week, and Noah being a &ldquo;preacher of
righteousness&rdquo; would have sent forth this information as far and as wide as he
could have for the remaining time that he had left.  He would have told
everyone that the judgment of God and the wrath of God through a flood was just
a certain number of days away.  He had just a very short period of time left
and it is very possible that Noah would have had neighbors and people who were
concerned who would have come to him and said, &ldquo;Noah, you are saying that this
is going to be on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  What
are you going to do on the 18<sup>th</sup> day?  What are you going to do on that
18<sup>th</sup> day when this does not happen?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Would this have been a wise question for someone to have
asked Noah?  Or would this have been an unlearned question, since God had told
this to Noah directly?  This information of when the flood would be came to Noah
right from the mouth of God, and so Noah would have said to others, &ldquo;God told
me.  God is the one.&rdquo;  Yet since others do not want to accept this and believe
this and since doubt is in their mind, they would say to someone like Noah, &ldquo;What
about the 18<sup>th</sup> day?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Noah would not have entertained this question because it
would have been pointless.  Noah would have most likely said, &ldquo;God told me that
in seven days, the flood is coming.  So I am not going to think about the 18<sup>th</sup>
day.  You should not either because on the 18<sup>th</sup> day, the waters are
going to rise and you are going to be in serious trouble, along with everyone
else in the world.  Here you are wasting time, precious time, valuable time.  There
is nothing but a few days remaining until this day of judgment, and yet you are
all concerned about foolish and unlearned questions.&rdquo;  Noah could have also
said to them, &ldquo;Do you not think that it is time for you to just believe God and
act upon this?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Ninevites heard a message concerning &ldquo;time and judgment&rdquo;
when Jonah warned, &ldquo;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.&rdquo;  Period. 
He said nothing more, nothing additional, no &ldquo;signs and wonders,&rdquo; no miracles. 
He was a foreigner who just came into their city and declared a bold and
outlandish thing when he said, &ldquo;The great city of Nineveh is going to be
destroyed.&rdquo;  They had no evidence that we know of to believe him, and yet they
did believe what he said.  They did not pester him with &ldquo;foolish and unlearned
questions,&rdquo; which anyone can do.  They did not say to Jonah, &ldquo;How do we know
that God said this?  We do not know you.  We do not know anything about you. 
Our religious people do not know anything about this forty days.  Why do we not
know?&rdquo; and just go on and on and on.  </p>

<p>If someone wants to respond in a contrary way to what God
has said, they are free to do so.  They can do this in a thousand different
ways; and yet all the while that they are doing this, time is elapsing, time is
passing, time is fleeting away.  This is not helpful to them in any way, and so
God tells us to avoid these kinds of questions.  </p>

<p>Jesus also avoided them.  If we go to Matthew 21:23-27, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what
authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? And Jesus
answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell
me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The
baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with
themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did
ye not then believe him? But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for
all hold John as a prophet. And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell.
And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
</p>

<p>They asked a foolish question.  Actually, when the scribes
and Pharisees would often come to Him, their questions were of such a character
that they wanted to trap Jesus.  They were &ldquo;foolish and unlearned questions,&rdquo;
and so not every question is a good question.  Many questions are raised in
order to promote the viewpoint of the one who is raising them.  </p>

<p>When we read of these leaders of Israel faced with a
question, is it not sad to see them huddle up and get together and say, &ldquo;If we
say this, He will say that; if we say this other thing, He will say that other
thing&rdquo;?  Are they seeking truth?  Are they seeking truth or are they seeking some
kind of political maneuver that they can get out of the question that they are
asking?  </p>

<p>Is this not a keen insight into the churches and
congregations of our day and the spiritual leaders within the church?  Are they
really interested in truth?  Are they really seeking truth concerning Judgment
Day being next year on May 21?  Or do they just want an answer that is going to
preserve their church?  The Bible teaches that the church age is over, so do
they just want an answer that is going to preserve the people who are in their
congregation and protect their whole system of worship?  Are they really going
to the Bible as Bereans, nobly and honorably, searching the Scriptures to see &ldquo;whether
those things were so&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>No, they are not.  They are not investigating the Bible. 
They think that they can just say, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour,&rdquo; and that
this statement will just make this all go away.  They think that it causes this
to just disappear and that there will be no more threat of judgment.  </p>

<p>No; on this issue of the day or hour, just like everything
else, we have to search the whole Bible and check it out to see if it is true. 
We have to check everything out that God has to say.  Then we also realize
that, of ourselves, we cannot know.  However, once God determines to give this
information and this knowledge to His people who are alive at the time of the
end where we now are, then, of course, we can know.  Of course; it is as simple
as that.  This is how God has worked this out.  </p>

<p>Going back to 2 Timothy 2:23, we read:    </p>

<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender <span class="underline">strifes</span>.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;strifes&rdquo; is a word that has to do with fighting,
as we read in James 4:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">From whence <i>come </i>wars and <span class="underline">fightings</span> among you? <i>come
they </i>not hence, <i>even </i>of your lusts that war in your members?  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;fightings&rdquo; is the same as the word for &ldquo;strifes.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>So 2 Timothy 2:23 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;foolish and unlearned questions&hellip;<span class="underline">gender</span> strifes.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;begat,&rdquo; like in
Matthew 1 where we read that so-and-so begat someone.  It is also translated as
&ldquo;begotten&rdquo; and as &ldquo;born,&rdquo; like in John 3 where we read, &ldquo;Ye must be <span class="underline">born</span>

again.&rdquo;  It is this same word that is found in many places in the New
Testament.  </p>

<p>So &ldquo;foolish and unlearned questions&rdquo; will give birth to
strifes, to fightings, to arguments.  If the believer tries to continue having
a discussion with a person when this person has already indicated that they
have closed their ears and shut their eyes, the only thing that can come of
this is strife.  In other words, there is no point for someone who is a child
of God to get involved with these types of questions that are unprofitable and that
will not bring any good at all.  It is only something that will develop
striving.  </p>

<p>Then God says in 2 Timothy 2:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive&hellip;  </p>

<p>We cannot strive.  &ldquo;The servant of the Lord&rdquo; is anyone whom
God has saved.  All of us are servants of the Lord, as it says in Ephesians
6:5-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Servants, be obedient to them that are <i>your </i>masters
according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart,
as unto Christ; Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ,
doing the will of God from the heart; With good will doing service, as to the
Lord, and not to men:  </p>

<p>So we are servants of God.  We are servants of the Lord
Jesus Christ and we want to do things His way.  God reveals His will to us
through the Bible.  We learn what the Bible says and then we just simply follow
it.  By God&rsquo;s grace, we are obedient to God&rsquo;s commands.  And in 2 Timothy 2:24, this is one of God&rsquo;s commands:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be <span class="underline">gentle</span>
unto all <i>men, </i>apt to teach, patient,  </p>

<p>We are never right about what we are doing if what we are
doing gets us into an argument.  If we are striving about the Law, the Bible,
it is never proper and it is never correct, but it is easy to do.  </p>

<p>It is especially easy to do when we are so concerned for our
families and we are trying to tell them about May 21 being Judgment Day.  We
tell them, &ldquo;This is it.  This is going to happen!&rdquo;  As we are sharing this,
there is someone in the family who knows us very well and knows how to push our
buttons.  Before you know it, there is a commotion and there could be striving
and there could be fighting and arguing.  But God says that this should never happen. 
</p>

<p>If we are talking to someone on Paltalk or if we are handing
out tracts when someone stops and wants to talk to us but rejects the whole
idea of anyone knowing the end by claiming, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour,&rdquo; at
first we patiently try to explain, &ldquo;This is how we understand this.  Here is
why what you are saying does not apply to our day when God has opened up the
seals from the Bible and He is teaching us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If they do not listen and even more strongly declare, &ldquo;No
man knows the day or hour,&rdquo; the natural reaction is to raise our voices and
say, &ldquo;Look, you do not know what you are talking about.  Let me show you this
verse.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If they still insist, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour,&rdquo; before
you know it, you have two people standing on a street corner arguing and
possibly shouting at one another in loud voices.  This does not glorify God in
any way.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the servant of the Lord must not strive&hellip;</p>

<p>We are not to fight.  We are to present the Gospel in a kind
way and in a gentle way, as God goes on to say in 2 Timothy 2:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be <span class="underline">gentle</span>
unto all <i>men, </i>apt to teach, patient,</p>

<p>So we are gentle with others.  This word &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; is also
used in 1 Thessalonians 2:7 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But we were <span class="underline">gentle</span> among you, even as a nurse cherisheth
her children:  </p>

<p>This would be referring to how a woman takes care of a
baby.  This is how gentle God is saying that we should be with others.  We
should be treating them as carefully as a baby&rsquo;s nurse would treat them as they
hold the baby and care for the baby and change its diaper.  We should be
treating others with this same softness.  </p>

<p>We must be gentle and soft and kind with a baby, which is
evident when we see a mother saying sweet little nothings to her baby.  This is
the nature that God is saying the servant of the Lord must have.  This is the
kind of attitude that we must have.  We need to realize that these people are
in great danger and that arguing with them is never going to work.  This will
never convince them, and so God says that we are to treat them as a nurse who
cherishes her children.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;cherisheth&rdquo; is also found in Ephesians 5:29: 

</p>

<p class="verse">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and <span class="underline">cherisheth</span>
it, even as the Lord the church:  </p>

<p>How do we take care of ourselves?  We normally do pretty
well.  How does Christ take care of the Church?  How does He nourish and
cherish the Church?  He does so in great kindness and in everlasting love.  He
is our example that we are to follow, &ldquo;Who, when he was reviled, reviled not
again.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When people came up to Him to tempt Him, He might have
avoided the question in one way or another, but He never shot back at them.  We
never read of Him raising His voice and shouting and yelling, except for when
He overturned the tables of the moneychangers, but that was only to teach us
something about God overturning the churches and the congregations.  Of course,
 Christ was not subject to serving His own emotions.  He was perfect and holy
and He perfectly did the will of God.  </p>

<p>Returning to 2 Timothy, it says in 2 Timothy 2:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves&hellip;  </p>

<p>If you turn to Titus 3, there is a similar account.  I will
start reading in verse 1.  Titus 3:1-6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, To speak evil of no man, to
be no brawlers, <i>but </i>gentle, showing all meekness unto all men. For we
ourselves also were sometimes&hellip;  </p>

<p>I think that this is the word that should be translated &ldquo;aforetime.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p class="verse">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish&hellip;  </p>

<p>We, ourselves, were foolish, and so we should be able to
relate.  We were also:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and </i>hating one another. But after
that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, Not by works
of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by
the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on
us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;  </p>

<p>It was the kindness and the love of God, our Saviour, that
came to us, people who are desperately wicked, foolish, ignorant, rebellious,
guilty of all of the same sins as anyone else out there, and yet the way in
which God came to us was very kind, gentle, meek and lowly.  He brought His
Gospel to us and we heard it.  </p>

<p>The Word itself is an offense.  The Bible tells us that
people are often offended at what the Bible says, but God indicates that those
who carry the Bible&rsquo;s message are not to be the offense.  We have to keep in
mind that we are water bearers.  We are servants.  We are ambassadors.  We are
doorkeepers.  We are lowly servants.  Even if we did everything perfectly, in
the end of all things, God says that we could only say that we are &ldquo;unprofitable
servants.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is our position.  This is our role.  We are not the
ones who have devised the Gospel and who is teaching all of these things.  We
are just the ones whom God has revealed this to and made these things known so
that we can share this with others.  </p>

<p>So we gently carry this message from God to other people. 
We do not get so wrapped up in doing this that if anyone is opposing the
message, we take it as if they are opposing us and respond in a strident way.  God
says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Again, 2 Timothy 2:24-25 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all <i>men, </i>apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that
oppose themselves&hellip;  </p>

<p>There is another saying that people have: you are your own
worst enemy.  How true this is!  </p>

<p>Why are people going to perish?  Why are they going to be
eternally destroyed &ldquo;from the presence of the Lord&rdquo;?  Whose fault is this?  Who
bears this responsibility when people are in such a situation in their lives
that they do their own thing and go their own way and do not want to go to God
on His terms and beseech Him for mercy and cry out that He might save them?  They
just go on, day after day after day, which is just taking them ever closer to
this Day of Judgment.  Whose fault is this?  </p>

<p>It is not God&rsquo;s fault.  It is the individual&rsquo;s fault.  Man,
in his natural state, opposes God&mdash;yes&mdash;opposes the Bible&mdash;yes&mdash;but in doing so, he
opposes his very own soul, because there is only one way of escape.  There is
only one deliverance that God has made possible.  It is through Christ, through
the hearing of His Word.  </p>

<p>If people reject this and despise this, if they just do not
follow up when they hear the Gospel message, it is because they love their
sin.  They love this world.  In doing so, they are their own worst enemy.  </p>

<p>It says in Proverbs 5:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
be holden with the cords of his sins. He shall die without instruction; and in
the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  </p>

<p>Who is the one who has the cords, the chains of bondage
wrapped around him?  It is the individual sinner himself.  It is his sin.  It
is his iniquity that is keeping him in bondage, that is keeping him under the
snare of the devil and in captivity to sin and to Satan.  It is the individual
person who bears this responsibility before God, whether adult or child.  </p>

<p>So God is telling His people who are carrying the Gospel to
the world to understand this.  We are to understand this, as God said to
Samuel, &ldquo;for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me.&rdquo;  We are
to understand why they reject this.  It is because they are their own worst enemy. 
They are the ones who are bringing themselves down to the grave.  They are the
ones who are bringing themselves into &ldquo;everlasting destruction from the
presence of the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is not something that we are to get angry about with
them.  This is something that should cause us to have pity and compassion
towards them, because we were in the same situation.  We ourselves opposed
ourselves at one point; and yet due to God&rsquo;s mercy, He delivered us.  </p>

<p>So, too, when we share the Word of God, we need to do so
very gently and compassionately.  We need to do this without thinking that
others are being hostile towards us, because they are not understanding what we
are saying.  We are to be careful, therefore, to not allow this situation to
lead to strife.  This should never happen.</p>

<p>It goes on to say in 2 Timothy 2:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;  </p>

<p>This verse has always had something to do with salvation at
any point when the Gospel has gone out into the world, but this verse takes on
special significance at this time because 2 Timothy 3:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
</p>

<p>In this context, look at 2 Timothy 3:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth.  </p>

<p>God has opened up the Bible.  He is revealing truth, and yet
there are many who are not coming to the knowledge of the truth.  Here, God
says that they are &ldquo;never able.&rdquo;  This is language that God uses, for example,
in Hebrews 6 where it speaks of the impossibility of repentance.  </p>

<p>This type of language applies to our day when God is
finished with the churches and there is no salvation taking place within the
congregations.  They are still studying the Bible for their own purposes, but
they are not coming to the knowledge of the truth.  As a matter of fact, they
cannot come to the knowledge of the truth in their present situation of being
in the church.  </p>

<p>This is also found in Hebrews 10:26, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  </p>

<p>Again, the only time this verse applies is in our day when
there is no salvation in the churches and congregations; and so, for them,
there is no more sacrifice for sins.  There is no more forgiveness possible. 
God relates this to them not receiving the knowledge of the truth because they
are rejecting it and turning away from it.  </p>

<p>The last part of 2 Timothy 2:25 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth;  </p>

<p>Repentance is not something that we hear out in the world at
all.  The world thinks that it can repent of maybe some things that are
troubling to them, things that are a problem in their lives with their
families, like drinking.  Maybe this sin is also developing a problem at work. 
Yet true repentance has to do with turning away from our own hearts.  </p>

<p>We can repent of outward sins, and God is telling us to do
this at this time.  We are to turn away from drinking.  We are to turn away
from drugs.  We are to turn away from lying.  We are to turn away from
stealing.  We are to turn away from adultery.  We are to turn away from this
sin and from that sin.  If we see it in our lives, repent and turn away from
it.  </p>

<p>Although if someone does, if someone has some success&mdash;since it
is possible to get away from a sin as attested to by the many people who are
involved in Alcoholics Anonymous who were drunkards and who ruined their homes&mdash;yet
apart from the power of God, they are a not saved individuals.  They might have
been able to turn from the sin of drinking.  Of course, it took a lot for them
to do this.  They had to get a sponsor and maybe call them up to fives times a
night in the early going, which just shows us the power of sin.  This just
shows us the power of the hold of sin upon a person.  But, finally, they were
successful and they are no longer drinking, and yet they are still doing a
whole lot of other things.  </p>

<p>But this is not repentance.  If we turn from any outward
sin, this is good and this is what God wants us to do, but this is not the end
of repentance.  There must finally be a turning from our own hearts because sin
flows out of the heart.  All manner of iniquity flows forth from the heart of
man.  So to cut off a stream here or there is not dealing with the source of
where it is all coming from, which is from the very nature of a person.  This
is why God is commanding us to repent.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Acts 17 to prove this.  In Acts 17:29-31, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art
and man&rsquo;s device. And the times of this ignorance God winked at&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is all history past.  These people died and came under
the judgment of God.  They died and ceased to be, and there will be no further
punishment except on May 21 when their bones or whatever is left of them comes
up out of the ground.  At that point, God will make them a shame, as they are
left out under the sun.  God will later utterly destroy them with &ldquo;fervent heat&rdquo;
on October 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>This is all part of the judgment.  But as far as what the
unsaved who have already died will know, they will not experience this.  When
they come up out of the ground, they will not have conscious existence.  They
are not going to know anything about this five-month period.  </p>

<p>So God is saying that He winked at this.  He winked at this
all through history.  But now, in our day, He is no longer winking at this.  As
this passage continues, He says:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Because he
hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by <i>that
</i>man whom he hath ordained&hellip;  </p>

<p>This appointed day is May 21, 2011.  He had always appointed this to be the day.  From the very beginning, this has always been Judgment
Day and God has known this.  Now at the end, He is revealing this to His
people.  Now that we know the appointed day, we are to repent.  </p>

<p>This is what He is saying.  He is commanding this.  The
whole Bible is a Law Book that is full of commands and God is speaking to each
and every person: two-year-olds, ten-year-olds, twenty-year-olds, and
eighty-year-olds.  God is commanding everyone to repent.  Every single creature
is being given a command from the Creator.  We are to repent because He is not
going to wink at our sin any longer on this appointed day.  For these five
months, anyone left behind will experience torment, a time of great sorrow and
sadness.  It will be an awful thing for anyone to be left behind on this day
and to live on this earth for however long they manage into this five-month
period.  This will not be anything pleasant, and so God is commanding everyone
to repent.  </p>

<p>So what do we do?  A great example is what we find in Jonah
3 when they were given knowledge of an appointed day.  When Jonah said, &ldquo;Yet
forty days,&rdquo; an appointed day of judgment was set for them.  They would have
known precisely that in forty days, on a particular day, they were going to die
and their city was going to be destroyed.  </p>

<p>It says in Jonah 3:6-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with sackcloth,
and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and published
through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink
water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto
God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that

<i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent, and
turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </p>

<p>Once they heard the time that judgment was set, they had
heard both things, &ldquo;time and judgment,&rdquo; and then there was repentance.  There
was repentance from the Ninevites.  From the king on down, they sat in
sackcloth and ashes and fasted, which is just language that shows us that their
lives were interrupted.  They did not go on living as they normally did, like
the people before the flood who continued &ldquo;eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage,&rdquo; or like those in Sodom and Gomorrah where the Bible says, &ldquo;they
did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, the lives of the Ninevites where interrupted and they
realized that repentance was the most important thing.  What did it matter if
they married and gave in marriage if in forty days they died?  What did it
matter to be concerned with eating and drinking and the nourishment of their
bodies if in forty days they were going to die?  </p>

<p>So God is indicating that when an appointed day is known,
then it activates this command.  Prior to this command, He winked at sin; but
now, God commands all men everywhere to repent, to turn, to turn from sin.  </p>

<p>Do we put forth effort?  Or do we wait for God to move in
us?  Do we do anything?  Well, the Ninevites did something, and so I think it
would be a good thing for anyone to throw away the cigarettes, to get away from
this sin or that sin, whatever it is that they are doing, and go to the Lord
and beseech Him that He might have mercy.  </p>

<p>In Jeremiah 31:18-19, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself <i>thus; </i>Thou
hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed <i>to the
yoke: </i>turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou <i>art </i>JEHOVAH my
God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
instructed&hellip;  </p>

<p>So we can go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am turning away
from this outward sin but I know that this is not going to save me.  I know
that there has to be a deeper repentance that comes from my inner being, which
is something that I cannot do.  Just as the Israelites could not circumcise
their hearts, I cannot change my heart.  I cannot repent from the sins of my
heart.  I need a new heart.&rdquo;  And so the prayer is, &ldquo;Lord, turn me.  Give me
repentance.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what 2 Timothy 2:25 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth;  </p>

<p>This is a gift of God, just like all of His others gifts. 
He gives the gift of faith, as well as the gift of repentance.  All the
spiritual blessings that God gives His people are gifts.  No one can believe
unto salvation and no one of themselves can repent unto salvation.  This has to
be something that God has done.  </p>

<p>This is what He will do in the heart of a sinner whom He
saves.  If He turns us, then we will turn in a very pleasing and satisfying way
to God.  </p>

<p>We do not have time to get into the next verse, so we will
stop here.  </p>
