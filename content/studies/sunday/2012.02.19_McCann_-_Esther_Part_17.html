description: |
  A look at Esther 8:1-6.  
  A review of the evidence for May 21, 2011 being the start of spiritual Judgment Day.
  The doubling of the five months of judgment requires that God gives a law for it.
  In Esther, the ten months of judgment is emphasized, not the five months.
  The king giving and taking the ring from Haman, relates to God giving and taking authority 
  from Satan.
