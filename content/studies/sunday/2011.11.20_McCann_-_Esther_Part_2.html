<p>If we could turn to the book of Esther, chapter one, we will
pick this up in verse 3.  We read in Esther 1:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes
of the provinces, <i>being </i>before him: When he showed the riches of his
glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, <i>even </i>and
hundred and fourscore days. And when these days were expired, the king made a
feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto
great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</p>

<p>So the book of Esther begins with King Ahasuerus who ruled
over 127 provinces holding a feast for six months or 180 days.  It says &ldquo;and
hundred and fourscore days,&rdquo; which is 180 days.  Then following that, there
were seven more days, which totaled 187 days for the feast.  </p>

<p>You might have heard the answer to this, but how many times
is the name of God mentioned in the book of Esther?  Zero.  How many times is
the name &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; mentioned in the book of Esther?  Zero.  </p>

<p>I think that it is the only book in the Bible that does not
have the name of God or the name &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; and yet we are going to find, of
course, that it has the Gospel everywhere.  </p>

<p>I was just looking through Esther last night.  The book of
Esther has national Israel.  Then it has a transition to the church age.  Then it
has the end of the church age.  It has the great tribulation.  It has the end
of the great tribulation and the five months.  Then it has post five-month
information.  And it is in sequence.  It is all in order.  </p>

<p>So we are going to find as we go through the book of Esther
that this book does not mention the name of God and the name &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo;  I do not
think that we find the name &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; in the book of Esther.  This is amazing
when we realize that the name Jehovah is found thousands of times in the Old Testament,
yet in Esther this is not found once.  </p>

<p>This is why so many people tend to overlook Esther.  It does
not seem all that important.  It does not even talk about God.  Certainly, some
have felt that if there was any book of the Bible that maybe does not belong
there, it might be a book like this.  Yet we do see the workings of God
throughout this book.  </p>

<p>For example, Esther was taken into the house of the women. 
She was a believer and it was probably a tragic thing for her to be taken into
the house of women, and yet we see how God used this.  </p>

<p>This is just like with Joseph when he was taken as a slave
into Egypt, and yet God worked through circumstances.  Even though things
looked bleak for Esther, it turned into a tremendously wonderful thing that she
was taken into the house of the king&rsquo;s women.  </p>

<p>Then we read later when the king could not sleep and he
called for the book of the records of the chronicles to be read for him, just
by chance.  Then he finds out that Mordecai had warned that two of the king&rsquo;s
doorkeepers were going to plot to kill him, and so he asks, &ldquo;What honour and
dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?&rdquo;  The answer was, &ldquo;There is
nothing done for him.&rdquo;  Just at this time, Haman was in the outer court to come
in in order to talk to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows, but it
so happened at that point that the king wanted to honor Mordecai.  </p>

<p>This was not a coincidence.  This was not an accident.  This
was not luck.  This was the providence of God and the providence of God can be
seen throughout this book.  </p>

<p>180 days breaks down into 2x2x3x3x5 or 4x3x3x5 or 12x3x5.  I
am not sure which one of these we should focus on.  But when we take the 180
days plus the 7 days, this breaks down into 11x17.  This is significant because
11 points to the first coming of Christ after 11,000 years of history.  Of
course, 17 has to do with Heaven and Christ&rsquo;s coming had everything to do with
finally bringing His people to Heaven in order to demonstrate what He had done
before the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>So here the feast is being held.  Then we read in verse six
that it is describing the courtyard or the &ldquo;court of the garden.&rdquo;  We read in
Esther 1:6:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Where were </i>white, green, and blue, <i>hangings, </i>fastened
with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the
beds <i>were of </i>gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and
white, and black, marble.  </p>

<p>I think that it was in the book <i>Time Has an End</i> where
Mr. Camping was referring to an archaeological find in which they found a very
similar court that matches this description in the book of Esther.  This is one
of the reasons why Mr. Camping came up with the year 391 B.C. as the last entry
in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus when they write about the feast of Purim in
chapter nine and it was written in a book.  This was the last entry into the
Old Testament and Mr. Camping has pointed out that this would have been the
year 391 B.C.  </p>

<p>So the book of Esther would cover the first twelve years of
King Ahasuerus, which I think in our calendar would be 404 B.C. to 391 B.C. 
And this is based on archaeological evidence or on secular evidence.  We cannot
prove this from the Bible but this does seem to be accurate and fit.  You may
remember that Mr. Camping did teach that from 391 B.C. to the year 2011 is
7x7x7x7, which is very amazing.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on here in Esther 1:7-9 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they gave <i>them </i>drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the
state of the king. And the drinking <i>was </i>according to the law; none did
compel&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is another thing in the book of Esther, over 2400 years
ago.  There was very much strong emphasis on the rule of law.  Things were done
&ldquo;according to the law&rdquo;; and when the king would speak, it was an unalterable
law.  They could not change the law of the king, even if it was a mistake or a
foolish law.  Maybe we will take a look at a law like this in a little bit. 
Even though King Ahasuerus was probably an unsaved man, he wanted to do things
according to the law of his people.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house,
that they should do according to every man's pleasure. Also Vashti the queen
made a feast for the women <i>in </i>the royal house which <i>belonged </i>to
king Ahasuerus.  </p>

<p>The name of Vashti appears ten times in Esther and nowhere
else in the Bible.  She was the queen.  The king had many wives.  He had a
harem.  He had another house and concubines, but there was only one queen who
would be taken into the royal house where Ahasuerus himself lived.  </p>

<p>Later on when we look at Esther, she is called into one
house and under the rule of the keeper of the women.  There is a certain house
where the eunuch Hege would keep the women.  Then the women would go into the
royal house to spend one night with the king, and then they would be taken back
to the other house and never return unless the king requested them by name. 
King Ahasuerus delighted in Esther and he chose her to be the queen and she moved
out of that house into the royal house where we find Vashti resides.  </p>

<p>So Vashti was not the only wife of Ahasuerus, but she was
the only wife who lived in the royal house.  All of the other wives would have
lived in the house of the women.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Esther 1:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">On the seventh day&hellip;    </p>

<p>This would be the 187<sup>th</sup> day from the feast, 180
plus seven.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded
Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven
chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;chamberlains&rdquo; is also translated as the word
&ldquo;eunuch,&rdquo; and so these men were eunuchs.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,
to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she <i>was </i>fair to look
on.  </p>

<p>Vashti was very beautiful.  Of course, dealing with the king
is why eunuchs would be sent.  This way there would be no possible suggestion
that anything might happen with the queen.  So they went to get Vashti; and the
way that God describes her, she was beautiful.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Lamentations 2, because Vashti is a picture
and a type of national Israel.  This is the main picture that God is using with
her.  We read in Lamentations 2:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">All that pass by clap <i>their </i>hands at thee; they hiss and
wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <i>saying, Is </i>this the city
that <i>men </i>call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?  </p>

<p>In the case of Israel, Jerusalem, or Judah, God looks at
them as being very beautiful.  Zion is spoken of as being beautiful in the
Psalms.  So Vashti was very pretty.  She had a special beauty and she was &ldquo;fair
to look on.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Esther 1:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
by <i>his </i>chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger
burned in him.  </p>

<p>So the queen refuses to come.  On a physical level, we do
not think too much of something like this in our day.  This is the day of
women&rsquo;s liberation and everyone is equal, &ldquo;Who is he to tell me that I have to
go?  I have my own feast that I am taking care of here with the women.  Here he
is on the seventh day when his heart is merry with wine &ndash; in other words, he is
a little tipsy, maybe even drunk &ndash; and he is saying that I have to go and show
up before him.  I know that the king really thinks that I am lovely.  He chose
me out of all of those other women to live in his royal house and to be the
queen.  Certainly, he has a special love for me; and so I think I can get away
with just telling him to forget it.  Forget it; I am busy.  I have to keep my
own feast with the women.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Ahasuerus was angry.  He was a king.  He was a ruler. 
His kingdom depended upon people obeying him.  If people started disobeying the
king who ruled over the kingdom, that would be dangerous and a lot of trouble
for the king.  Actually, this is pointed out later by his seven princes when
they talked about her refusal to come and what should have been done.  They
point out to the king, &ldquo;Look; much wrath will arise as a result of this.  This
will affect all of the husbands.  She has not done wrong only to you, but to
all of the husbands and all of the princes and all of the men of the kingdom. 
They are going to have trouble, too, because their wives are going to say,
&lsquo;Well, Vashti did not go.  Vashti did not come when she was called.  Why do I
have to listen to you?  You are not a king.  You are just an ordinary guy.  Am
I going to listen to you?&rsquo;&rdquo;  We can see that this was a serious matter for them
to handle.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, let us look at some things and then we will get
back to maybe looking at this a little bit more physically.  Let us go to
Nehemiah, which is the book right before Esther.  We read in Nehemiah 9:16-17: 
</p>

<p class="verse">But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, And refused to obey, neither were
mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks,
and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can stop there.  Israel refused to obey God, the King of
kings and the Lord of lords.  </p>

<p>If you are familiar with the Bible, how many verses could
you go to where Israel refuses to obey God?  We could go to many.  We could go
to lots of verses that point this out.  Yet with Vashti, she could have been a
fairly submissive wife.  She probably was in many, many ways.  She was
beautiful and submissive.  She was helping the king.  She was holding the feast
for women.  This was all part of royalty, of entertaining and showing the
grandeur of the enormous kingdom of King Ahasuerus; and yet she offends once.  </p>

<p>It was a little hard of King Ahasuerus to put her away after
only one offence.  But what did God do with one offence from Eve?  With just
one sin, with one refusal to obey God, what did God say?  &ldquo;Of the fruit of the
tree which <i>is </i>in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not
eat of it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>That one seemingly insignificant sin to us today who are
immersed in a sea of sin seems, of course, like nothing to us because we live
and breathe and eat and drink sin all day long.  It is all around us.  What a &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;
her sin is to us.  And yet in a perfect world, in a good world where sin has
never been, we can see how evil a thing it was.  </p>

<p>Well, Vashti is a picture of Israel and she refuses to come,
but the king wants to do things according to the law.  Let us go back to Esther
1:13-15.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
so <i>was </i>the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment: And the
next unto him <i>was </i>Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, <i>and
</i>Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, <i>and
</i>which sat the first in the kingdom;) What shall we do unto the queen Vashti
according to law&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, he did not want to do anything contrary to the law,
&ldquo;According to the law, what can we do?&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?  </p>

<p>This could be one reason why she refused.  It was not the
king himself standing there in his royal robe.  It was seven eunuchs and they
could have easily been despised by someone like the queen.  </p>

<p>Just as God has not come Himself to bring the Gospel to the
world, He sent lowly messengers.  How does the world react to lowly messengers
who carry His message?  We are despised.  No one thinks much of us at all.  </p>

<p>But look at King Ahasuerus&rsquo; reaction, because they were his
ambassadors.  They were his representatives and she refused them.  She refused
seven eunuchs or these chamberlains; but, actually, she refused him.  She
refused him because he had sent them.  </p>

<p>So we read in Esther 1:16-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the
queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to
all the people that <i>are </i>in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. For <i>this
</i>deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall
despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king
Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came
not.<i> Likewise </i>shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all
the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus <i>shall
there arise </i>too much contempt and wrath.  </p>

<p>This was very important to the whole kingdom and to the
whole peace of the kingdom.  But some people might say, &ldquo;Look; this is ancient
history.  This was over 2400 years ago.  Of course, they were not a modern
society.  They did not have modern understanding like we do today.  We are so
much more knowledgeable today.  We really know how to live today.  We really
know how to do things much better than they did in ancient times.  Just look at
our society.  Just look at our civilization.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, nobody ever says this, of course.  Just look at the
daily newspaper.  Does that really prove that we are really wise?  Does it
really show when we watch the news that we know better than God?  We know how
the house should be run.  We know that it should be a matter of equality, this
whole idea of a husband ruling in his own home and of parents ruling their
children.  Is the wife really to be in submission to the husband?  That is
really antiquated.  That is just foolish.  </p>

<p>Yet where is the evidence that the world&rsquo;s idea of how the
house runs works?  Is it in the 50% divorce rate?  Is it in just the way that
the whole society is operating?  There is no evidence that their ideas have any
merit at all.  This was over 2400 years ago, so let us go to something more
recent like something that was a little over 1900 years ago.  </p>

<p>Let us go to 1 Timothy 2 where we will see that God&rsquo;s wisdom
concerning this does not change.  It says in 1 Timothy 2:11-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer
not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but
the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  </p>

<p>This has to do primarily with teaching and spiritual things,
but this is showing that God has a hierarchy.  He has those who should teach. 
We see this in other places also in the Bible.  Here it says that it is the
man.  The man should teach.  The woman should not.  And He refers back to Eve
being deceived and not Adam, because the serpent went to Eve first.  She was
the one who fell into sin.  Then Adam ate and he also sinned.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Ephesians 5:22-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of
the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is
subject unto Christ, so <i>let </i>the wives <i>be </i>to their own husbands in
every thing.  </p>

<p>Here, this is talking about an actual marriage, a marriage
of today.  This is instruction for all marriages, for anybody who wants to
become man and wife.  God gives later admonition to the husbands, &ldquo;Husbands,
love your wives.&rdquo;  And He says to the wife, &ldquo;Wives, submit yourselves unto your
own husbands.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The reason for this is because spiritually this is a
picture.  It is a figure.  It is a type of Christ and His Bride, the eternal
Church, those whom He has saved.  So in order to properly demonstrate this, the
wife should listen to her husband.  The husband, of course, should not be a
tyrant and he should not command his wife like a king, &ldquo;Bring me this.  Do
this.  Do that.&rdquo;  It should not be this way because God tempers this with the
command to the husband, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Things should not be that way, but what if a woman ends up
with a tyrant for a husband?  Well, that is a severe test.  She can pray for
wisdom and help.  Over in 1 Peter 3, notice what God says in that kind of
case.  We read in 1 Peter 3:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Likewise, ye wives, <i>be </i>in subjection to your own
husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won
by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation <i>coupled
</i>with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward <i>adorning </i>of
plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But <i>let
it be </i>the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, <i>even
the ornament </i>of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of
great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own
husbands: Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye
are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  </p>

<p>So here God indicates that someone might have a tough time
at home and their husband maybe is not loving or kind or gentle.  But still,
they could win him possibly &ndash; and this was true all through history &ndash; if she
has a good conversation (conduct), if she keeps praying for him, and if this is
God&rsquo;s will.  If it is the Lord&rsquo;s will and he is one of His elect, that would be
the way to do it.  </p>

<p>So here is Vashti and she thinks that she has her reasons. 
She thinks that she would not just refuse to come if there were not good
reasons.  But God gives us commandments.  He always gives us commandments. Is
there ever a sufficient reason to disobey Him?  We may think that we have
reason to disobey Him, but there is really never justification for disobeying
God.  Disobeying God is just another way of saying that we are sinning or that
we are transgressing His Law, and we never have justification for doing this.  </p>

<p>It goes on here in Esther 1:19 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that
it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the
king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.  </p>

<p>So here is Vashti.  After consulting with his seven princes,
it is determined, &ldquo;Let us put her away.&rdquo;  She will leave the royal house. 
Maybe she would go back to a place in the house of the women.  But never again
will King Ahasuerus and Vashti meet.  She is going to be put out of his sight. 
She will no longer be the queen.  She is put away.  </p>

<p>Of course, we can see how God did this with Israel.  When
Jesus went to the cross and the veil of the temple was rent in twain, He
divorced national Israel.  He put Israel away.  When was this?  It was after
11,000 years that He was born and entered into the human race and then went to
the cross.  </p>

<p>So like 187 days of this feast, the focus is on the number
11.  After 187 days, Vashti is put away.  Notice this statement:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better
than she.  </p>

<p>Take a look at Matthew 21.  It would be good to read this
whole parable, but we are only going to look at one verse.  We read in Matthew
21:43:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.  </p>

<p>This is Israel.  If you read this parable, this is
especially obvious.  &ldquo;Given to a nation&rdquo; would be referring to the New
Testament period when God began using churches and congregations to evangelize
the world.  </p>

<p>So here Vashti is put away and then a search will begin for
a replacement.  It says in Esther 1:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall
give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.  </p>

<p>Of course, spiritually, God could not continue to put up
with Israel&rsquo;s disobedience and their rebelliousness.  This whole thing on an
earthly level with the king is true on a spiritual level.  Men can tend to
think that they can do anything that they want towards the Law of God.  Look at
  Israel or look at the church.  Look at how the church responds to the Law of
God.  </p>

<p>This is why God put away Israel and this is also why He
judged the churches and congregations at the end of the church age.  It was for
the same reason.  They were rebellious.  They refused to keep His laws.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Esther 1:21-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
did according to the word of Memucan: For he sent letters into all the king's
provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every
people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house,
and that <i>it </i>should be published according to the language of every
people.  </p>

<p>It is just amazing when you look at the book of Esther and
you see its international scope.  It is really worldwide.  Of course, it is 127
provinces from India to Ethiopia, so this meant that there were parts of Africa
that were not part of the kingdom beyond India.  China, Korea, and Japan were
not part of the kingdom.  The Americas were not part of this kingdom.  But it
was the greatest kingdom of that day and it typifies the world where all the Jews
were found in those 127 provinces.  Remember also Sarah&rsquo;s death age.  This is
where the elect are.  They are out in the 127 provinces or out in the world.  </p>

<p>So when the king makes a decree in Shushan, they publish
it.  They do not just publish it in Shushan and in the surrounding provinces. 
They publish it in all 127 provinces.  Everyone is kept informed.  It is like a
worldwide notification that this is what happened with the king and with his
wife.  She was put away and another is going to be chosen.  Then the
commandment is that every man shall bear rule in his own house.  </p>

<p>When God put away Israel and began sending the Gospel into
the world, this was really underlying a truth that was a part of this, which is
that God is bearing rule in His own house.  He put away this rebellious woman
and He is now notifying all the world that you can now be what?  They can now
be His Bride.  </p>

<p>This is because the king put away Vashti.  In other words, Israel
was put away and the Gospel went into all the world to call people like
virgins.  Are there not ten virgins in Matthew 25, five foolish and five wise? 
The 144,000 virgins in Revelation 14 typify all those whom God saved during the
church age.  They were all likened to virgins.  This is because when God saves
someone, He washes them and cleanses them and makes them pure and innocent, and
so a virgin typifies this.  </p>

<p>Let us just read the first four verses in chapter two.  Then
we are going to have to stop.  It says in Esther 2:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed
against her. Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there
be fair young virgins sought for the king: And let the king appoint officers in
all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair
young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the
custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their
things for purification be given <i>them:</i> And let the maiden which pleaseth
the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did
so.  </p>

<p>Read these verses in consideration of the Gospel going out
now, because Israel has been put away.  So this would be from the first century
A.D. on and through the church age.  </p>

<p>Let us just read one other verse.  We read in Esther 2:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he brought up Hadassah, that <i>is, </i>Esther&hellip;   </p>

<p>Hadassah is Esther.  Hadassah would probably be her Hebrew
name and Esther would be a name that she would have taken on because she was in
a foreign land.  </p>

<p>If anyone is interested in studying this during this next
week, Hadassah is found in Zechariah 1.  In Zechariah 1:7-11, Hadassah is found
three times as &ldquo;the myrtle trees.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Myrtle tree&rdquo; is the word for &ldquo;Hadassah.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is significant.  This is because in Zechariah 1, we
have post-May 21 information.  Zechariah 1:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the end of the five-month period, which we will take
a look at next time.  Then we read of Hadassah three times.  </p>

<p>This reminds us of the three times that we read in John 21,
&ldquo;Lovest thou me?&rdquo;  Jesus asked this of Peter three times.  </p>

<p>So this is indicating God&rsquo;s purpose.  Esther&rsquo;s name is also
Hadassah.  This is giving us information about what comes after May 21.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Heavenly Father, we do thank You for Your grace.  We
thank You for Your Word.  We pray that each of us might be given Your Spirit to
be obedient and to obey You more and more.  May we not be like a disobedient
wife.  May You grant us grace to do Your will and to keep Your commandments. 
We pray this in Christ&rsquo;s Name.  Amen.  </i></p>
