  A continued look into Esther chapter 7. 
  Esther 7:7 points to Judgment day taking place on the 17th day of the 2nd month which relates to May 21 2011. 
  The king arising in his wrath and going to the palace garden reminds us that the trouble with Satan began in the garden of Eden. 
  The word banquet is translated as &ldquo;feast&rdquo; in certain verses and it is also translated as &ldquo;drink&rdquo; in Daniel. 
  Also, &ldquo;drinking the wine&rdquo; is related to drinking the cup of God's wrath.
