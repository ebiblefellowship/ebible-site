<p>Let us read a passage in Deuteronomy 16.  We read in
Deuteronomy 16:1-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto JEHOVAH
thy God: for in the month of Abib JEHOVAH thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt
by night. Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto JEHOVAH thy God, of
the flock and the herd, in the place which JEHOVAH shall choose to place his
name there. Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat
unleavened bread therewith, <i>even </i>the bread of affliction: for thou
camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the
day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. And
there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days;
neither shall there <i>any thing </i>of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the
first day at even, remain all night until the morning. Thou mayest not
sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which JEHOVAH thy God giveth
thee: But at the place which JEHOVAH thy God shall choose to place his name in,
there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun,
at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. And thou shalt roast and eat
<i>it </i>in the place which JEHOVAH thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn
in the morning, and go unto thy tents. Six days thou shalt eat unleavened
bread: and on the seventh day <i>shall be </i>a solemn assembly to JEHOVAH thy
God: thou shalt do no work <i>therein.</i> Seven weeks shalt thou number unto
thee: begin to number the seven weeks from <i>such time as </i>thou beginnest <i>to
put </i>the sickle to the corn. And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto
JEHOVAH thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou
shalt give <i>unto the LORD thy God, </i>according as JEHOVAH thy God hath
blessed thee: And thou shalt rejoice before JEHOVAH thy God, thou, and thy son,
and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that <i>is
</i>within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
<i>are </i>among you, in the place which JEHOVAH thy God hath chosen to place
his name there. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
thou shalt observe and do these statutes. Thou shalt observe the feast of
tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:
And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and
thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the
fatherless, and the widow, that <i>are </i>within thy gates. Seven days shalt
thou keep a solemn feast unto JEHOVAH thy God in the place which JEHOVAH shall
choose: because JEHOVAH thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in
all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>I just want to mention that last week I said that the Feast
of Tabernacles was identified with the latter rain period from September 1994
through May 21 of 2011.  Someone pointed out this verse that I have gone to
myself to indicate that the fruit is gathered in first and then the Feast of
Tabernacles is held afterwards, because it says in Deuteronomy 16:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:  </p>

<p>I just want to explain something and to thank the person who
brought this up.  This is somewhat of a correction, but it also helped me to
understand a little bit more of what God has done.  </p>

<p>Remember that the Feast of Tabernacles is identified with
the Feast of Ingathering, and it was the Feast of Ingathering, really, that was
in view beginning September 7, 1994 when the latter rain began to be poured out
and the great multitude began to be saved.  That Feast of Ingathering continued
for over that period that was about 17 years.  </p>

<p>In this sense, Tabernacles is identified with the 17 years
of the latter rain, because Ingathering was to be held at the same time as the
Feast of Tabernacles.  Yet the fruit has to be gathered in before you hold the
Feast of Tabernacles.  </p>

<p>For now, I do not want to get into how I think that this has
worked out, but I did just want to thank the person for bringing this up.  It
is probably more accurate to think of the 17-year period from 1994 to 2011 as
the spiritual fulfillment of the Feast of Ingathering, which is identified with
Tabernacles.  </p>

<p>By the way, this is not the study for today.  I am just
making a comment on the Scripture that we read.  But in Nehemiah 8, which is
the one place in the Old Testament where the phrase &ldquo;last day&rdquo; is mentioned and
is the phrase that we find seven times in the New Testament where Jesus in the
Gospel of John said, &ldquo;I will raise <span class="underline">him</span> up at the last day,&rdquo; this does
not say &ldquo;them.&rdquo;  It says, &ldquo;I will raise <span class="underline">him</span> up at the last day&rdquo;; and in
Nehemiah 8:18, referring to the last day of the feast, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is referring to the last day of the Feast of
Tabernacles and this is why we thought that the raising &ldquo;him&rdquo; up meant the
believers that would be raised up and resurrected on the last day of the Feast
of Tabernacles.  </p>

<p>Well, in the context of Nehemiah 8, notice what it says in
Nehemiah 8:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both
of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first
day of the seventh month.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The first day of the seventh month&rdquo; was September 7<sup>th</sup>
in 1994 and it was the day of the blowing of trumpets.  This is where Nehemiah
8 begins and then they have a reading of the Scripture where they had 13 men
who caused the reading of the Scripture to be understood.  It was a huge
congregation and they did not have microphones.  Ezra was on the podium where
he would preach, and then they had 13 men who would explain what was being
said.  </p>

<p>This fits in with the whole period of the latter rain when
God opened the Scriptures after 13,000 years of history and caused His people
to understand many things, which leads right into the Feast of Tabernacles and
that reference to the &ldquo;last day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So the Feast of Ingathering all began on the &ldquo;first day of
the seventh month.&rdquo;  Spiritually, it was fulfilled over the 17-year period. 
This is how it is identified with Tabernacles, which, if you remember, Mr.
Camping called &ldquo;the feast of the Bible.&rdquo;  This was because of the way that God
identifies this, especially here in Nehemiah, with the opening up of the
Scriptures, which identifies with the years that were just past.  </p>

<p>Let us read another passage in the New Testament in the book
of James.  We will read chapter one.  It says in James 1:1-27:  </p>

<p class="verse">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count it all
joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing <i>this, </i>that the trying
of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have <i>her </i>perfect work,
that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i>men </i>liberally, and upbraideth
not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For
he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For
let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double
minded man <i>is </i>unstable in all his ways. Let the brother of low degree
rejoice in that he is exalted: But the rich, in that he is made low: because as
the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with
a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and
the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away
in his ways. Blessed <i>is </i>the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
that love him. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: But every man is
tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust
hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth
forth death. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect
gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the
word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. Wherefore,
my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to
wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Wherefore lay
apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness
the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the
word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer
of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face
in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of
liberty, and continueth <i>therein, </i>he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. If any man among you
seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart,
this man's religion <i>is </i>vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and
the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <i>and
</i>to keep himself unspotted from the world.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>There is just one comment that I would like to make on
this.  In James 1:3, we read again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Knowing <i>this, </i>that the trying of your faith worketh
patience.  </p>

<p>So we could define &ldquo;patience&rdquo; as &ldquo;the trying of your
faith.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is interesting what we read in Hebrews 10:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise.  </p>

<p>So you do &ldquo;the will of God,&rdquo; and we will not discuss at this
time how it was possible to have done this when we know that this is an ongoing
thing on a daily basis; but God says &ldquo;after ye have done the will of God&rdquo; that
&ldquo;ye have need of patience.&rdquo;  What is &ldquo;patience&rdquo;?  It is &ldquo;the trying of your
faith&rdquo; so that &ldquo;ye might receive the promise.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When we think about patience and we think about waiting, we
just think that it is a period of time.  This is our understanding and idea of
this.  But, actually, patience is a period of trial.  </p>

<p>Just think about this.  During a period of trial, if you
fail the trial, have you patiently waited?  No.  You have not exhibited any
patience at all, so you are not being patient and you are not waiting
properly.  </p>

<p>True patience is when you are being tried &ldquo;after ye have
done the will of God&rdquo; and it is the trial &ldquo;of your faith&rdquo; so that it can be
seen.  Then after that period, God will give the promise.  He will give what
the Bible speaks of.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have a short passage or verse?  Okay.  We are
right there.  We read in Hebrews 10:26-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the
adversaries. He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three
witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood
of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite
unto the Spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance <i>belongeth
</i>unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge
his people.<i> It is </i>a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God. But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; Partly, whilst ye were
made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye
became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my
bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that
ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Cast not away therefore
your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience,
that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet
a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the
just shall live by faith: but if <i>any man </i>draw back, my soul shall have
no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
them that believe to the saving of the soul.</p>

<p>God will not tarry, which means that He has a set time or a
set date that has never changed and never will change.  It was known from the
very beginning.  He knows the end from the beginning, and that date is set in
stone.  It is unalterable.  It is the end of the world.  </p>

<p>Then why does God say in Habakkuk: &ldquo;though it [<i>he</i>]
tarry&rdquo;?  Remember that we need to change that pronoun from &ldquo;it&rdquo; to &ldquo;he.&rdquo;  So why
does He say, &ldquo;Though [<i>he</i>] tarry&hellip;[<i>he</i>] will not tarry&rdquo;?  Do you
remember this?  </p>

<p>So, on one hand, He is saying that He is going to tarry.  On
the other hand, He is saying that He will not tarry, which, of course, is the
case because God knows that He set up a program wherein it would give every
appearance in the world that there would be a certain date that would be the
end of the world and that this date would come and go.  </p>

<p>So, from the vantage point of man with our limited
understanding, it appears that He tarried.  But, in fact, He has not tarried. 
He has a time, an appointed time, when He will return.  </p>

<p>[Note: A question is asked about our need of patience and if
this is in relation to the period of time when it appears that He is tarrying
and when the final end comes.]  </p>

<p>Yes.  The key phrase is &ldquo;after ye have done the will of
God.&rdquo;  It was God&rsquo;s will to warn the world of Judgment Day on May 21, 2011.  This is done and it is a finished act.  But now we need patience, which is
actually the trying of faith, because this is all included in God&rsquo;s plan, until
the actual time that has been selected by Him comes.  </p>

<p>I think that we will discuss this date in a few weeks.  We
are not going to discuss this today because we are not ready.  </p>
