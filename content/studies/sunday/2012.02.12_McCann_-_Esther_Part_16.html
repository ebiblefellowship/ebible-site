<p>We are just going to do a shortened study in Esther.  Then I
would like to discuss the doubling of the five months one more time.  </p>

<p>The problem is that there are at least three different ways
of doing this and I keep wondering which way is best, and so I am just going to
lay out all three.  We will see that this is what God has done; but depending
on how this is done, the numbers can be looked at in a different way.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Esther 7.  We saw in Esther 7:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath <i>went
</i>into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to
Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the
king. Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the
banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther <i>was. </i>Then
said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word
went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.  </p>

<p>So we were looking at Revelation 2:22 that is speaking of
the churches and states:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great tribulation&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what has just happened.  Over the 23-year judgment
on the congregations, God cast them into a bed of spiritual fornication and it
was great tribulation.  Satan was very much involved with this.  </p>

<p>We have to again remember that the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month was May 21 and that May 21 was the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day of the great tribulation.  Simultaneously, it was also the 6100<sup>th</sup>
day of the latter rain.  It was also the first day of the Day of Judgment.  </p>

<p>How God did all of this can be a little mysterious.  This is
because with the latter rain, He was saving.  Then May 21, or the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, began on the Friday evening of May 20<sup>th</sup>. 
From Friday evening, May 20<sup>th</sup>, till sundown of Saturday, May 21<sup>st</sup>,
was the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>On that day, God closed the whole great tribulation period. 
He could not bring judgment until He closed the judgment on the church, because
the Bible tells us that judgment &ldquo;must begin at the house of God&rdquo;; and so He
had to first close the judgment on the churches and congregations.  Then, also,
there was the latter rain.  </p>

<p>I do not know if you have thought about this, but since the
17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month began on Friday evening and
went into Saturday until sundown, it could be that God was saving on that
Saturday, on May 21<sup>st</sup> itself.  </p>

<p>I know that I was just looking towards midnight of that Friday and thinking that that was all the time that we had, but we do have precedent
for God saving on May 21<sup>st</sup> in the flood account.  What I mean by
this is that He gives precedent for saving individuals or at least giving a
figure of salvation on the same day that He brings judgment.  </p>

<p>This is because of what we read in Genesis 7:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was
upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the selfsame day entered Noah,
and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the
three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;  </p>

<p>What day did they enter in?  They entered in on 2/17.  The
ark typifies Christ and their entry into the ark points to salvation.  This
happened the same day that the flood waters came.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what we see when we lay out the 8400 days. 
When we go from the first day of the great tribulation and we lay this all out,
day 8400 comes to the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, or May
21, and so does day 6100.  </p>

<p>Remember that there was the first part of the great
tribulation, the first 2300 evening/mornings, when virtually no one was being
saved.  Then the latter rain began for 6100 days, but day 6100 did not end
until the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month ended.  </p>

<p>Somehow, God closed the great tribulation, He finished
saving everyone who was part of the great multitude whom He intended to save,
and then He brought judgment all on the same day.  </p>

<p>So the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month is
also day one of the first five-month period.  We say it was day one, but was
this a full 24-hour span of the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month?  No; because on some portion of that day, God was still saving.  More
than likely, God was still saving most of that day and He stayed the judgment until
near the end of that day, and so the judgment aspect of that day could have
been going on for only a couple of hours.  </p>

<p>We will talk about this later, but if we are counting day one,
that may actually be an overlap of 2/17 / 2/18 on the Hebrew calendar before we
get to one full day.  We will look at this at the end of discussing these
things when we lay out the three different ways that God doubled the five
months at this time.  </p>

<p>But in Esther 7 when Haman was fallen upon the bed, this was
representing day 8400 of the great tribulation.  Haman was a type of Satan, and
Satan has been very successful in alluring and manipulating the church into
spiritual fornication and into an adulterous relationship with him.  Now as
soon as the king steps out, Haman is on Esther&rsquo;s bed; and this is the spiritual
picture.  The spiritual picture, basically, is that Satan is trying to actually
deceive the elect, like he was able to deceive the churches into rebellion
against God.  </p>

<p>Let us look at it in this way.  In 2 Kings, we read of King
Hezekiah (of Judah) and the Assyrian army.  This army came against Jerusalem.  Rabshakeh,
the Assyrian king&rsquo;s representative, said in 2 Kings 18:25:   </p>

<p class="verse">Am I now come up without JEHOVAH against this place to destroy
it? JEHOVAH said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.  </p>

<p>This was what they were claiming.  The Assyrians were
claiming that God had given Jerusalem and Judah into their hands.  This claim
had some weight behind it because practically all of the nations had been given
up into the hands of the Assyrians at that time.  This would have included Samaria,
which was Israel in the north.  The Assyrians were the ones who destroyed them;
and who was the God of Samaria or who was the God of Israel?  It was Jehovah.  </p>

<p>Then it says in 2 Kings 18:33-34:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where <i>are </i>the gods of Hamath,
and of Arpad? where <i>are </i>the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have
they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?  </p>

<p>He saved Samaria for last because he understood that the
Jews did not think anything of these other nations and their gods; they were
idols.  But Samaria had Jehovah, the same God as Judah.  </p>

<p>So the claim was that God gave up Israel in the north, the
ten tribes, and the charge was that He was giving the Jews in Jerusalem up,
too.  What was being said to the Jews in Jerusalem was that the same God who
gave up Samaria was giving them up.  </p>

<p>This is a spiritual picture.  The king of Assyria is a type
of Satan.  Hezekiah is a picture of Christ.  And it is true.  God gave up the
corporate body.  He gave up the professed Christians &ndash; those who only say that
they are Christians &ndash; over into the hands of the enemy, over into the hands of
Satan himself.  </p>

<p>The king of Assyria is really representative here of Satan
and his pride.  In his arrogance, he has destroyed the corporate church, which Samaria
is picturing.  Now he has gone after the actual elect people of God, who are
here being pictured as those who are inside Jerusalem with King Hezekiah within
the city.  </p>

<p>That is what Satan has done.  He thinks that because God has
given up the church that he can also go after the elect people of God and
destroy them in the same way that he destroyed the church.  I think that this
is what is in view when Haman is fallen on the bed in Esther 7, but then the
king returns because God will not allow this to happen.  </p>

<p>Who knows what would have happened if King Ahasuerus had
spent any length of time out in the garden.  But the king went out quickly, he
got the guards or the soldiers, then he came back in and they seized Haman.  </p>

<p>Then the king says in Esther 7:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Will he force the queen also before me in the house?&hellip; </p>

<p>Then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's
face.  </p>

<p>This was a picture of God protecting His people who are
being typified by Esther.  Satan tries and tries, up until the very last, to
come against the chosen people of salvation, those who were predestinated from
before the foundation of the world, but he just cannot pull it off.  As it says
in Matthew 24, he can develop gospels to the point where &ldquo;if <i>it were </i>possible,
they shall deceive the very elect&rdquo;; but this is not possible, because God keeps
watch over His people.  </p>

<p>God protects His people and, finally, Satan cannot do the
same thing with the elect that he has been able to do with those who just carry
the name of Christ like a title.  They do not have Christ in their hearts; they
just carry the name of Christian.  They are professed believers, but they are not
actual believers.  God also gave them up into Satan&rsquo;s hands, but there was a
limit.  Satan could only go so far and he could not go beyond the boundary of Jerusalem,
which is the Jerusalem above, the city where each and every elect is found.  </p>

<p>So we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they covered Haman's face.   </p>

<p>But I do not know exactly what this means.  I cannot find
anywhere else where it says that someone&rsquo;s face was covered by someone.  </p>

<p>In Jeremiah 14:3-4, we do find:  </p>

<p class="verse">And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they
came to the pits, <i>and </i>found no water; they returned with their vessels
empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. Because the
ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed,
they covered their heads.  </p>

<p>This is the same word for &ldquo;covered&rdquo;; and, of course, if you
completely cover your head, you have covered your face, but this does not
necessarily mean that.  This could just be referring to some sort of cover on
the top of their heads.  </p>

<p>This does, however, seem to have something to do with
shame.  Here, they are covering Haman&rsquo;s face.  It is time for his judgment, and
shame has everything to do with the judgment of God.  </p>

<p>If you remember, Mr. Camping did a study that showed that
shame was an integral part of the judgment process and that God would shame
those who are under His wrath.  It is the same thing for Satan.  </p>

<p>Actually, this was a big day of shame for Haman.  When Haman
had to take Mordecai around on horseback, there was a lot of shame involved in
that.  Remember that Haman had thought that Esther had wanted him at the
banquet of wine because he was such a high-level official, when it actually
turned out that Esther indicated that Haman was the one who was trying to kill
her and her people; and so there was a lot of shame involved in Haman&rsquo;s
judgment on that day.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Esther 7:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king&hellip;   </p>

<p>Harbonah is only mentioned one other time back in Esther
1:10.  He was one of the seven chamberlains who had gone to get Vashti.  It
says in Esther 1:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and
Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the
king,  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;chamberlain&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;eunuch.&rdquo;  Here
we read of seven eunuchs, which is why they were sent to get the queen.  This
was a safe thing to do.  They went to get Vashti when the king called for her,
and this was when Vashti refused to come.  </p>

<p>That was the last mention of Harbona until here in Esther 7,
and Harbona was one of the more trusted eunuchs.  So Esther 7:9 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
Behold also, the <span class="underline">gallows</span> fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for
Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.
Then the king said, Hang him thereon.  </p>

<p>So Harbonah remembered that Mordecai had &ldquo;spoken good for
the king.&rdquo;  This was a few years earlier in Esther 2 when Mordecai learned that
the two doorkeepers were going to do something to the king as they were
plotting against him.  </p>

<p>It says in Esther 2:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told <i>it </i>unto
Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king <i>thereof </i>in Mordecai's
name.  </p>

<p>Harbona remembered this.  I can actually guess that this was
no wonder; because that night leading into the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, one of the chamberlains was reading the chronicles to the king and that
event was pointed out.   That was why the king asked who was in the outer
court.  Haman was called in and then they exalted Mordecai.  </p>

<p>So what Mordecai had done was probably still fresh in a lot
of people&rsquo;s minds; and, here, Harbona also knows that Haman had built a
gallows.  The word &ldquo;gallows&rdquo; is a word that is just a normal word for &ldquo;tree&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wood.&rdquo;  It is the very same word.  It could say that he built a wood.  What he
did was build a place to hang Mordecai that was made out of wood and they called
it &ldquo;gallows.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This term has stayed around for hundreds of years.  In
certain nations, you will find references to someone being hanged on a gallows,
and this comes out of the Bible.  </p>

<p>If we go to Deuteronomy 21, we will find this same word for
&ldquo;gallows&rdquo; translated as &ldquo;tree&rdquo; a couple of times.  We read in Deuteronomy
21:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to
be put to death, and thou hang him on a <span class="underline">tree</span>:</p>

<p>This is the same word.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">His body shall not remain all night upon the <span class="underline">tree</span>, but
thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged <i>is </i>accursed
of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which JEHOVAH thy God giveth thee <i>for
</i>an inheritance.  </p>

<p>Here God is laying down a law, a very important law, that if
you are hanged on a tree, this means that you are &ldquo;accursed of God&rdquo;; and anyone
who is hanged on a tree, such as a cross made of wood or made of a tree, they
are cursed.  </p>

<p>Galatians 3 points this out, as God makes reference back to
these verses in Deuteronomy.  We read in Galatians 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
curse for us: for it is written, Cursed <i>is </i>every one that hangeth on a
tree:  </p>

<p>This was why Jesus was hanged on a cross.  It was because
that was a symbol.  It was picturing that He had the sins of His people upon
Him.  For their sake, He became accursed.  If you break the law, you are
cursed; and Jesus became accursed for us in order that we could receive the
blessing.  </p>

<p>It is either blessing or cursing; it is one or the other. 
The Bible tells us that there are blessings for obedience and that there are
curses for disobedience.  All mankind is disobedient; therefore, we are all
under the curse.  The only way to become blessed is if Christ takes that penalty
and then God gives us a new heart.  </p>

<p>In that new heart, what do we desire to do?  We desire to
obey.  We desire to keep God&rsquo;s commandments and to do the will of God.  This is
why we are blessed, &ldquo;Blessed <i>are </i>the poor in spirit,&rdquo; because they have
been given a new broken, contrite heart that is in perfect submission to the
will of God, to the Bible.  Therefore, they are blessed and not cursed.  </p>

<p>So all of this is in view as we are looking in the book of
Esther and we are finding that Haman built a gallows and that he wanted to hang
Christ on that gallows or on that tree.  He wanted to hang Mordecai, did he
not?  And he wanted to do it on the very day of the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the
2<sup>nd</sup> month!  This was what his intent was when he was going in to see
the king early in the morning to make request to the king to hang Mordecai on
that same day that he had the gallows built.  </p>

<p>This makes us wonder some things, because Christ has already
been hanged.  He has already been made accursed.  Did Satan want to do this
again?  Did he really want to crucify Christ afresh on that particular day?  </p>

<p>We talked about how this would have worked a little bit
before.  The way that this would have worked is that if he were successful, if
he could have prevented the Gospel from reaching one of God&rsquo;s great multitude
who were scattered all over the earth, if he could have prevented this from
reaching their ears and from them believing it &ndash; after all, Satan had hundreds
of millions of professing Christians out there saying that no man knows the day
or hour and trying to just bring doubt about the whole thing at every point &ndash;
if he could somehow have caused even one of those whom God had died for from
before the foundation of the world from receiving the application of that or
from being redeemed prior to the time that God intended to shut the door on May
21, then what would have happened?  Satan would have been successful, because
God would then have had an insurmountable problem.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s plan called for Him to have this day of salvation, but
only to a certain point.  He actually told the whole world this as May 21, the
17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, was proclaimed, which
identified with the day that was 7,000 years earlier when He shut Noah into the
ark and Noah and his family were safe and secure.  </p>

<p>If Satan could have made it through that day where somewhere
some elect person in China or in India or in Africa or in America, just one elect
individual, if he could keep the Gospel away from them, then that person would
not have had the salvation of Christ applied to them.  They would not have been
redeemed.  </p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, it would be like Christ would
have to go and die for that person again.  God would have to take that person&rsquo;s
sins upon Himself again and work out a whole other salvation plan, which would
require Jesus to be crucified again.  This was Satan&rsquo;s hope.  </p>

<p>Of course, it was just ridiculous to think that God would
not be successful in doing this.  And what do we find?  We find that all over
the earth, for the first time in history leading up to May 21, I do not know of
anyone who did not hear about this.  </p>

<p>We were talking about this during the break.  Even if
someone says that they did not hear about May 21, it could have been two or
three years earlier that they received a tract and threw it in the trash and
just forgot about it.  </p>

<p>Everyone heard &ldquo;Judgment Day!&rdquo;  But they did not hear, &ldquo;God
loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.&rdquo;  They did not hear a message
from the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses who are scattered here and there.  They heard a
very definite warning from the Bible &ndash; Judgment Day!  It was right there in
their faces and they could not get away from it.  It was on billboards, tracts,
T-shirts, hats, vehicles, TV.  It they turned on the news, it was on the news. 
It was seemingly everywhere for the first time in history in every land and in
every nation.  </p>

<p>Why?  How could this be if this was due to a cult?  See if
any cult can do this who has another kind of a gospel.  Any other gospel is
free to try this.  Go ahead.  Make the attempt.  And they have been attempting
this.  They try to share their gospel, but it only has inroads here and there
because God is not working with them.  He is not with them and He is not
helping them.  He did not open up doors for them.  But for this message, He
opened up &ldquo;a great door and effectual.&rdquo;  There were &ldquo;many adversaries,&rdquo; but He
still opened up a great and effectual door that no man was able to shut at that
point.  God Himself shut this door and He shut it on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  When He shut it, every last one of His elect had
heard and God had saved them.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what we find here in Esther when Esther is
going to make her request on this very day to the king.  She is praying for
herself and for all of the Jews in all of the provinces of the whole kingdom. 
Nobody is left out.  </p>

<p>A little later, we will see again how everyone was saved by
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  This had to work itself
out until the day of Purim actually comes.  But basically on this day, all of
the Jews in all of the provinces are delivered by what takes place at this
particular time.  </p>

<p>So the gallows were 50 cubits high and the number 50 breaks
down to 5x10.  The number 5 is the number for atonement.  The sword of God&rsquo;s
Gospel cuts both ways: grace and judgment.  In this case in regards to Satan,
there was no grace.  God never made provision for Satan or for the fallen
angels.  He never provided any salvation for them.  It cuts to judgment only;
and the number 10 points to the completeness of that judgment.  After 13,000
years of history, it was time.  This began way back in the Garden of Eden, and
now it was to the point where Satan was to be judged.  </p>

<p>Even the word &ldquo;high&rdquo; (the gallows fifty cubits high) is
translated as &ldquo;proud,&rdquo; &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; and &ldquo;haughty&rdquo; in a few instances.  It is also
translated as &ldquo;high&rdquo;; but was this not like Haman who was a very proud man?  He
could not just build a gallows.  He had to practically build a skyscraper.  He
had to make it 75 feet high, because he wanted Mordecai to hang where everyone
could see him.  But it turns out that it was all turned on him.  Whenever
anyone tries to curse God&rsquo;s people, this does not turn out good for them
because God never allows this.  </p>

<p>So, here, in his pride, Haman builds this gallows, and yet
he is the one who ends up being placed upon it.  Then it goes on to say in
Esther 7:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the
king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.  </p>

<p>It is now Haman who is being accursed.  He is the one who is
accursed.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Esther 7:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath <span class="underline">pacified</span>.  </p>

<p>You can find this same Hebrew word for &ldquo;pacified&rdquo; back in
Genesis 8 where it is translated as a different English word.  It says in
Genesis 8:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
cattle that <i>was </i>with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over
the earth, and the waters <span class="underline">asswaged</span>;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The waters were asswaged&rdquo; or &ldquo;pacified.&rdquo;  The idea is that
those waters prevailed for 150 days.  Judgment Day came on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month and the waters prevailed.  Then they were
pacified.  </p>

<p>If we did not understand the doubling of the five months, we
would not understand how the waters could be pacified after five months and yet
we are still here going on 9 months and into 10 months.  But the answer is that
God doubled this; and so what was true of five months is true of ten months. 
The waters will be prevailing until the end of the double five-month period. 
Then God&rsquo;s wrath will be pacified.  </p>

<p>But how does this help us with Haman, because it is on the
first Day of Judgment that he is hanged?  He is hanged on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>God cannot just spell everything out.  Remember that this is
Judgment Day, but this Day extends for months.  Haman, representing Satan, is
accursed from day one, but have you ever thought about his ten sons?  His ten
sons identify with the beast and the ten horns, and the ten sons are also
hanged during the feast of Purim.   </p>

<p>We see this in Esther 9:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
the Jews which <i>are </i>in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.  </p>

<p>Actually, they were hanged after they were already dead,
because they had been killed on the first day, Adar 13, and this is the 2<sup>nd</sup>
day, Adar 14.  So they took there dead bodies and they hanged them.  </p>

<p>This is because the beast and the ten horns are one.  If you
look at Revelation 13, it is all speaking of the same being.  Satan has many
names in the Bible.  He is &ldquo;the beast,&rdquo; &ldquo;the devil,&rdquo; &ldquo;the dragon,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
serpent,&rdquo; etc.  Also, God is spiritually identifying Satan as Haman here, which
is pointing to the beast; and his ten sons are also representing Satan.  </p>

<p>This is why we say that Satan was deposed.  He lost all
authority and all power and he was humiliated, which was the only way to hurt
him.  Otherwise, how can a spirit being be harmed except that they get hit
where they hurt?  Where it hurt Satan was in his pride, because he has always
wanted to be like God.  He had his seat &ldquo;in the temple of God, showing himself
that he is God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But God took him from that high and lofty place, from that
perch, and brought him down to the grave, as Isaiah 14 tells us; that is, He
brought him down from that place and removed all of his authority so that Satan
was nothing and so that he no longer had any official authority of any kind.  </p>

<p>This was what was done on May 21, but do not make the
mistake of thinking that he does not exist right now, because he still exists. 
The teaching of the ten sons of Haman, all the way up until Adar 14 when the
last day of the Jews&rsquo; enemies are killed, is teaching us that Satan still
exists until the end of the world, until God kills all of His enemies.  At that
point, the being of Satan will cease to be, and then it will be complete.  </p>

<p>This is what we read about after King Ahasuerus hanged
Haman, because then his wrath was pacified.  At the end of the judgment on the
ten sons, God&rsquo;s wrath will be pacified.  He will have poured out the
completeness of His wrath and He will have destroyed Satan.  </p>

<p>We will save Esther 8 for next time.  We are running out of
time.  We are running out of weeks.  We have three more weeks.  Next Sunday is
a short Sunday, so we will only be able to do one study.  Maybe in the last
Sunday of February and the first Sunday of March, we will be able to do two
studies each to try and finish the book of Esther.  </p>

<p>Now I would like to just talk about the doubling of the five
months.  Here is a simple way of understanding this.  Stick with the Hebrew
calendar and not the Gregorian calendar.  This is because it becomes very complicated
when two of the Hebrew days overlap one of our days.  </p>

<p>I know that it made my head spin trying to go between the
Gregorian and the Hebrew calendar to try to figure out how it all fits
together.  But God is using the Hebrew calendar when He goes from 2/17 to
7/17.  This was the length of the 150 days in the book of Genesis.  </p>

<p>If we count from 2/17 in the Hebrew calendar, which was May
21, until Adar 15, it is exactly 294 days.  If we then start counting from
Tishri 17 or the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month until Adar 15,
it is exactly 147 days.  It is half that.  This means that the other half must
be from the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month up until Tishri
17.  </p>

<p>The way that God uses numbers, this may not always satisfy
everyone.  For instance, when we read in the Bible that Jesus was &ldquo;three days
and three nights in the heart of the earth,&rdquo; was He?  Yes; because this is what
God says.  But was it three 24-hour periods of time?  </p>

<p>It was Thursday night, a full night.  Then it was Friday night,
a full night.  Then Saturday night, a full night.  But the days were Friday, a
full day.  Then Saturday in the tomb was a full day.  Then He rose early Sunday
morning, and yet God counts that as day three.  He counts Sunday as day three,
and yet it was nowhere near the length of time of day one or day two.  </p>

<p>We have to allow God a little flexibility, and I am just
saying that when we go to look at these numbers, there are different ways of
working them out.  One way was to just go from 2/17 to 12/15.  It is a fact
that this period of time is 294 days.  It is also a fact that Tishri 17, the
day that Genesis 7 gives us, to Adar 15 is half that or 147 days.  In this
case, the first half comes up to the point of 7/17 or on 7/17, but it does not
enter into it.  And this is one way of counting.  </p>

<p>We could also overlap 7/17, which is if we begin counting on
2/18 or on the 18<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  If that is day
one rather then the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, you land
right on 7/17.  This is legitimate, too, because 2/18 would be the first
complete day.  Then, again, we would start on 7/17 and count to Adar 15.  But
in this case, there would be 293 days because we would not be starting on 2/17,
but we would have 147 on both ends because we are overlapping 7/17.  </p>

<p>A third way is what we were talking about before with all of
the things that were taking place on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month and that God was still saving on that day.  It was still the day of the
latter rain.  This could have been what was going on for a couple of hours, but
we do not know the actual time duration.  Maybe there were only one, two, or
three hours left to the day, but then He shut the door.  We could overlap 2/17
and 2/18 and count that as day one, because it would be until 2/18 that we
would have one full day.  </p>

<p>If we do this overlap of 2/17 and 2/18, we have the starting
point of 2/17 and we come to 147 days on Tishri 17.  When we do the same thing
going the other way and we overlap 7/17 and 7/18 all the way to Adar 15 and we
just stop there, this works out, too.  </p>

<p>With three ways of doing this, I am sure that there are
still going to be some critics.  Just imagine trying to pick a date, any date,
like Tishri 17 &ndash; but we did not pick this date; this is in the Bible &ndash; and then
pick two points of time where your date would be in the middle, and then try to
get a period to double and to be the same.  It is not that easy.  </p>

<p>The fact that we are able to do this &ndash; and we did not pick
the starting point of 2/17, we did not pick the dividing point of 7/17, and we
did not pick the end point of 12/15 &ndash; but we have 294 days in that space and
the dividing point of half of that being 147 days.  This is not something that
anyone can manipulate.  This is something that God has worked out.  </p>

<p>This is just a quick review.  I have a couple of written
studies on Facebook that try to lay this out a little bit better, but we will
stop here.  </p>
