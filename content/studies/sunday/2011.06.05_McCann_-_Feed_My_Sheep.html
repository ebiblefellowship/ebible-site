<p>I would like to just talk a little bit about why we are here
today on June 5<sup>th</sup>, when, of course, we were expecting on May 21 that
God would take His people.  I think that John 21 can help us.  I am just going
to look at this quickly and then go into something different.  We read in John
21:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples
at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he <i>himself.</i> There were
together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in
Galilee, and the <i>sons </i>of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. Simon
Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee.
They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they
caught nothing.  </p>

<p>So in darkness, in the night, they did not catch any fish,
not even a single fish.  We can see how this relates to the beginning portion
of the great tribulation, the 2300 evening/mornings when virtually no one was
being saved.  </p>

<p>Remember that the Bible often identifies fish as men.  Jesus
even said to the disciples, &ldquo;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; 
This is the picture that God has of fishing.  When fish are caught, it typifies
those who are caught in the Gospel net.  </p>

<p>There was a previous catch of fish in the gospels where the
net broke.  Now, in John 21, there is going to be another catch of fish,
because this is going to point to the second part of the great tribulation. 
The first part was practically all dark.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 21:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but
the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  </p>

<p>Just like God had to make Himself known to His people as the
Scriptures were unsealed, Jesus was revealing Himself to these disciples.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 21:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to
draw it for the multitude of fishes.  </p>

<p>During the second part of the great tribulation, God told us
that there would be a great multitude who would become saved of every nation,
tongue, tribe, and people.  We read in Revelation 7 of a &ldquo;great multitude&hellip;which
came out of great tribulation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This identifies with the 6100 days from September 7, 1994 until May 21, 2011.  This was the period of the latter rain, and the rain has stopped. 
The rain is over, just like the great tribulation is over; it is now in the
past.  </p>

<p>So here, during this time, there was brought to Jesus a
&ldquo;multitude of fishes.&rdquo;  Then it says in John 21:7-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <i>his </i>fisher's
coat <i>unto him, </i>(for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. And
the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land,
but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. As soon then
as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid
thereon, and bread. Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
caught. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an
hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the
net broken.  </p>

<p>They caught 153 fish, which was a great multitude of fish. 
These were big fish, they were caught in a net, they are brought to Christ, and
they are counted.  They are counted by God.  He did not have to give us the
number.  He could have just left it as a great catch of fish, but He tells us
precisely that it was 153.  </p>

<p>Why is this pertinent to us?  Why is this something that we
really should think about?  The reason is because from May 21 to October 21 is
153 days of our calendar.  </p>

<p>So here we see language relating to a great catch of fish,
and we know that God speaks of a great multitude being saved during the great
tribulation.  These fish are safely brought to Him, all of them; all 153 are
brought to Him.  </p>

<p>This number 153 breaks down into 9 x 17.  What we have from
May 21 to October 21 is 153 days.  Basically, this is 9 periods of 17 days
each.  In a day or two, we will have already passed one of these 17-day
periods.  There will be eight more 17-day periods and then we will land on
October 21.  </p>

<p>We see the number 9, which can be broken down to 3 x 3, and
so we have 3 x 3 x 17 when we break down the number of these fish.  What does
the number 3 point to?  If we look to the Bible to see how God uses the number
3, what is the spiritual meaning of this word &ldquo;three&rdquo;?  The meaning for this
word is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s purpose.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It was His purpose when Jesus went to the cross.  There were
three individuals on a cross, counting Christ.  There were three
superscriptions that were written in three languages.  Jesus went to pray in
the garden three times.  </p>

<p>It seemed to be a horrible thing.  It seemed like nothing
was right because there was God in the flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, and He was
being crucified.  All of His disciples went from Him.  It was the hour of
darkness.  However, by using the number 3 repeatedly, God was letting us know
that this was His purpose that these things happen in the way that they were
happening.  </p>

<p>His disciples were not to have been concerned.  Even though
it looked awful, even though it looked very bad, it was exactly God&rsquo;s purpose
for what Jesus went through.  What He went through, He was to go through.  </p>

<p>We see the same thing here in John 21 where the number 3
appears.  It is very much a part of 153.  This breaks down to 3 x 3 x 17, and
17 has to do with Heaven; and so it is God&rsquo;s purpose for whatever is in view
here.  </p>

<p>First of all, He was to get a great catch of fish, that all
of those whom He intended to save become saved.  They are then brought to Him;
and so we see a great security in this, because they have already been caught
and brought to Him.  </p>

<p>We then read in John 21:12-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Come <i>and </i>dine. And none of the
disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. Jesus then
cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. This is now the
third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen
from the dead.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;This is now the third time.&rdquo;  The number 153 itself has the
number 3 in it twice, and now it is the third time that Jesus is showing
Himself to His disciples.  It is God&rsquo;s purpose.  This is what He is telling
us.  </p>

<p>We might be wondering what is going on.  Things, perhaps,
seem like they are chaotic; there is confusion.  But God here is telling us
that no, this was His purpose.  This was how He wanted things to be.  This was
how He wanted things to turn out.  </p>

<p>The toughest thing for us is to be humbled to the will of
God.  We have our desires and we like things to go the way in which we would
want them to go; and yet, repeatedly, no.  This was God&rsquo;s will.  This was His
purpose.  The quicker we get in line with this and the faster we humble
ourselves under the mighty hand of God &ndash; and the hand represents the will &ndash; the
better things will be for us.  </p>

<p>So here, again, it was the third time that He showed
Himself.  Then we read in John 21:15-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <i>son
</i>of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord;
thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. He saith to
him again the second time, Simon, <i>son </i>of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith
unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my
sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon, <i>son </i>of Jonas, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I
love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  </p>

<p>We see again: three, three, three.  This is what Christ just
did.  He asked the question three times, &ldquo;Lovest thou me?&rdquo;  Peter replied three
times, &ldquo;Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.&rdquo;  (I know that there is a change
in the Greek word for &ldquo;love,&rdquo; but we are not going to look at this today.) 
Christ responds three times, once following each of these; and so, actually, we
see a series of threes.  A third time following this, Jesus replies again,
&ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo;  So He says three times, &ldquo;Feed my sheep. Feed my lambs.  Feed
my sheep.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I am sure that you have heard on the &ldquo;Open Forum&rdquo; Mr.
Camping emphasizing that we are to feed sheep.  He did not pull this out of the
air.  This is from John 21 where the great multitude is taken in.  They are
safe.  They are secure.  Remember that the &ldquo;great multitude&rdquo; of Revelation 7
&ldquo;came out of great tribulation.&rdquo;  It does not say that they came out of five
months.  They came out of great tribulation.  Their salvation is identified
with the 8400-day great tribulation, not with the 153 days.  </p>

<p>So here God is indicating that once the fish are brought to
Him, we are not done yet.  I thought I was done, but take a look at Luke 17. 
This might explain what a lot of us thought and felt.  We read in Luke 17:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle&hellip;  </p>

<p>This has everything to do with the Gospel.  As God lays out
these pictures in the Bible where He speaks of plowing, feeding cattle, and
feeding sheep, they have everything to do with the Gospel and bringing the Word
of God to the world.   </p>

<p class="verse">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us that &ldquo;the field is the world.&rdquo;  People go
out early in the morning into the field, like the parable of the individuals
being hired where there was a group who were hired at the eleventh hour for one
last hour because it was a twelve-hour day.  </p>

<p>So we go out early in the morning to the field.  At the end
of the day, we come out of the field.  Matthew 13 tells us about sowing seed
and how the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest.  The field is
the world and the harvest has to do with &ldquo;the end of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In Luke 17, the servant was &ldquo;plowing or feeding cattle.&rdquo;  He
was working hard.  He was told to go into the field, and then he comes from the
field.  Let me read this again, because this is a question being asked.  It
says in Luke 17:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
meat?  </p>

<p>That is, it is not time to relax yet.  It is not time to
enjoy ourselves, to rest.  No, we still have something to do.  </p>

<p>We read in Luke 17:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and
afterward thou shalt eat and drink?  </p>

<p>So there is a time to be in the field.  They come out of the
field and go into the master&rsquo;s house, but the master now wants his meal.  </p>

<p>Can we see how tired and weary someone might be?  It does
not sound fair.  They just worked all day in the field and they are now coming
out of the field and the master wants them to keep working; he wants them to do
something else.  </p>

<p>Yes, but it is a different work.  It is not the same work as
laboring in the field.  Now, they are personally serving the master.  They are
going to actually set dinner before him, like we read in Luke 17:8-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and
afterward thou shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because he did
the things that were commanded him? I trow not [<i>or I think not</i>]. So
likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you&hellip; 
</p>

<p>They did it all.  </p>

<p>Someone else pointed something out in Hebrews 10.  It is
interesting the way that this is worded.  We read in Hebrews 10:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise.  </p>

<p>This is saying that they already did the will of God.  Is
this not strange?  This is after the work was performed, after we did what Christ
wanted us to do.  After this, we &ldquo;receive the promise.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Hebrews 10:37:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.  </p>

<p>So this is talking about waiting on the Lord after we have
done the will of God.  We know that doing the will of God is an ongoing process
in our lives.  Everyday, the question before us is whether or not we will do
the will of God or our own will.  In a certain aspect, there is a will of God
that has to do with the Gospel.  This Gospel was to be sent into the world, and
this is completed.  This is finished.  </p>

<p>This is why we are not handing out tracts right now.  We are
not handing out tracts, and so I do not know what to do with my hands.  We are
so used to reaching for a tract to hand to someone.  But why are we not doing
this?  We are not doing this because we recognize that something is done,
something has been completed.  </p>

<p>We took off the stickers.  We took the shirts and the hats
off, and so forth, because this has been done.  The latter rain fell, and this
is what brought forth the fruit and the crop.  The door is shut.  This
identified with May 21 and no other day.  </p>

<p>For awhile, we have been thinking, &ldquo;What am I going to do,
because the Bible says, &lsquo;Occupy till I come&rsquo;?&rdquo;  What do we do when we cannot hand
out tracts and witness in these kinds of ways as far as Judgment Day?  What do
we do?  </p>

<p>Well, Luke 17 is still telling us to feed the master, give
him food and give him drink.  Remember also that it says in Matthew 25, where
it talks about the sheep and the goats, that those on the right are blessed of
the Father.  Then it says in Matthew 25:35:   </p>

<p class="verse">For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then it is explained that when someone does this for
individuals who are God&rsquo;s elect that they have done this unto Him.  This is
what we have done when we have shared the Gospel with these people.  </p>

<p>So now the focus is on feeding sheep.  This is God&rsquo;s
purpose.  It is God&rsquo;s will that after we come in from the field, we continue
sharing the Gospel and ministering to others and feeding the sheep.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Ephesians 2.  This is something that I
thought we could look at.  We read in Ephesians 2:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And you <i>hath he quickened, </i>who were dead in trespasses
and sins: Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
the children of disobedience:  </p>

<p>We will just look at this a little bit today.  Maybe we will
pick this up another time.  </p>

<p>Ephesians 2:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And you <i>hath he quickened</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Hath he quickened&rdquo; is italicized, so it is not in the
original.  This was added by the translators because it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;who were dead in trespasses and sins:  </p>

<p>Since we &ldquo;were dead,&rdquo; which is past tense, this means or is
implying that we are now alive; and so the translators added these words:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>hath he quickened</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same idea that we find in Luke 15 where we find
statements made about the prodigal son.  We read in Luke 15:22-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
and put <i>it </i>on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on <i>his </i>feet:
And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill <i>it; </i>and let us eat, and be
merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.
And they began to be merry.  </p>

<p>So this says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this my son was dead, and is alive&hellip;  </p>

<p>Did the prodigal son in this parable physically die?  He did
not physically die.  What he did is that he took his portion of his inheritance
and went and wasted it &ldquo;with riotous living.&rdquo;  He went away from the Father. 
He went his own way.  In this sense, he died.  He was spiritually dead.  He was
not physically dead, but he was spiritually dead.  This is how God views every
sinner.  We are &ldquo;dead in trespasses and sins.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We also read about this in Ezekiel 18:4.  It says in Ezekiel
18:3-4:    </p>

<p class="verse"><i>As </i>I live, saith the Lord JEHOVAH, ye shall not have <i>occasion
</i>any more to use this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine; as the
soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth,
it shall die.  </p>

<p>The soul of man is dead.  Each individual here, at one
point, was dead.  God can save someone from the womb.  If not, we are &ldquo;born,
speaking lies,&rdquo; like Psalm 58 says.  Babies cannot actually speak, so they
cannot lie in that sense; but the heart within the baby is &ldquo;desperately wicked&rdquo;
and &ldquo;deceitful above all <i>things</i>.&rdquo;  Out of this heart, it is as though
there is a flow of communication to God that says, &ldquo;<i>There is </i>no God&rdquo;;
but this is a lie.  </p>

<p>So we are conceived in sin, we are born in sin, and we are
born, because of our sin, dead, spiritually dead.  We have sinned and so we
die.  A baby is just starting physical life.  This baby is not physically dead,
but it is spiritually dead.  </p>

<p>This is what God means, for instance, in Romans 6:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the penalty, the judgment.  The &ldquo;wages of sin&rdquo; is
death for all of us.  We are all dead, spiritually.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what God told Adam and Eve in the book of
Genesis.  He says in Genesis 2:15-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it. And JEHOVAH God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  </p>

<p>This was the Law of God.  This was the complete Law of God
for Adam and Eve.  </p>

<p>How many trees were there?  They were plentiful.  There were
many trees and they could eat of all the trees, except there was one tree that
they could not have.  Satan worked on this.  The Bible tells us that he is a
great deceiver and liar, and so he gets Eve to start thinking about the one
tree that they are not to eat of.  </p>

<p>Is this not true even today?  There are so many things that
we could do that are good, that are right, that are just, that are pure, that
are holy.  There is no Law against doing good and we could have a multitude of
possible things that we might get involved in that could be good, but where do
our minds go?  </p>

<p>They go to the one thing that we know we should not do, to
the thing that we know is against the Law of God.  This is where we are
attracted.  This is where our desire shows itself.  We want that and not all of
the other things that are good and acceptable before God, things that are not
all that exciting to us because we are sinners and have broken the Law of God. 
</p>

<p>Well, God laid down the Law in Genesis 2:17.  Even though
there was probably nothing more special about this one tree than any other
tree, He told them that there was one tree that they could not eat of.  If they
did eat of this one particular tree, He told them:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<span class="underline">in the day</span> that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.  </p>

<p>In the Hebrew, &ldquo;surely&rdquo; is the same word as &ldquo;die&rdquo;; it is
actually doubled.  Some commentators point out that they think it should read,
&ldquo;dying ye shall die,&rdquo; because it is the same Hebrew word; and so they were told
that they would surely die in the day that they ate of the fruit of that one
tree.  </p>

<p>What would you think if God had said this to you?  Well, we
have Eve telling us, as she was in conversation with the serpent, what she
thought this meant.  Remember that Eve had not been created as yet when God
spoke to Adam about the eating of this tree, and so Adam probably shared this
with her because she would come out of his ribs.  Maybe she did not hear this
firsthand.  I do not think she did.  I think that she heard this from her
husband.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 3:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
which JEHOVAH God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  </p>

<p>So now Satan is going back to the statement that God had
made when Eve was not there.  I am not sure if God had reiterated this later to
her or if Adam would have just passed this on to her, which is how God works. 
He shares something, let us say, with Noah, and then Noah, as a preacher, tells
everyone else.  We do not read that God told Noah&rsquo;s wife about the flood.  He
spoke to Noah.  </p>

<p>Since God told Adam, and Adam had a responsibility for his
wife - just like husbands today have the responsibility to love their wives,
which would include giving them information from the Bible or the Gospel &ndash; Eve
heard about this.  Now Satan is coming to her rather than to Adam who probably
heard this directly from God.  Satan is coming to Eve to test how well her
hearing was.  </p>

<p>We continue reading in Genesis 3:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the
garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which <i>is </i>in the midst
of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
it, lest ye die.  </p>

<p>She had one part right.  They were not to eat of the fruit
of that tree, but we do not read that God said, &ldquo;Neither shall ye touch it,&rdquo;
even though this would have been a wise thing.  </p>

<p>We do not want to get as close as we can to a sinful desire
without actually committing it, which is what we actually tend to do.  If we
are heading in a sinful direction, we try to get closer and closer to it.  This
is almost like going over and touching the tree, which is really tempting God,
&ldquo;Let me just touch the tree.  Am I going to die if I touch this tree?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God did say, &ldquo;Thou shalt not eat of it,&rdquo; and so the best
thing to do would be to get away from the tree.  Forget about the tree and look
at everything else that is fine and good and proper, which is good instruction
for us today.  We are to &ldquo;abstain from all appearance of evil.&rdquo;  Do not go
anywhere near the tree and you will be much safer.  </p>

<p>Notice how Satan responds in Genesis 3:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  </p>

<p>Again, this is doubled, &ldquo;Ye shall not dying ye shall die.&rdquo; 
This Hebrew word for &ldquo;surely&rdquo; is the same word for &ldquo;dying&rdquo; or &ldquo;die&rdquo;; and so the
serpent said to the woman:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall not surely die:  </p>

<p>God said that they were going to die.  Satan said that they
were not going to die.  This is the contest.  Who is involved in this contest? 
The whole human race is involved, because we were all in the loins of Adam.  If
man disobeys God and dies, as God has said, this is a judgment on all mankind. 
This is a worldwide judgment.  This may even be greater than the final judgment
because this impacts every single human being, even from past generations.  </p>

<p>So the contest is who is speaking the truth, who can be trusted,
and who is lying.  Satan is blatantly lying here and being deceptive, which is
his nature.  The Bible tells us, &ldquo;For he is a liar, and the father of it.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We read in 2 Corinthians 11:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ.  </p>

<p>So &ldquo;the serpent beguiled Eve.&rdquo;  He deceived her.  God tells
us that the woman is &ldquo;the weaker vessel.&rdquo;  This is related to why women should
not teach.  </p>

<p>We read in 1 Timothy 2:11-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer
not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in
silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but
the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  </p>

<p>Again, it could be that Adam heard this directly from God,
very straightly and clearly.  Eve came out of the side of Adam a little while
later, and then he would have shared this with his wife.  There are other
reasons for why God says that the woman was deceived and Adam was not, even
though Adam ate of the fruit.  After Eve ate of it, she gave it to him and he
ate.  </p>

<p>What was going through his mind?  Why would he disobey God? 
I do not know, except that he does later say, &ldquo;The woman whom thou gavest <i>to
be </i>with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&rdquo;  Adam was almost
trying to blame this on God because God had given Eve to Adam for a wife, and
yet it was just a horrible and terrible thing that Adam and Eve did eat of the
fruit of the tree.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Genesis 3, Satan is speaking to the woman
and he is very subtle, very deceptive; it is hard to pin him down.  Remember
that we read in 2 Corinthians 11 that he would come as &ldquo;an angel of light,&rdquo;
looking like Christ.  He entered the serpent and this serpent was not like the
serpents that we see in our day.  This was a wise creature and a good creature
before Satan entered into it.  He speaks to the woman, making her think; but he
is trying to get her to doubt.  His goal was to get her to doubt the Word of
God.  </p>

<p>He has the same goal today, as there are numerous different
Bible versions in the English language.  If you have ever been to a Bible study
where they go around a circle of people and have everyone read from their
Bibles, it is so different from one translation to another translation that
people can easily begin to wonder, &ldquo;Hath God said?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we read in Genesis 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  </p>

<p>Is it a wonderful thing that we know all about evil?  No;
this is horrible!  </p>

<p>When our children are young, one reason why this is such a
blessing is because they know so little about evil.  They themselves are evil because
sin is evil.  The Bible says, &ldquo;Who can bring a clean <i>thing </i>out of an
unclean?&rdquo;  Since we are all unclean, the children are all unclean; but there is
still the matter of how much understanding they have of the world.  </p>

<p>The world thinks that it is a wonderful thing to know all
about what is going on, when it is not.  It is very sad to see young children
today, very young children, so worldly-wise.  They can get this way through
watching the television, through the Internet, through their friends, and everything
else.  It is not a good thing to have knowledge of evil.  </p>

<p>God even tells us, &ldquo;In malice [<i>evil</i>] be ye children.&rdquo; 
Be like a child.  We do not have to know all of the horrible things that are
going on.  We do not have to know about the serial killer, all of these things
that men do to other men.  We can spend time in the Bible, rather than learning
about all of the horrible things in this world.  </p>

<p>So here is the contest.  God says that they will die in that
day.  Satan says that they will not die.  Then we read in Genesis 3:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when the woman saw that the tree <i>was </i>good for food,
and that it <i>was </i>pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <i>one
</i>wise&hellip;  </p>

<p>Wow!  It sure looked good!  This is just like &ldquo;the pleasures
of sin.&rdquo;  They sure look good, and yet we know how horrible this was.    </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.  </p>

<p>Then they both fell down dead, right?  No; they did not fall
down dead.  She took a bite.  She gave it to Adam.  He took a bite.  Then
something happened, because they realized that they were naked; but that was
not death.  They realized that they were naked and then God came and asked them
what they had done.  He pronounced the cursed and then all kinds of things got
much more difficult for them.  </p>

<p>This is what sin always brings.  It never brings anything
good.  It brings misery and trouble and the curse.  But even though God cursed
the creation and they would now have to work by the sweat of their brow and
things would be difficult, this was not death.  This was not physical death.  God
said, &ldquo;For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,&rdquo; and then
Satan said, &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So here we have Adam and Eve standing there after eating of
the fruit.  Maybe they had a very tense day after this.  Maybe they were
wondering during this whole day, during this 24-hour period, &ldquo;Maybe I am going
to die at some point.&rdquo;  They went through the whole day, but they did not die.  </p>

<p>Imagine that you were an outward observer.  You heard what
God said.  You heard what the devil said.  Then you saw them eat the fruit. 
Then they are standing there perfectly normal.  </p>

<p>Who won the contest?  Satan must have won.  He must have
been telling the truth.  But, no, he did not win.  He did not tell the truth;
but to the outward eye, to the outward observer, it sure looked like he won. 
In the physical realm, they did not die.  </p>

<p>We know that &ldquo;the soul that sinneth, it shall die.&rdquo;  We are &ldquo;dead
in trespasses and sins.&rdquo;  This is a spiritual death.  It is spiritual.  It is
something that we cannot see.  It is something that we cannot touch, but it is
something that is very real and very horrible.  </p>

<p>May 21, 2011 was a spiritual judgment on the world that
nobody could see.  Therefore, to the world, it was nothing because nothing
happened.  This was just like anyone looking at Adam and Eve.  Nothing happened
to them, except they realized that they were naked; and so they had more
knowledge.  </p>

<p>I guess we can see the point.  The point is that God told
them, &ldquo;For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,&rdquo; but He
did not get specific.  Since He did not get specific, they might have had their
own ideas as to what He meant.  </p>

<p>In reading this, we would also think that they should have
dropped over dead like the couple in the New Testament.  In Acts 5, Ananias and
Sapphira came before Peter and lied to the Holy Spirit.  When they did this,
they dropped down dead right away.  The husband was carried out first; then the
wife was carried out later.  </p>

<p>This is what we were looking for on May 21.  We were looking
for a physical judgment, something that everybody would see, something that
would be very obvious.  This is what we told people.  We were wrong concerning
some of the details; but when we told people that May 21 was Judgment Day, that
was true.  When we told them that the Bible guaranteed this, that was true.  It
was judgment.  It was a judgment like God pronounced on Adam and Eve where they
eventually died.  Adam died at the age of nine hundred and thirty years, but he
did die as a result of what happened that day, even though he did not die
immediately.  </p>

<p>So this is the situation today.  If anyone wants to know
where we are, we are expecting October 21 to be the end; because God can bring
a spiritual judgment.  When He does, it is not a light thing.  </p>

<p>Look at all of the consequences of the judgment on Adam and
Eve of the day that they died in their soul.  Was that a light thing?  Was that
nothing?  That was a very real and horribly tremendous judgment on them, on us,
and on all mankind, even though they could not see it.  </p>

<p>When God shut the door on May 21, when the latter rain
ceased to fall on May 21, this was an awful judgment that God brought on the
world.  </p>
