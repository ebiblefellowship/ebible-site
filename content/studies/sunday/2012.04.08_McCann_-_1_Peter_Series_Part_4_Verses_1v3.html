<p>As everyone is aware, today is Easter Sunday, the day that
we remember when Christ rose from the dead.  It so happens that in our study of
1<sup>st</sup> Peter, we are going to touch on this subject because we read in 1Peter
1:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, To an inheritance
incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for
you,  </p>

<p>We left off last week after reviewing the first two verses
of 1<sup>st</sup> Peter 1.  Now, verse 3 is looking at the resurrection of
Christ from the dead.  </p>

<p>I would like to look at this whole verse, so let us begin at
the beginning of verse 3, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a fairly common statement in the New Testament.  For
instance, it says in Galatians 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)  </p>

<p>This is worded a little differently, but this is saying the
same thing.  What I would especially like to notice about the opening line of
1Peter 1:3 is that this is not saying &ldquo;God and the Father of the believers&rdquo;;
this is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;   </p>

<p>The emphasis is on the relationship between God the Father
and Christ the Son.  </p>

<p>Of course, God is blessed.  He is glorious and it is always
good to bless God.  We normally say, &ldquo;<span class="underline">May</span> God bless you,&rdquo; because we
realize that we have no power within ourselves to bless anyone.  Therefore, we
wish and it is our desire that God bless someone; but it is also appropriate to
just simply recognize that God is blessed in Himself, that He is the Blessed
One and the Blessed God.  Here, the focus is on His being the Father of the
Lord Jesus, of His Son.  But before we get into this, we also have to remember
that Jesus is eternal God.  </p>

<p>The Godhead is a mystery and we are not going to solve
that.  No one ever will.  God reveals Himself in the Bible as one God, yet
three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>We cannot dissect them.  We cannot try to figure this out. 
It is beyond our ability to understand how God can be one and yet three.  This
is because He is God.  He is eternal and infinite, but we are a creature.  We
are finite and temporal.  We do not have the ability to grasp the eternal
person of God, His eternal being.  In particular, something that we cannot
grasp is how this can be; but this is true and this is a fact.  </p>

<p>We find in Isaiah 9:6, the wonderful verse that we hear
every Christmas season, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.  </p>

<p>So the child who was to be born and the Son who was to be given
was Himself, The Everlasting Father, and this is referring to Jesus.  We know
this without any question.  </p>

<p>This is why Jesus said in John, or the Fourth Gospel, 10:30:  </p>

<p class="verse">I and <i>my </i>Father are one.  </p>

<p>We cannot separate them.  This, of course, leaves us scratching
our heads in trying to understand how they can be one when we read of God the
Father speaking from Heaven and Christ the Son can speaking from earth and that
they sometimes did this at the same time; but they are one.  </p>

<p>This is what the Bible says, but the Jews recognized that
Jesus, in saying this kind of thing, was making Himself to be God, equal to God,
one and the same with God.  In one sense, there was no difference or no
distinction between Christ and God the Father.  Yet on another level, there is
a very definite distinction.  Even though they are one, one is spoken of as the
Father and the other is spoken of as the Son; and, again, we are going to leave
that.  </p>

<p>We want to take a look at this relationship between the Father
and Son, because this has everything to do with the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus Christ.  This has everything to do with when He rose from the dead and
made complete payment for the sins of His people.  </p>

<p>He did this because the penalty for their sins was death,
and He paid this penalty in full.  As a result of Christ paying the penalty and
rising from the dead victoriously in fulfilling the payment and in completing
the payment for the sins of His people, this is what led to Jesus, for
instance, being called the Son of God.  </p>

<p>In Romans 1:3-4, we read this:  </p>

<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh; And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God
with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
dead:  </p>

<p>God will sometimes really fill out a verse and we can lose
track of what is being said at times, but let us read this again.  This time, I
will leave out the middle statement.  Of course, this is an important
statement.  I am doing this just so that we can get the sense of what is being
declared concerning Christ.  </p>

<p>It says again in Romans 1:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And declared <i>to be </i>the Son of God&hellip;    </p>

<p>Then look at the concluding part of this verse:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by [<i>or through</i>] the resurrection from the dead:  </p>

<p>This is why Jesus is said to be the Son of God.  </p>

<p>A son is begotten of the father.  Amongst men, the son has a
beginning.  The husband and the wife or the man and the woman have children. 
They have a child or a son and that son has a beginning.  </p>

<p>God the Father had a Son who was Jesus, but this was the
result of His rising from the dead.  This is because Jesus had no beginning. 
He is eternal God.  We cannot go back to some point in eternity past and say
that Jesus was born at a certain time or that He had a beginning at a certain
point.  No; He has always been God.  He has always been the Word, as we read in
John 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.  </p>

<p>He has always been God Himself, yet there was one instance
or one point in eternity past before the creation in which it could be said
that Christ had a beginning, in a sense.  This was when He died for the sins of
His people and He rose again before the world began, as Revelation 13:8 tells
us where it states that Jesus was:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>This is why Romans 1 is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord&hellip;</p>

<p>And that He was &ldquo;declared <i>to be </i>the Son&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by [<i>or via</i>] the resurrection from the dead:  </p>

<p>This is a very helpful statement that helps us to begin to
understand the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son.  Of
course, this has all kinds of implications regarding what took place at the
cross in 33 A.D.  </p>

<p>As we look at this, and we will look at a few more things
that will show without any question and beyond any possible doubt that Christ
died for the sins of His people and rose again or was resurrected before the
world began.  He did not bear sin at the time that He entered into the world
and became the Son of Man.  He was not bearing any sin when He went to the
cross, because the bearing of sin was a one-time event.  He offered Himself for
the sins of His people once and there would never be another need to do this.  </p>

<p>When does Hebrews 9 tell us that this one offering took
place?  Let us quickly look at this.  I will start reading in verse 25.  It
says in Hebrews 9:25-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; For then must he
often have suffered since [<i>this is the same word as &ldquo;from&rdquo;</i>] the
foundation of the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is clearly making the statement that Christ&rsquo;s once
offering for sin took place from the foundation of the world.  If He were like
an earthly high priest, if He were like Aaron or his descendants, then He would
need to continually offer Himself again and again.  </p>

<p>People do not realize this but when they insist and demand
that Christ was paying for sins at 33 A.D., they are, in a sense, trying to
make Him more in the lines of Aaron, who was the type and the figure of a
priest.  They are trying to indicate that the one payment from the foundation
of the world was not sufficient and that He had to do it again.  But, there is
no way.  He paid for the sins of His people once and that payment was made from
the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>Continuing with the thought of why God is the Father of the
Lord Jesus Christ, let us look at Romans 8:29.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <i>to be </i>conformed
to the image of his Son, that he might be the <span class="underline">firstborn</span> among many
brethren.  </p>

<p>Here, Christ is called &ldquo;the firstborn&rdquo; Son.  He is the
firstborn of the Father.  God is also referring to His election program and His
plan to predestinate those whom He chose from before the foundation of the
world, all of who would be, in time, as they experienced salvation, conformed
to the image of His Son, as Jesus is &ldquo;the firstborn among many brethren&rdquo;; that
is, He was the firstborn Son of God, but many sons would follow.  </p>

<p>This is as it says in Hebrews 12:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the general assembly and church of the <span class="underline">firstborn</span>,
which are written in heaven&hellip;  </p>

<p>So we, as the eternal Church, could actually call ourselves
the &ldquo;church of the firstborn.&rdquo;  We are added to the body of Christ.  We are
sons and daughters.  We are children of God, but Jesus is the all-important one
because He was the first to rise from the dead.  This is what the firstborn Son
of God is actually referring to.  </p>

<p>If we look at Revelation 1:5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And from Jesus Christ, <i>who is </i>the faithful witness, <i>and
</i>the <span class="underline">first begotten</span> of the dead&hellip;    </p>

<p>In the Greek, &ldquo;first begotten&rdquo; is the same word that is
translated as &ldquo;firstborn.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Jesus Christ, <i>who is </i>the faithful witness, <i>and </i>the
first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here, we are getting more information.  He was the
firstborn, but this was not because some time in eternity past God determined
to have a son and begat Jesus, like men beget their children today, and that,
therefore, Christ had a beginning point.  No; He is the firstborn because in
eternity past, before the foundation of the world, before this world began, God
developed His salvation plan.  He knew that He would create this world, He knew
that mankind would fall into sin, and He knew that there must be a Saviour.  </p>

<p>God did all of this.  He allowed sin to occur in order to
develop His salvation plan and to put this on display to all of the
principalities in heavenly places; that is, all who are within the Kingdom of Heaven,
which includes all of the creations that God has certainly been creating.  God
put this creation on display, allowing sin to occur and to develop.  Then
before the world began, He also knew that in order to save certain people, an
elect people, not the majority but a remnant out of the total sum of mankind
that would probably number about 200 million people, Christ had to bear their
sins.  </p>

<p>The Word of God, eternal God, took upon Himself the sins of
all of these individuals who would live during various points in time, with the
vast majority of them living at the time of the end during the time of the
great tribulation, because the Bible tells us that &ldquo;a great multitude, which no
man could number&rdquo; would be saved out of great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Yet whether it was Abel and his sins, Abel being one of the
first men in the very beginning of time, or whether it was the sins of a great
multitude of people alive at the end of time, all of God&rsquo;s chosen people had all
of their sins placed on Christ and He bore them in His own body on the tree.  </p>

<p>Some try to use this reference in 1<sup>st</sup> Peter to
say that this indicates that Christ bore sins on the cross in 33 A.D.  It does
say in 1 Peter 2:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree&hellip;    </p>

<p>But we have to understand that the tree or the cross is
teaching us something, because whoever is hanged on a tree is &ldquo;made a curse.&rdquo; 
He is accursed from God.  Therefore, we do not have to understand that there
was a tree created somehow before time, before the world, before trees were
made.  No; this is just language indicating that Christ became accursed before
time, before trees, before the world began.  He took upon Himself the sins of
His people.  As a result, He became accursed before God as God began to punish
Him and to pour out His wrath upon Him.  </p>

<p>What is the punishment for sin?  The Bible is clear about
this all the way through:  &ldquo;the wages of sin <i>is </i>death,&rdquo; and Jesus was
slain as the Lamb laden with the sins of His people, before the world began,
from the foundation of the world.  In that sense, He was accursed as He was
dying on the tree.  </p>

<p>Was He the Son when He was dying?  No, not yet.  He was not
declared to be the Son except through the resurrection of the dead.  It is when
He rises that He is called the Son.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Hebrews 1 and take a look at a couple of
verses.  It says in Hebrews 1:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us
by <i>his </i>Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds;  </p>

<p>This is very important and God carefully explains this. 
Notice that the Bible emphasizes that God speaks to us by His Son and that it
is by His Son that He &ldquo;made the worlds.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why is this important?  This is important because, according
to Romans 1:3-4, Jesus was not called the Son until He rose from the dead.  As
the Son of God, He &ldquo;made the worlds.&rdquo;  Since He is eternal God, He created.  He
spoke, as we read in Genesis 1, and the universe came into being.  He spoke and
He populated the world with animals.  He spoke and mankind was created, and so
on; and He did all of this already as the Son of God.  He was already the Son
of the Father, and He could only be the Son of the Father through the
resurrection of the dead.  </p>

<p>There is a strong support for this in a passage that we read
in Colossians 1.  In Colossians 1, it is speaking of the Lord Jesus.  It says
in Colossians 1:12-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from
the power of darkness, and hath translated <i>us </i>into the kingdom of his
dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, <i>even </i>the
forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
every creature:  </p>

<p>Again, Jesus is called the firstborn, but remember why He is
called this.  It is because He is the &ldquo;first begotten of the dead,&rdquo; according
to Revelation 1:5; and so God is now referring to Jesus as the firstborn.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Colossians 1:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">For by him [<i>by Jesus, the firstborn Son</i>] were all things
created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
whether <i>they be </i>thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by
him all things consist.</p>

<p>Once again, God is linking the information that Jesus, as
the firstborn, was the Creator.  </p>

<p>In Hebrews 1, He makes a point of stressing that it was the
Son who created the world.  This is because He wants us to know this.  He does
not want us to at all miss the fact that this is how it had to be.  He does not
want us to miss that there is no other possibility.  There is no other way that
Christ could be the Son of God, and He was declared to be the Son before this
world even began.  </p>

<p>If you read the Gospel accounts, Christ is repeatedly called
the Son long before He went to the cross.  Remember what it says in John 3:16: 
</p>

<p class="verse">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son&hellip; 
  </p>

<p>This is past tense because long before time, He was given in
eternity past before the world even began.  This is how the Father gave His
&ldquo;only begotten Son.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Notice the next verse in Colossians where this is definitely
said in order that we do not miss this.  It says in Colossians 1:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <i>things </i>he might have
the preeminence.  </p>

<p>He was the firstborn and He created the world, yet He is the
firstborn from the dead.  This is how He became the Son and was &ldquo;declared <i>to
be </i>the Son of God with power.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We are kind of covering ground that we learned through
Family Radio and Mr. Camping.  He taught on this a couple of years ago.  But I
do not think that we have also looked at the other side of the coin; or, at
least, I cannot remember if we did, even though it might have been addressed.  </p>

<p>The other side of the coin is that if Jesus became the Son
through the resurrection of the dead, would this also not mean that the Father
became the Father of the Son at that same point or at that same instance? 
Someone becomes a father when they have a child or a son.  </p>

<p>So, in a sense, God is focusing in on the resurrection of
the dead when Christ was the firstborn at that point.  Therefore, at that
point, the Father now is said to be the Father.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Hebrews 1.  We read the first two verses,
so I will begin in verse 3.  It says in Hebrews 1:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who being the brightness of <i>his </i>glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he
had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high; Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he
at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?&hellip; </p>

<p>God is indicating that there was a point when this
happened.  He is referring to Christ and He is using the word &ldquo;day,&rdquo; even
though time was not involved in eternity past.  In order to help us understand
something, however, God is using a time reference and saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;this day have I begotten thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, Christ became the Son.  Then it continues on to
say:  </p>

<p class="verse">And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a
Son?  </p>

<p>Here we have the relationship of God the Father and God the
Son, and it all revolves around and centers on the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus.  This is what God is telling us, which is that this was when Christ was
declared to be the Son and that this was when the Father, in a sense, became
the Father of the Son.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to 1<sup>st</sup> Peter.  It says again in
1Peter 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>be </i>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Notice the reference here to &ldquo;abundant mercy.&rdquo;  It is
through God&rsquo;s abundant mercy in developing and in fulfilling His salvation
plan, in bringing it all to pass, in taking the sins of sinners, of rebels, of
those individuals whom He would save out of all of mankind, taking the sins of
a great multitude of people, their filthy sins, their ugly sins, their unholy,
dirty, and rotten sins.  </p>

<p>We cannot say enough about how bad they are when we think of
how good God is and how holy and pure and clean and right and just and perfect
that God is in His person.  He has never sinned.  He abhors evil.  He cannot
stand to have anything to do with sin, and yet this same holy God, this same
glorious Being developed a plan of salvation in which He took upon Himself
these filthy sins.  </p>

<p>We kind of characterize certain sins as filthy and others as
maybe not so bad.  We talk about little white lies.  Even within ourselves, we
allow ourselves a little bit of this particular wrong thing and a little bit of
that particular wrong thing, and we do not think that this is all that awful. 
We save the description of filthy and rotten for the things that make the
headlines by other individuals.  We do not normally apply this to ourselves,
but when we look at how the Bible views sin and how God views sin in His
holiness and in His perfect purity and when we understand that one sin, such as
the eating of the fruit that God said that they should not have eaten, when we
look at just one sin, we see how it is able to bring the condemnation of God
upon mankind as it has or as James 2:10 tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i>point,
</i>he is guilty of all.  </p>

<p>If we keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, we are
guilty of all.  We can understand that one sin is just as ugly as any other
sin; yet God, in His tremendous and abundant mercy, has developed a plan to not
take just one sin but a multitude of sins.  </p>

<p>It says in 1Peter 4:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity [<i>or love</i>] among
yourselves: for charity [<i>or love</i>] shall cover the multitude of sins.  </p>

<p>Christ is love; God is love.  He is the one who covers the
multitude of the sins of His people.  </p>

<p>First of all, there is a multitude of sinners, with each one
bearing a multitude of sins.  The number of transgressions is enormous, but
they were all laid upon Christ and He made payment for them and then He gives
the gift of faith or the gift of salvation to His people.  This is why it is
abundant mercy that has begotten us, the children of God or the elect people of
God.  </p>

<p>1Peter 1:3 says that He has &ldquo;begotten us again,&rdquo; and this is
all one Greek word.  The word translated &ldquo;again&rdquo; is not a separate word.  It is
all the translation of one Greek word, and this Greek word is only found in one
other place.  This is also in 1<sup>st</sup> Peter 1, a little later towards
the end of the chapter.  </p>

<p>We read in 1Peter 1:23:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Being born again</span>, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  </p>

<p>This three-word phrase &ldquo;being born again&rdquo; is the same Greek
word that is translated in 1Peter 1:3 as &ldquo;begotten us again.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we can see that this word has everything to do with the
new birth, with receiving a new heart and a new spirit and being born again;
and it is according to His abundant mercy that has made us born again, that has
brought a new birth to us and that has made us new creatures in God&rsquo;s sight.  </p>

<p>1Peter 1:3 goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead,  </p>

<p>God has saved His people and, hopefully, all listening today
are His people and all have been born again.  We hope this.  Of course, who is
or is not saved is in God&rsquo;s hands.  We do not know who are or are not His
elect, but we know that God has made us born again by His Word and according to
His great mercy and that He has made us born again &ldquo;unto a lively hope.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;lively&rdquo; means &ldquo;living.&rdquo;  First of all, we are made
alive.  We were dead in trespasses and sins, according to Ephesians 2:1; but
God is giving us a living hope.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; is actually a synonym for Christ Himself.  Just
like &ldquo;faith&rdquo; is a synonym for Christ and just like &ldquo;love&rdquo; is a synonym for
Christ and just like &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is a synonym for Christ and just like &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; is
a synonym for Christ, &ldquo;hope&rdquo; is also a synonym for Christ.  We are made born
again unto a living hope or unto the living Lord Jesus Christ by His
resurrection from the dead.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at a few verses where the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; is
used.  Romans 8:24 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  </p>

<p>We are saved by hope, and who saves us?  Jesus Christ saves
us; and so we are saved by hope, which is a word that God uses as a substitute
for the name of Christ.  </p>

<p>Also, Romans 12:12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
prayer;  </p>

<p>We rejoice in Christ.  He is our hope.  </p>

<p>Ephesians 2:12 speaks of those who are not saved who are in
this world:  </p>

<p class="verse">That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
 of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
without God in the world:  </p>

<p>So being without God or without Christ is being without
hope.  </p>

<p>We read in Colossians 1:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">To whom God would make known what <i>is </i>the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory:  </p>

<p>The last verse is 1Timothy 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <i>which is </i>our hope;  </p>

<p>Of course, hope is also a word that expresses our
dependence, our desire, our great expectation as we look towards Jesus, but
this word itself is fulfilled or embodied by Jesus; and so we are begotten
again unto a lively or a living hope because Christ is alive.  He has risen
from the dead.  </p>

<p>Since He is alive and since He is the firstborn to rise from
the dead and since He is the living hope for each member of the &ldquo;church of the
firstborn&rdquo; or the children of God, we will also rise from the dead.  We will
live forever in the new heavens and new earth.  </p>

<p>We would, of course, want this sooner than later, we would
want this to have already taken place, but it has not and we are now at a time
when we have to wait on God.  Maybe He will open up more information.  We
cannot say that He will not do this; and so we wait.  </p>

<p>But no matter how ever long we wait, whether it is for
another day or for another month or for another year, no matter how long, the
time is really insignificant because this is the nature of this world.  Time
passes.  It is temporal and finite and very limited; and this is what makes all
things vain regarding this world and this life.  </p>

<p>Yet the Word of God abides forever.  God is eternal.  At
some point, He will bring His people into that resurrection experience of the
body and we will forever be with the Lord.  This is the living hope that we
have because of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
