<p>Ephesians 6 is a chapter that has some very good instruction
in the early verses for each one of us, such as, &ldquo;Children, obey your parents,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Honour thy father and mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Servants, be obedient.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>These things never change.  They are never done away with. 
This is God&rsquo;s will for man.  This is God&rsquo;s will for people.  </p>

<p>Further down, it says in verse 10, Ephesians 6:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Finally, my brethren&hellip;  </p>

<p>It interesting that He does say, &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; because we say
&ldquo;finally&rdquo; when we are at the end of something.  </p>

<p>So God says in Ephesians 6:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might.  </p>

<p>This is the only way that a child of God could be strong,
because we have no strength.  We have no might against the things that are
against us in this world, the spiritual forces, the world itself.  </p>

<p>Just look right now at the enemies, I guess we could say, of
the true believer.  We have a right understanding of the truth, which is that
Judgment Day did happen on May 21, and yet it practically feels like the whole
world is against the believer now.  Of course, the world has always been
against the believer, but it surely feels like the whole world and the whole
church have finally joined hands and that they have some agreement in their
opposition to this little ministry called Family Radio and to those who believe
that Judgment Day was May 21.  </p>

<p>This is an awful lot of pressure.  This is an awful lot of
opposition that is coming against the child of God.  The believer can really
feel like, &ldquo;Wow!  It seems like everything is against me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So where do we get the strength?  Many individuals are not
going to find this strength, because they are looking to themselves.  They do
not have a real relationship with God, and so they are going to buckle under. 
Actually, one minute after midnight on May 21<sup>st</sup> or May 22<sup>nd</sup>,
some people had already hightailed it for the hills.  Some 84 hours later,
others took off, too.  Maybe after 40 days, more will; because I think that it
is pretty certain that we are here for five months.  The pressure is here, the
forces are against the children of God, and so where can the believer find
strength?  </p>

<p>It says in Ephesians 3:14-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, That he would
grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might
by his Spirit in the inner man; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;
that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all
saints what <i>is </i>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to
know the love of Christ&hellip;  </p>

<p>So here God speaks of being granted or given strength &ldquo;with
might by his Spirit in the inner man.&rdquo;  This would be the new born-again soul
and the Spirit of Christ dwelling within the believer.  This is where the
strength is.  It is within God.  It is not in any individual.  It is not in any
person.  </p>

<p>Ephesians 6:10 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ephesians 6:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i>places.</i>  </p>

<p>This was very evident.  This was actually very evident,
especially leading up to May 21 when we were receiving communication from
practically everywhere.  </p>

<p>Robert just showed me the phone bill.  We had an 800 number
and people could call and leave messages, and they did, but so many of the
messages were alike.  It was unbelievable.  We got emails by the thousands. 
Many of these were so alike, whether in the church or out of the church.  </p>

<p>People were full of anger.  We heard consistently from those
in the church, &ldquo;No man knows the day our hour.&rdquo;  From those outside of the
church, we heard, &ldquo;You are idiots and morons for trusting that Book, the
Bible.&rdquo;  But all were in agreement that we were wrong and they were full of
anger.  It did not matter if someone was from South America or Canada or the United
  States or Europe; it was like one person wrote these emails.  It was really
eerie.  </p>

<p>Why is that?  The reason is because there was a force, a
spiritual force at work that was evident.  </p>

<p>If we look at Ephesians 2, it says in Ephesians 2:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And you <i>hath he quickened, </i>who were dead in trespasses
and sins: Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
the children of disobedience:  </p>

<p>God has a Spirit and He works in the true believers.    </p>

<p>Remember that it says in Philippians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his
</i>good pleasure.  </p>

<p>Here is the Spirit of God who works in the child of God to
do things that are according to His will, things that are right and obedient to
His will.  We can never take any credit, because we recognize that this is
God&rsquo;s Spirit working in us to keep His commandments; and yet, on the other
hand, Ephesians tells us that there is another sprit that can work in unsaved
individuals to accomplish his purposes.  </p>

<p>Have you ever thought about Job&rsquo;s wife?  Poor Job&rsquo;s wife; I
mean, she suffered along with him.  We think about Job suffering, but she lost
all of her riches, too.  She lost ten children.  She was shaken to the core,
and then her husband had boils from head to toe.  It just looked like, &ldquo;Wow! 
This man whom I married is cursed and cursed again from God&rdquo;; and so finally
she says, &ldquo;Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.&rdquo;  (This
is some advice that people have given me recently.)  She said, &ldquo;Curse God, and
die,&rdquo; but she was just speaking out of the bitterness of her soul.  </p>

<p>Go back to Job.  What is amazing about this is when we look
at Job 2, because Satan, at that time, was able to enter into Heaven.  I do not
know why God allowed this, but He did.  It says in Job 2:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before JEHOVAH, and Satan came also among them to present himself
before JEHOVAH. And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
answered JEHOVAH, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from
walking up and down in it. And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my
servant Job, that <i>there is </i>none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
fast his integrity&hellip;  </p>

<p>By the way, this is a good question for each one of us.  Are
we?  When things did not go like we thought they would, are we holding fast our
integrity?  Are we holding to the Word of God and just trusting Him and His
Word?  God is not a liar.  He is not a liar.  His Word is true and faithful and
can be trusted completely.  Are we holding fast?  </p>

<p>There are those who would have the believer renounce many
truths.  People begin by saying that they want us to apologize for May 21. 
This is just where they start, but then they are going to want us to renounce
our whole methodology of understanding the Bible and how we compare Scripture
with Scripture and seek for spiritual understanding.  They want us to accept
the church&rsquo;s position on this and that and the other thing should we want to be
received back with open arms.  </p>

<p>Of course, we would if these things were true, but they are
not true.  The churches do not have the truth.  They do not know how to find
truth.  This has not changed.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say here in Job 2:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst
me against him, to destroy him without cause. And Satan answered JEHOVAH, and
said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But
put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse
thee to thy face.  </p>

<p>This is what Satan said.  This was his accusation.  </p>

<p>What does God say about Satan in Revelation 12?  In
Revelation 12, Satan is being cast out of Heaven.  It says in Revelation
12:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before
our God day and night.  </p>

<p>Satan was not just accusing Job.  What we read earlier was
not a single instance; it was his normal thing.  He would go to God and pick
out this believer and pick out that believer.  Remember that he argued with God
about &ldquo;the body of Moses,&rdquo; which we read about in the book of Jude.  It was
Satan&rsquo;s normal activity to go to God and to try to find fault with the people
of God.  God, of course, finally cast him out and he no longer had access to
God like he did in the days when Job was alive.  </p>

<p>So Satan went before God and accused Job of obeying God only
because God had made things so easy for him.  Then God said that He would allow
certain things to happen to Job, and then all of those catastrophes came upon
Job.  But Satan was not done.  Yes, Job still retained his integrity, but Satan
then said that if God were to inflict his body or to go after his flesh, Job
would then curse God to His face.  </p>

<p>We wonder sometimes why we are here.  Imagine that you are
Job.  What did you do that these terrible things should come upon you?  You did
everything right.  You did everything proper, and yet calamity after calamity
came upon you, evil thing after evil thing, without explanation.  </p>

<p>At a certain point, Job&rsquo;s friends come and try to offer him
some explanation, &ldquo;Look; you must not have taken care of the poor.  You must
have broken God&rsquo;s law somehow.  You must have done something wrong.&rdquo;  This is
what his friends told him, but this was not the truth.  The truth was that this
was the will of God.  </p>

<p>God decided with Job to allow a testing period where
everything would seemingly go wrong to see what would happen.  Satan was accusing
Job before God, that if God took everything away, if God took all of these
blessings away, then God would see Job&rsquo;s true colors.  </p>

<p>I guess that this is something for us to think about.  Here
we are and things do not seem like they have been going all that well for us
lately.  What is our response, though?  I know that Satan is no longer able to
enter into Heaven to continue to make accusations; but I guess for all intents
and purposes, the accusation still stands, &ldquo;Remove all of the good things, remove
the blessings from the people of God, and they will be disobedient just like
everybody else.  Just like all of the other people in the world, they will
curse God&rdquo;; but God, of course, will make sure that His people do not curse
Him.  </p>

<p>So we read again in Job 2:5 as Satan is before God and says: 
</p>

<p class="verse">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
and he will curse thee to thy face.  </p>

<p>Then look at verse 7, Job 2:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">So went Satan forth from the presence of JEHOVAH, and smote Job
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. And he took him a
potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.  </p>

<p>God actually does relate Job to us or to our day in the book
of James.  In James 5, He is talking about the end.  He says in James 5:7-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath
long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also
patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Grudge
not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge
standeth before the door. Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in
the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. Behold,
we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and
have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender
mercy.  </p>

<p>So here God is also telling us to be patient unto the coming
of the Lord and to look at Job.  He was patient in his afflictions, and yet we
have not been afflicted like Job.  </p>

<p>It is interesting how often God speaks of patience
concerning the end, like in Luke 21 where He really makes a statement that ties
this all up.  We read in Luke 21:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">In your patience possess ye your souls.  </p>

<p>He says, &ldquo;In your patience.&rdquo;  What is patience?  It is
waiting and it is waiting in a right way.  It is waiting on the Lord.  It is
waiting unto the coming of the Lord.  This is where our souls are possessed;
because if we lack patience, then we start thinking, &ldquo;Well, the Lord did not
come.  I know that there is all of this talk about October 21, but where is the
promise of His coming?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is interesting that God states this question, &ldquo;Where is the
promise of his coming?&rdquo;  The statement that was put out there was, &ldquo;The Bible
guarantees it!&rdquo;  The Bible guaranteed Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>So patience is extremely important when we are talking about
the coming of the Lord.  In many places, God connects the two.  </p>

<p>In Job 2, I wanted to look at Job&rsquo;s wife.  We go on to read
in Job 2:7-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">So went Satan forth from the presence of JEHOVAH, and smote Job
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. And he took him a
potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. Then said
his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 
</p>

<p>Was it pure coincidence that Satan just happened to be in
Heaven before God and saying these very words, that &ldquo;he will curse thee to thy
face&rdquo;?  Then on earth what do we find?  We find that the closest person to Job
was his wife, because all of his children were dead and his friends that show
up are not going be any help.  From the lips of the closest person to him,
which was his wife, comes exactly what Satan wanted.  </p>

<p>I do not know how this happened, except that Satan is a
spirit and that he &ldquo;worketh in the children of disobedience,&rdquo; according to
Ephesians 2.  If someone is not saved, they are open to this, like Judas.  In
the case of Judas, Satan entered into him; but in many cases, Satan does not
have to do this.  He can just stir the pot.  </p>

<p>Someone wakes up on the wrong side of the bed.  They are in
a grouchy mood and can be in a moment of weakness; and Job&rsquo;s wife had a big
moment of weakness.  We can just imagine what was going on in her mind as she
thought of all of these tragedies.  Her poor children; she bore each one of
them; she carried them nine months; she gave birth to them, and they all died
in a single day.  </p>

<p>So there is someone out there who takes these types of
opportunities and takes occasion to stir people up; and so she ends up saying
exactly what Satan wanted her to say.  But Job being a child of God says in Job
2:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>

<p>When things are not going well, this is really the test. 
This is the test of anything.  When things are going well, it is easy to be a
Christian.  Everybody is a Christian when things are going well.  It is when
things are hard that God tries us, and He tells us this.  He does not hide this
from us.  </p>

<p>Actually, I wanted to be careful about something because I
do not understand everything in the chapter of Daniel 11; but in Daniel 11, I
think that we find some very interesting verses that can help us understand
what is going on today.  Although, I think that we also have to be careful
because this is a difficult chapter.  It talks about &ldquo;the king of the south&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the king of the north&rdquo; and their battles.  It seems that both kings are
not godly.  They both speak lies.  But in Daniel, I think that we can connect
this to our present day when we look at Daniel 11:31:   </p>

<p class="verse">And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily <i>sacrifice, </i>and they
shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.  </p>

<p>The language of placing &ldquo;the abomination that maketh
desolate&rdquo; is similar to Matthew 24.  It says in Matthew 24:15-16:  </p>

<p class="verse">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let
him understand:) Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</p>

<p>This would be referring to today.  We understand correctly
that Satan&rsquo;s spirit was loosed during the great tribulation, during that
23-year period that is now over and that ended on May 21.  God loosed Satan on May 21, 198 8 and Satan took his seat as &ldquo;that man of sin.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Another way of putting this is that Satan was standing as
&ldquo;the abomination of desolation&hellip;in the holy place&rdquo; for 23 years.  At that point,
God opened up the command to come out of the church and to &ldquo;flee into the
mountains.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this connects Daniel 11 to our day, to the great
tribulation, and it says in Daniel 11:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do <i>exploits</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exploits&rdquo; is italicized, and so it just says &ldquo;and do,&rdquo; do
things, works.  </p>

<p>I think that we can see that this was exactly what happened
over the last year especially, as God&rsquo;s people were moved by the Spirit of
God.  He moves in us &ldquo;both to will and to do of <i>his </i>good pleasure.&rdquo;  He
moved in His people to go on Project Jonah overseas, to go on Project Caravan
in the United States, to go in the local neighborhoods day after day after
day.  This is actually an excellent word, because God&rsquo;s people did &ldquo;exploits.&rdquo; 
They did good works that God stirred them up to do at that time.  </p>

<p>One hundred percent, no question, this was the will of God. 
I do not have the slightest twinge that any of what we did was wrong, not one
bit.  Of course, this does not really mean anything, even though it does
personally to me.  I am somebody who is normally very sensitive when I say a
wrong thing or when I do a wrong thing.  When this happens, I feel terrible,
&ldquo;Oh, why did I say that?&rdquo;  I have a hard time shaking this and this is just how
I have been, and yet I do not have the slightest twinge that proclaiming May 21
as Judgment Day to the world was wrong in any way.  We were off in a couple of
the details.  When asked, yes; but this proclamation of &ldquo;May 21 &ndash; Judgment
Day!&rdquo; was true and correct, and it still is.  </p>

<p>So Daniel 11 is interesting because it speaks about &ldquo;the
abomination of desolation&rdquo; being placed, that God&rsquo;s people shall do &ldquo;exploits,&rdquo;
and then it says in Daniel 11:33:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who do we think of when you read this?  We think of Mr.
Camping and Family Radio.  We think of Family Radio, which has a worldwide
podium.  We think of the worldwide ministry of Family Radio.  </p>

<p>People just do not understand how incredible this ministry
is.  Family Radio has been teaching the end of the church age for a decade. 
They teach contrary to the churches on point after point after point.  This
means that they get zero support from any church in the world &ndash; zero.  They do
not receive their financial support.  They do not receive their word-of-mouth
support.  They do not receive any support from any church.  On the contrary,
there has been a big opposition from the churches towards the ministry of
Family Radio over the last decade.  </p>

<p>So, of course, this means that Family Radio&rsquo;s income has
declined.  Is this true?  No; Family Radio has had no problems financially as
God has taken care of things.  Does this mean that Family Radio sells a lot of
commercials and a lot of commercial airtime?  No; Family Radio does not sell
commercial airtime.  Did they have a lot of yard sales?  What about bake
sales?  </p>

<p>How did Family Radio get the money to run over 50 stations
in the United States as well as stations overseas and purchase airtime and have
shortwave facilities and satellite programming and television stations?  These
things cost millions upon millions of dollars.  Where did they get this from
when they were offending the church left and right by the truth of the Bible?  </p>

<p>We know that God has had to have been involved in this
ministry.  This is the only answer.  The Lord has had to be involved.  It is
His ministry.  God paved the way and God gave Family Radio a worldwide ministry
and a worldwide pulpit where they could declare these things to many.  </p>

<p>So Daniel 11:33 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many&hellip;  </p>

<p>We read in Ecclesiastes that &ldquo;a wise man's heart discerneth
both time and judgment,&rdquo; and Daniel 12 says that &ldquo;the wise shall understand.&rdquo; 
Everything about that period of time had to do with understanding the
Scripture.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,
days.  [<i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Note: Chris removed the italicized
word &ldquo;many&rdquo; before &ldquo;days.&rdquo;</span></i>]</p>

<p>So they that understand are going to fall.  Then it says in
verse 34, Daniel 11:34-35:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen [<i>helped</i>]
with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. And of them
of understanding shall fall&hellip;  [<i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Note: Chris
removed the italicized word &ldquo;some&rdquo; before &ldquo;of them.&rdquo;</span></i>]</p>

<p>This is the third time that He has said this.  It is not the
wicked who will fall, those who do not understand.  No; it is the wise who
understand, and those who understand will fall.  I counted three times that He
said this and the number three has to do with the purpose of God.  These are
the ones who will fall.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in verse 35, Daniel 11:35:  </p>

<p class="verse">And of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to
purge, and to make <i>them </i>white&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is a good reason for why we are still here, is it not? 
Those of understanding will fall, and here we read of God&rsquo;s purpose.  He said
three times that those of understanding will fall and then He gives three
reasons:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;to try them, and to purge, and to make <i>them </i>white&hellip;    </p>

<p>If you are halfway from here and the world, then you are
failing the trial.  If you are halfway from where you used to be in the church,
you are failing the trial.  </p>

<p>God is turning up the heat.  This has always been the case,
but He is telling us that He intends to try His people and to purge them and to
make them white.  Some will &ldquo;grow in grace.&rdquo;  God&rsquo;s people will &ldquo;grow in
grace.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>even </i>to the time of the end&hellip;  </p>

<p>So we are right.  This does have to do with our day.  The &ldquo;abomination
that maketh desolate&rdquo; has been set up, and here we see a reference to &ldquo;the time
of the end&rdquo;; and before this &ldquo;time of the end,&rdquo; &ldquo;them of understanding shall
fall.&rdquo;  Why?</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because <i>it is </i>yet for a time appointed.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that God says this.  It is as though we
were expecting an earlier time.  </p>

<p>I do not understand everything about Daniel 11; but in these
verses, they seem to indicate what we are thinking.  Yes; it surely feels hot
in the kitchen.  It does, because it is; and there is a purpose for this.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s perfect will.  We are not the ones who
determine the Gospel.  We are not the ones to say, &ldquo;Okay; enough!  Enough,
God!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There are some interesting verses in Luke 17.  It says in
Luke 17:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
meat? And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and
gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou
shalt eat and drink?  </p>

<p>The interesting thing about this passage is that the servant
has come out of the field after a long day.  Maybe he has been out there for
twelve hours.  He expects his work to be done.  But no; he is not done.  He has
one more thing to do.  &ldquo;Serve me,&rdquo; the master says.  </p>

<p>Maybe this is not exactly what we would have wanted.  We
want to relax.  We are tired.  We are weary.  But this is the Master&rsquo;s will. 
First, we did our work in the field.  We accomplished this, and the field is
the world.  Now, &ldquo;Serve me&hellip;and afterward thou shalt eat and drink&rdquo; &ndash;
forevermore &ndash; and so God is indicating that there is another stage that we were
not expecting.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Ephesians 6.  We read in Ephesians
6:11-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i>places.</i> Wherefore take
unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil
day&hellip;  </p>

<p>When is &ldquo;the evil day&rdquo;?  Every day is evil.  This is true
and I am not going to argue with you there.  Jacob said before Pharaoh, &ldquo;Few
and evil have the days of the years of my life been&rdquo;; but, in particular, there
is a very specific &ldquo;evil day&rdquo; that Ezekiel 7 tells us about.  We read in
Ezekiel 7:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
come. An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is
come.  </p>

<p>Is Judgment Day evil?  Yes; it is.  Was May 21 an evil day? 
When God shuts the door to Heaven, is this evil?  This is a very grievous thing. 
This is a very severe thing.  It is.  </p>

<p>Some people in the world do not think so.  A worldwide
earthquake is an evil thing and a very severe thing, but this is because the
world only sees in the natural realm.  They only understand physical tragedies
and not spiritual tragedies.  </p>

<p>This is just like when Adam and Eve were told, &ldquo;For in the
day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&rdquo;  They did not physically
die on that day, but they died spiritually; and all history attests that the
most evil thing imaginable was to die in your soul, to have a dead spirit, to
have this judgment come against mankind, even though this was not a physical
thing that happened on that very day.  Adam did not die until he was 930 years
of age.  </p>

<p>Going back to Ephesians 6, God is talking about the &ldquo;armour
of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the whole armour of God,&rdquo; not bits and pieces.  We know that if we
look at each piece, it all points to Christ, every bit of it.  It speaks of
&ldquo;the breastplate of righteousness,&rdquo; and He is our righteousness.  It speaks of
&ldquo;the shield of faith,&rdquo; and we are saved by the faith of Christ.  It speaks of
&ldquo;the helmet of salvation,&rdquo; and God has to put this on us because we cannot put
this on ourselves.  We are to have our &ldquo;loins girt about with truth,&rdquo; and
Christ tells us, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo;  Everything is
pointing to Christ.  We have to have &ldquo;the whole armour of God&rdquo; in order to be
protected.  </p>

<p>So we need to be a child of God in order to &ldquo;withstand in
the evil day,&rdquo; and Ephesians 6:13 goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and having done all, to stand.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that this says, &ldquo;having done all.&rdquo;  When
have we ever done it all?  Is this not an ongoing process each day as we live
the Christian life?  Today, we have to do the will of God.  Can we ever look at
ourselves and say that we have done it all?  Can we ever say, &ldquo;I have served
God and I have served Him completely and fully and finally.  I have done it
all&rdquo;?  No; we do not say this.  We just do not say this, except in one
instance.  </p>

<p>Does anybody have this feeling or is it just me who feels
that our job is done?  I mean, we no longer pass out tracts, we do not put out
signs, we do not put on shirts, nor do we wear hats.  Not only this, but we had
a very intense desire in this direction.  We wanted to get the Gospel out.  We
had to get the Gospel out because time was running out.  The day was coming,
and so we did &ndash; and &ldquo;exploits&rdquo; were done.  But nobody, of course, can take any
credit for this.  This was the will of God.  It was His Spirit moving in His people. 
</p>

<p>Now when I go to Wal-Mart and go through the checkout line,
I no longer hand the checker a tract.  I would almost always do this before.  I
would always feel bad if I did not do this, &ldquo;Oh, you dummy!  You left the
tracts in the car.&rdquo;  But I do not feel this way anymore.  I just walk through
the checkout line and have a nice conversation with the checker.  </p>

<p>Not only would I feel bad if I did not do this, but
sometimes the interaction between me and the checker would not go that well.  I
would think, &ldquo;Oh, this is a little bit of the Lord&rsquo;s chastisement, because I
did not do my job.  I did not give that person a tract.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This would cause me to be distracted in my mind and it was
uncomfortable; but this was to teach me that this is how God works; and so the
next time I went in there, I was to make sure that I had tracts in my back
pocket so that I would not have this on my mind and so that I could interact
with them.  Now I just have a nice chit-chat with the person and move on.  </p>

<p>Again, I have no guilt or no feelings that I should be doing
something more.  Why not?  The reason for this is because it is done.  What is
done?  What is done is the need to bring the Gospel message to the world while
the door is open.  While the door to Heaven was still open, yes, we were to get
the Gospel out there.  It was still the day of salvation.  </p>

<p>I remember on the evening of May 20<sup>th</sup> being at
Upper Darby Train Station and telling people, &ldquo;You only have until midnight or 1:00 A.M.&rdquo;  I was confused because of the Daylight Savings Time, but I told
them, &ldquo;You have until tonight.  What happens?  The door shuts.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what we told people.  Did we not tell people that
for this five-month period, there would be no salvation?  Not only this, we
told them that it was going to be as utterly and as horrible as anyone could
imagine.  There would be a great earthquake.  There would be no food, and so
on; and we did not have any problem telling people these things.  </p>

<p>Why is it that we suddenly have a problem telling people
that there is no salvation?  Is it because we are here?  Is this why?  We did
not have any problem telling them that there would be no salvation and utter
physical misery; but now, since we are here, what is the real motivation for
this?  What can we say?</p>

<p>May 21<sup>st</sup> was the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month of the Hebrew calendar.  This was the day that God shut the door.  This
was the day that the &ldquo;latter rain&rdquo; ceased to fall.  How can God save without
rain, the rain that is likened to His Word?  </p>

<p>This might be our own pride.  It might be our own preference
that we tell people that there is still salvation, rather than what the Bible
is actually teaching.  </p>

<p>So we read again in Ephesians 6:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and having done all, to stand.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Hebrews 10:35:  </p>

<p class="verse">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
recompense of reward.  </p>

<p>I hope that each of us still has this.  Do you still have
this?  The child of God will.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 10:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, we read of the need for patience.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that, after ye have done the will of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>We did it all.  We have done this.  Why does this say that
we need patience after doing this?  Can someone please explain what this
means?  What &ldquo;will of God&rdquo; would this be referring to?  </p>

<p>Here God is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise.  </p>

<p>So God is telling us that this is about salvation.  It has
to do with receiving this promise, and yet He is indicating that the will of
God is completed.  It is done.  It is finished.  </p>

<p>Remember what we read in 2 Corinthians 10:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when your obedience is fulfilled.  </p>

<p>This is in the past tense.  </p>

<p>So we have &ldquo;need of patience.&rdquo;  This is where all of this
patience comes in that we keep reading about in so many places in the Bible
when God is discussing the world.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 10:36 again:   </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience, that&hellip;ye might receive the promise. 
</p>

<p>This is nothing but everything that the child of God hopes
for: eternal life and the new heaven and new earth.  </p>

<p>This is just like Ephesians 6:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;having done all&hellip;  </p>

<p>And Hebrews 10:36 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;after ye have done the will of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is letting us know this.  </p>

<p>Number one, the whole world wants us to feel guilty.  This
is nothing new.  They have always wanted us to feel guilty.  We should have
felt guilty when we were at a ballpark on a Sunday handing out tracts.  There
must have been something wrong with us, because we were interrupting their
fun.  This is just the natural way that the world has reacted.  </p>

<p>Yet, for the believer, God wants us to know that we did His
will.  He held some things back from us for His own purposes, but we did His
will.  These things that we did were for His purpose.  </p>

<p>So, here again, it goes on to say in Hebrews 10:37:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.  </p>

<p>Do you see how this fits?  This does fit, does it not?  This
fits perfectly with what is going on today.  </p>

<p>There is one last thing to look at in Ephesians 6.  It says
again in Ephesians 6:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
able to withstand&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;withstand&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;resist&rdquo; in
some places.  It continues:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having
done all, to <span class="underline">stand</span>.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ephesians 6:14:    </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Stand</span> therefore, having your loins girt about with
truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>So God is indicating the need to stand, to stand with the
whole armor of God.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that He also says in Ephesians 6:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  Well, we are tasting a little bit of
this.  We are experiencing a little bit of this &ndash; constantly.  There are &ldquo;fiery
darts&rdquo; coming from individuals.  Remember, if anyone is unsaved, Satan can stir
them up to do these kinds of things.  This is why it is very important that we
stand and that we have &ldquo;the shield of faith,&rdquo; who is Christ, and His salvation. 
</p>

<p>Luke 21 is the parallel chapter to Matthew 24, and it has to
do with the great tribulation, the end of the world, and the little period of
time thereafter.  It says in Luke 21:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;unawares&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;sudden/suddenly&rdquo; in 1
Thessalonians 5:3.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 21:35-36:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be
accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to <span class="underline">stand</span>
before the Son of man.</p>

<p>This is the same word for &ldquo;stand&rdquo; that we see in Ephesians
6.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;To stand before the Son of man,&rdquo; we have to &ldquo;escape all
these things,&rdquo; all of the forces that are at work and that are coming against
the child of God.  There is this need to stand.  Of course, only God can make
us to stand and to keep us standing, and I am sure that He will.  His people
are not going to fall.  </p>

<p><b><span class="underline">Questions and Answers</span></b>:  </p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Hebrews
10:38?    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Hebrews 10:38:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the just shall live by faith: but if <i>any man </i>draw
back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  </p>

<p>This is a good verse.  We were just looking at the &ldquo;shield
of faith.&rdquo;  This is how we live.  </p>

<p>Faith is Christ.  He is our salvation.  He is our
protection.  He is our refuge.  He is our everything, and so we live by Him.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 10:38 is actually a quote from the book of Habakkuk
where it says, &ldquo;The just shall live by <span class="underline">his faith</span>&rdquo;; and so we are
definitely on the right track.  We look to Christ.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 10:38 also says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but if <i>any man </i>draw back&hellip;  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, some will.  This is just the nature of
things, but none will who are true children of God.  There is nowhere to go
back to.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>1<sup>st</sup> Question (continued):  </b>Would this
drawing back mean that we go back to the world?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>This is referring to going away from
Christ.  We have the example of Lot&rsquo;s wife.  She was fleeing the city and it
says that she &ldquo;looked back from behind him.&rdquo;  Historically, this meant from her
husband Lot; but, spiritually, the &ldquo;him&rdquo; is probably referring to Christ.  She
did not keep her eyes on Christ; she looked back from behind Him.  </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Matthew
24:13?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Matthew 24:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 
</p>

<p>It is, of course, a work to obey God and to stay in His path;
but God holds His people and He will give endurance.  Perseverance of the
saints is a correct theological doctrine.  This is a true teaching from the
Bible.  All of the elect persevere, but they only do so &ndash; and this is the
important thing &ndash; because of God&rsquo;s Spirit.  Because of His holding them, they
are steadfast and they are not going to fall away.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </b>What has changed in
relation to salvation at this time?  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>What I said recently was that, based
on the parable in Luke 11, there <span class="underline">might</span> be the possibility of virtually
no one being saved at this time, like there was during the 2300 days.  But this
was only an allowance for one or two.  We could not really put a number on
this.  It would have been very miniscule during that 2300 evening/morning
period.  </p>

<p>The thing to think about is that during the 2300
evening/mornings, the first part of the 23-year great tribulation which began
in 1988, virtually no one was being saved.  This means that the Bible possibly
allowed for someone somewhere to be saved.  </p>

<p>Could this have been an individual in the church?  No;
because God&rsquo;s Spirit left the church on May 21, 1988 for this whole time. 
Never again has anyone become saved in the church.  </p>

<p>So this individual who became saved during that time, if there
was one, would have been in the world, because God&rsquo;s Spirit was still working
in the world.  But now, we are looking at the door being shut on the whole
world.  It has already been shut on the church.  </p>

<p>The problem is then where could someone virtually be saved? 
Could somebody out in space become saved?  No; space is still part of this
creation.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>4<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Genesis
8:22?  Also, I no longer know what to tell people.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Genesis 8:22 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.  </p>

<p>We have to look at everything else in relation to this.  </p>

<p>But what we can still tell people is to pray that God have
mercy, because we do not know what happened.  For instance, God could have
saved an individual at 11:59 P.M. on May 20<sup>th</sup>.  He could have saved
someone at that time like He did with the thief on the cross.  This person
maybe prayed and maybe they did not.  Maybe they prayed a week earlier, but God
decided to save them at the last moment.  Actually, it does not matter whether
or not somebody prays, because it is God&rsquo;s work.  </p>

<p>So God saves that person.  Then that person woke up on this
last Saturday, but he sees no change, nor everyday since.  God saved that
person, and yet this is not evident.  This sometimes takes months, because this
is a process.  For some people, it may take longer for them to realize this;
however, we do not have that much time &ndash; but this is a process.  </p>

<p>So we can tell anyone to keep praying, to just keep
praying.  It could be that the Lord will make this evident in someone&rsquo;s life.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Could you look at Genesis
3:1?  There is no Hebrew word for Satan.  </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>We read in Genesis 3:1:    </p>

<p class="verse">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field
which JEHOVAH God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  </p>

<p>Alright; thank you.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </b>Question was in relation to
Job, but could not be heard.    </p>

<p><b>Chris</b><b>:  </b>Job is a good example.  Of course,
spiritually in some instances, we see that he was a picture of Christ.  But Job
was also a man and he, historically, did suffer the things that we read about;
and so he is a very excellent example for us.  </p>

<p>Alright; we are going to stop here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
