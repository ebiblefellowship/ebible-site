description: |
  We must consider the matter of salvation and judgment day.  
  Just as God brought judgment on the churches, he brought judgment on the whole world
  on May 21, 2011.  God used His people to bring to bring the message of salvation
  throughout the world and through that saved the last of His elect.
  We are now in a time of God's righteous judgment where this no more salvation.
