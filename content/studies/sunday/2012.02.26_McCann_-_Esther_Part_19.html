  A look at Esther 8:11-15. 
  The Jews are to stand and fight back on the day of Purim which shows that Purim is 
  spiritually representing Judgment Day: the only day in which God's people are to 
  permitted to do battle with their enemies in this way.

<p>We were in Luke 21 and we saw that Luke 21 is a chapter
dealing with the great tribulation and the end of the world.  It is a parallel
chapter to Matthew 24.  We were looking at verses, which is why we came here,
that pointed to God&rsquo;s people standing in the Day of Judgment.  We will just go
a little further down to Luke 21:34.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;unawares&rdquo; is the same word &ldquo;sudden&rdquo; that we read
about in 1 Thessalonians 5:3, and we will actually look at this verse a little later. 
</p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 21:35:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth.  </p>

<p>What is a snare?  It is a trap.  It usually something that
is hidden and that is not made very obvious.  It is something that is not put
out in plain view.  It is hidden.  If you are hunting, you hide a trap so that
the animal does not see it.  Before the animal knows it, they are caught and
they are ensnared.  </p>

<p>This is the word and the language that God is using to
describe the end of the world.  It is as a snare that comes on &ldquo;all of them,&rdquo;
on all of those who &ldquo;dwell on the face of the whole earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is a trap that God has planned for mankind at the
end of the world and I do not think that we have to wonder any longer about what
this trap is.  It is rather obvious that God warned the whole world, as this
Gospel of the Kingdom was preached &ldquo;in all the world for a witness unto all
nations; and then shall the end come.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God warned the whole world &ldquo;May 21 &ndash; Judgment Day!&rdquo; and the
whole world&rsquo;s ears perked up.  This message was put in the forefront of their
eyes and in their minds.  They could not avoid it.  For the first time in
history, this was the case.  I do not think that there has been anything that
could be said to be equal to this warning that went out into all the world
leading up to May 21 when so many people heard this message of Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>So all of the world was waiting.  They were waiting.  This
was such an event, as this was indicated by how troubled they were by it, that
they decided to have parties on that day.  They celebrated.  When things did
not happen as was expected, it was party time, &ldquo;Let us rejoice!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This was similar to the whole idea of the New Year.  Why
does the world celebrate New Year&rsquo;s and drink and rejoice?  Basically, they do
this because they are alive.  They are here another year.  In a sense, this is
like saying to God, &ldquo;I am still here.  You have not judged me yet,&rdquo; and this
was definitely what people were doing on May 21 when they woke up and it had
not happened as specified and as expected.  There was no physical and literal
earthquake.  There was no bringing up of the bodies out of the ground, and so
people celebrated.  </p>

<p>What happened after this?  What happened is that they began
to be at ease.  They began to go back to normal.  I think that this especially
relates to us.  This relates to those of us outside of the churches and
congregations who profess to be Christians, those who heard this warning.  </p>

<p>It is one thing to hear this leading up to that day and to
then put away your sins and to leave those things that you were doing that you
knew were wrong.  You did not want to get caught on Judgment Day.  You did not
want to get caught going into that Day doing certain things.  Depending on when
someone heard this message and when they were moved to behave accordingly &ndash;
maybe a year, maybe a month, maybe a day before May 21 &ndash; they told themselves
that they needed to get right with God.  But then it did not happen as they had
heard.  </p>

<p>So after taking a deep breath and maybe a sigh of relief,
some slowly and some not too slowly went right back to whatever it was that
they were doing, maybe even worse.  Now there is no threat even on the
horizon.  Yes, there was that other thing &ndash; the five months &ndash; and so some could
not quite relax just yet.  They could not take their ease just yet, because
there was still five months.  They still had until October 21 that had been
spoken of.  </p>

<p>As far as the world was concerned when May 21 did not
happen, not too many of them even bothered themselves with October 21; but it
was on the periphery.  We would hear a report now and then and people were
still kind of checking up on it, but it was those professed Christians, the
true believers, many of whom carried signs and wore hats and handed out a lot
of tracts who could not stop being interested in this, even though they might
have been doubting or at least beginning to doubt; but then October 21 did not
happen.  </p>

<p>So now, we have two dates that did not happen as we thought
&ndash; May 21 and October 21.  Now many think that this has all been a lie, that
this has all been untrue.  But here is the difference between God&rsquo;s people and
someone who is not really one of God&rsquo;s people.  God&rsquo;s people will be confused. 
Like anybody else, they can be perplexed and they can be troubled.  They can
not know what is going on, but they would not just take a study like the
timeline of history and decide that it just has to be thrown away, or they would
not then revert to the church&rsquo;s position and claim that no man knows the day or
hour.  </p>

<p>This has already been discussed how many times?  How much
time was spent on this leading up to May 21 as people called the Open Forum? 
They would claim, &ldquo;No man knows the day or hour&rdquo;: and again and again it was
shown, &ldquo;Well, what about this verse and what about that verse?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people realize that the Bible clearly does say that
God forewarns before He brings judgment and that the Biblical calendar of
history is correct.  It is based on the Bible.  It fits perfectly; and so some
people would ask, &ldquo;Yes; but what happened?&rdquo;  The believer would have no
answers, &ldquo;I do not know, but I know one thing.  I know that the Bible is true. 
I rechecked the information that I had learned and it is still true, and so we
wait on the Lord.  We are patiently waiting.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the trap that God has set.  This is the snare for
all of the world as to whether or not someone will just write this off.  Now
God has opened up more information that identifies that May 21 was Judgment Day
in the context of a timeline in the book of Esther.  </p>

<p>This is the interesting thing.  It is not like we are just
reaching out to Purim because it is the next available feast.  It is not that
we are just grabbing hold of this and saying, &ldquo;Christ did not come during this
feast, and so He must come during Purim.  If He does not come then, then He is
going to come at Passover.&rdquo;  This is, honestly, what some people have been
doing.  They have been trying to grab whatever they can, but this is not the reason
for why we are looking at Purim.  </p>

<p>We are looking at Purim because God put His finger on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, which is the equivalent date of May 21.  And
the amazing thing is that He did this within a timeline that leads to a date of
judgment in view in the book of Esther some ten months later.  </p>

<p>That was the first thing that we learned.  Actually, we have
learned many things from the book of Esther.  We learned about Esther&rsquo;s name,
which was Hadassah, and it just so happens that this name was found in
Zechariah 1 in the very passage that is dealing with five months after a period
of 23 days.  Then we learned that Haman was killed on the 17<sup>th</sup> day
of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month and that Mordecai was exalted.  But we also learned
that God has doubled the judgment.  </p>

<p>Just think about this.  What had to take place for the
doubling to fit?  We cannot double 153 days.  That will not fit anything.  We
cannot double 150 days.  That will also not fit anything.  But there is one
date &ndash; Tishri 17 &ndash; if we have that date as the end of the five months, the
space of 2/17 to 7/17, only this date can be doubled and then have the second
portion of it land on the last day of the feast of Purim ten months later. 
This is the only date that fits and this is from the Bible.  God gives the date
of Tishri 17 in Genesis 8:4.  </p>

<p>So God has set this up as a great trial of faith &ndash; your
faith, my faith, everyone&rsquo;s faith, especially the faith of those outside of the
churches and congregations.  This is a period of extreme trial, like we read
about in 1 Corinthians 3, to try to see what sort of work we are made of.  </p>

<p>Every man&rsquo;s work is to be tried to make manifest what is in
us.  Is it the faith of Christ?  If it is, it will, therefore, be brought forth
as &ldquo;gold, silver, precious stones.&rdquo;  The fire does not harm &ldquo;gold, silver,
precious stones&rdquo;; it purifies them.  If it is the faith of &ldquo;wood, hay,
stubble,&rdquo; then it will be burned up; and this day will tell this, this Judgment
Day, this &ldquo;fiery trial,&rdquo; this period in which God has set a snare for all of
the world.  </p>

<p>Going back to Luke 21, we read in Luke 21:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch ye therefore, and pray always&hellip;   </p>

<p>Notice that He tells us to &ldquo;pray always,&rdquo; and this includes
now.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.  </p>

<p>Luke 21 is dealing with the great tribulation and the end of
the world.  Finally at the end of this test, what is it that we want to do at
the very end of everything?  We want to stand.  </p>

<p>Mordecai was writing to the Jews in the king&rsquo;s name and
sealing it with the king&rsquo;s ring.  He had granted the Jews &ldquo;to stand for their
life&rdquo;; and God tells us that &ldquo;having done all, to stand.&rdquo;  Then He says, &ldquo;Stand
therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is what it means to &ldquo;endure unto the end,&rdquo; to stand
in His faith, trusting God and trusting His Word.  And we do this in the face
of what kind of opposition?  Well, it is the opposition of the whole world, the
whole church, maybe our whole families, and maybe everyone or many who stood
with us prior to May 21.  </p>

<p>Do you see how God is testing?  Who is it that causes you to
stand?  Who is it that enables the believer, the child of God, to stand?  Is it
what others think?  Is it what others believe?  Is it the pressure of your
peers?  No; it is God alone, and so He is indicating that His people will stand;
and this is what we want to do, which is only by God&rsquo;s grace.  </p>

<p>Let us go to one other place.  We read in Malachi 3:2-3, it
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
when he appeareth? for he <i>is </i>like a refiner's fire, and like fullers'
soap: And he shall sit <i>as </i>a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer
unto JEHOVAH an offering in righteousness.  </p>

<p>We can see here how God is relating the fires of
purification, of being tried like we read in 1 Corinthians 3, to the whole idea
of standing.  Who will stand?  </p>

<p>This is such an intense flame.  This is really a burning
heat that we have all felt.  It is affliction.  It is tribulation.  It is a
severe trial of faith; and so this is why the question is asked, &ldquo;Who shall
stand when he appeareth?&rdquo;  This is a similar question to what we will see a
little later in the Gospel of Luke.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Esther 8.  It says in Esther 8:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherein the king granted the Jews which <i>were </i>in every
city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to
slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, <i>both </i>little ones and women, and <i>to take </i>the
spoil of them for a prey,  </p>

<p>So we read here that we are to stand and fight.  </p>

<p>I was recently looking at the Union&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;Stand up! 
Fight back!&rdquo;  This is basically what we are reading here in Esther where God is
saying to His people:  </p>

<p class="verse">...stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to
perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is telling us to kill our enemies, to slay our enemies,
but we have to ask a question.  Historically, we understand this situation.  We
understand that the Jews were going to die and that, therefore, the only way
out of this was to grant them the ability to fight back and to show that the
power of the government or of the kingdom was behind them and that Mordecai,
the great ruler next to Ahasuerus, was for them.  Then all of the authorities
of the provinces supported the Jews and helped them so that they could finally
kill all of their enemies.  We do not read of one Jew who was harmed or killed
on the day of Purim.  </p>

<p>Historically, we can understand why this law was made or
that the decree was given telling the Jews to fight back.  They needed to do
this.  This was necessary because of the earlier law that said that they were
to die.  But, spiritually, how can we understand this, since Mordecai is a type
of Christ and the Jews represent God&rsquo;s elect?  </p>

<p>We can understand him telling them to stand for their lives,
but he is also telling them to fight back.  They were told to stand and to
fight back, and we are a little surprised because it is shocking to hear this. 
</p>

<p>Look at Esther 8:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province <i>was </i>published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Vengeance <i>is </i>mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.&rdquo; 
Vengeance is not ours.  He does not allow us the luxury, if we could call it
that, of being wrathful or angry to someone who has wronged us.  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us, &ldquo;Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
cheek, turn to him the other also.&rdquo;  It does not tell us to take them on and to
fight and to do battle.  Spiritually, this command is not given.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at a couple of verses, one in the Old
Testament.  Leviticus 19:18 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH. 
</p>

<p>Here is the Law of God in the Old Testament and it tells us
that we shall not avenge.  </p>

<p>In the New Testament, let us go to Romans 12.  Romans
12:18-21 instructs us:  </p>

<p class="verse">If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <i>rather </i>give place
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <i>is </i>mine; I will repay, saith
the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.  </p>

<p>This does not say that if our enemy hunger that we should
then slay him.  This does not give us that kind of instruction.  If even our
enemy is in need, we should try to help with that need.  Of course, this is
spiritually referring to the Gospel, as there is the kingdom of Satan that is
the enemy of the Kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>This is what God&rsquo;s people do.  We share the Gospel.  When we
were handing out tracts everywhere, many of those people were enemies of God
and, therefore, enemies of us because we are citizens of God&rsquo;s Kingdom; and
this is what God would have us to do.  </p>

<p>Can anyone think of a place in the Bible that allows God&rsquo;s
people, the elect, to bring vengeance and to destroy their enemies?  No; not in
this life.  In any case and in any situation, we are not to avenge ourselves, &ldquo;but
<i>rather </i>give place unto wrath.&rdquo;  We are to turn it over to God.  There is
a saying that goes, &ldquo;Talk about me all you please and I will talk about you on
my knees.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So someone can speak badly of us, and yet our response is
not to fight.  We pray.  We pray for the person.  We pray for the situation,
and this has always been the position of God&rsquo;s people.  This is what God would
have us to do.  Never are we allowed to take vengeance but for one exception &ndash;
and this is the only exception &ndash; except for the end of the world.  That is the
only exception, because that is the place for wrath.  God says, &ldquo;Give place
unto wrath.&rdquo;  We are to give place for the &ldquo;day of vengeance.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is at that time when He will take vengeance on His
adversaries or on His enemies and bring judgment and destroy them.  We are with
Him.  Since all of God&rsquo;s people are with Him, then, in a sense, we likewise are
taking vengeance on our enemies.  They are enemies of God and His Kingdom, and
we are citizens of that Kingdom; therefore, they are our enemies.  That is the
only exception to the idea.  </p>

<p>So, spiritually, when we read this idea regarding Purim that
this is a &ldquo;day of vengeance,&rdquo; that this is a day for the Jews to avenge
themselves of their enemies, this is telling us that this is pointing to
Judgment Day.  Outside of the timelines or anything else, this is another way
of indicating, just by the text itself, that the date of Purim is pointing to
the end, to the time when God will finally destroy all of the enemies of His
Kingdom.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Luke 18.  We probably discussed this in a
question and answer session, but I do not think that we have discussed this
during a Bible study, but this is a parable that Jesus gives of a widow woman
that fits our day.  This is a parable that is really speaking to us today.  It
says in Luke 18:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint;  </p>

<p>This is just like we read in Luke 21 where it said that we
are to &ldquo;pray always,&rdquo; always keep praying.  </p>

<p>Why does this encouragement and exhortation fit us so well
today?  It is because there is such temptation to stop due to our weariness,
due just to the trials that we are facing, due to the uncertainty of things, to
our perplexity as we wonder what is going on.  It is very easy for us to get
into our minds and even into a habit to just stop praying, even though we
should not stop.  God is telling us not to do this.  We:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ought always to pray, and not to faint;  </p>

<p>Luke 18:2-3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who does a &ldquo;widow&rdquo; typify?  She typifies the elect, the true
believers, and so this widow woman typifies the elect.  Later on in this
parable, this will be confirmed.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.  </p>

<p>So here is a widow woman going to an unjust judge who did
not care about God.  When it says that he &ldquo;feared not God,&rdquo; this means that he
had no concern for the Law of God.  He did not operate according to the laws of
the Bible, because this is really what the fear of God is.  To have the fear of
God means that we want to do the will of God as we read it in the Bible.  </p>

<p>This judge did not care about this and it also says that he
&ldquo;neither regarded man.&rdquo;  He did not care what the laws of man were either nor
the opinion of man.  Yet the widow woman had to go to him.  He was the judge
who was in her province or in her district.  He was probably the only one whom
she could go to.  Maybe if she had preference, she would have picked another
one; but she probably had no other option.  </p>

<p>So she went saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.  </p>

<p>Since she was going to a judge, this was probably due to
some sort of legal matter.  Maybe someone was trying to take her home.  We do
not know the whole situation, but we do know that a widow woman, someone who
typifies the elect, was going to a judge; and even though he was an unjust
judge, he would be picturing God; and she is making request for vengeance:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.  </p>

<p>This reminds us of what we are reading in Esther 8 when the
command is given to the Jews to avenge themselves.  We saw that this command
can only apply to the end of the world.  </p>

<p>The widow woman is asking for vengeance; and since the
command to the Jews to avenge in Esther only has application to the end of the
world, the widow woman in Luke 18 is basically asking God to come, &ldquo;Come, Lord
Jesus; come quickly.&rdquo;  This is because this is the only time when God will
avenge His people or when the elect will actively seek God&rsquo;s vengeance.  This
is because when we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, it is my desire that You come and that
You come quickly,&rdquo; what is going to happen when God comes?  It will be the &ldquo;day
of vengeance.&rdquo;  That will be the day of destruction, the day when all of the
enemies of God will be slain.  </p>

<p>So even though this is not in our thoughts and even though
this is not why we are beseeching the Lord to come, since this is just our
desire for Him to complete His salvation for us and for Him to create a new
Heaven and a new earth and to fulfill His promise; yet, in actuality, it works
out that when He responds to that prayer, He comes and brings judgment and
destroys all of the enemies of His Kingdom.  So, therefore, when believers are
praying, &ldquo;Come Lord Jesus,&rdquo; they are praying, &ldquo;Avenge me of mine enemies.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We were looking to May 21 for Christ&rsquo;s coming.  What was to
happen?  We thought that it would be Judgment Day, five months of torment, and
the &ldquo;day of vengeance&rdquo; all at the same time.  So as we were beseeching the Lord
to come, we were also basically &ndash; even though this is unstated &ndash; praying that
God would avenge us of our enemies.  Then again in October, people were looking
forward to that date, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus&rdquo;; once again saying the same thing in
an unspoken manner, &ldquo;Come and avenge us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So here the widow woman is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.  </p>

<p>God is encouraging us through her:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;  </p>

<p>He is encouraging us to continue to pray as He gives us this
example of a woman who is continually praying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.   </p>

<p>This was her request to this unjust judge again and again
and again.  She would not stop:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.   </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 18:4-5: </p>

<p class="verse">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow
troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 18:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.  </p>

<p>Hear what the Lord is saying.  We are praying and we are
expecting Him to come.  This did not happen as we thought.  Again, we expected
Him to come and things did not happen as we thought they would.  Therefore, is
it time to pack it in?  Is it time to give up the whole idea?  Is it time to
get back to other things and to leave this whole issue of date setting alone
and get back to things that we understand and we know?  </p>

<p>That is not what God is encouraging us to do through this
parable and through this widow woman.  She kept coming to him and asking:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Avenge me of mine adversary.   </p>

<p>This is basically the equivalent statement of saying, &ldquo;Come,
Lord Jesus.  Come.  Come.&rdquo;  Even if people were telling her not to desire this
and not to pray for this, she cannot help it and only continues.  </p>

<p>Can any true believer help this?  Is this not always the
case for a child of God?  Have we not always wanted Him to come?  But people do
not understand this.  They think that we might hate the world or that we just
want to escape this world, but it has nothing to do with that.  </p>

<p>This is a desire that God has placed within the heart of an
elect person, because he has a new heart and a new spirit.  We hate sin and yet
we still have the body of sin.  We still live in a world of sin.  The whole
universe is corrupted by sin.  So, naturally, we want God to come and to set it
right.  We want Him to perfect us and to perfect a new Heaven and new earth. 
This will be the fulfillment of our desire.  Salvation is not complete while we
are in this world.  It is not complete until we receive a new resurrected
body.  This is our desire.  </p>

<p>Would anyone say to someone in the days when God was still
saving, &ldquo;Do not desire salvation; do not desire a new heart&rdquo;?  Well, that would
be foolish.  Of course, we would desire a new heart, and the true believer
desires a new body.  What is the difference since it is all part of God&rsquo;s
salvation?  </p>

<p>Here in Luke 18, the unjust judge finally says that he will
avenge the widow woman because she keeps coming to him.  He is getting annoyed
and tired, and so he is going to grant her request.  </p>

<p>So it says again in Luke 18:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Luke 18:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall not God avenge his own elect&hellip;    </p>

<p>Do you see how He relates the widow woman to the elect and
He, Himself, to the position of the judge who is hearing her request?  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with them?  </p>

<p>We are in a time when the Bible says that there is still day
and night.  There is no rest day and night because we are in the period of
judgment and there is no salvation day or night, but there are still
timekeepers in the sky.  There are still 24-hour periods, and day and night
God&rsquo;s people are crying.  But what are they crying?  </p>

<p>This is definitely referring to the elect:  </p>

<p class="verse">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
unto him, though he bear long with them?  </p>

<p>They are crying for vengeance.  This is because Christ will
execute vengeance when He comes.  We just want Him to come, and yet God is
relating this prayer and that desire to the &ldquo;day of vengeance&rdquo; when He will
finally pour out His wrath to the uttermost and completely destroy all of the
unsaved or all of the enemies of His Kingdom.  </p>

<p>Then Luke 18:8 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when
the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?  </p>

<p>Do you see how this is related to the end of the world and
to looking for Christ&rsquo;s coming?  When He cometh, &ldquo;shall he find faith on the
earth?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why this question?  It is because who shall stand?  On the
day of this refining fire, who is going to stand?  Nobody by their own
strength, &ldquo;If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?&rdquo; 
None of us.  Only the elect will stand, because God will force us, He will
cause us, He will make us, and He will enable us to stand the heat of the fire,
this &ldquo;fiery trial&rdquo; of faith.  </p>

<p>This is why the question is finally asked:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on
the earth?  </p>

<p>What is &ldquo;faith&rdquo;?  The Bible tells us that faith is &ldquo;the
substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So the people of God continue to trust Him and to believe. 
God&rsquo;s people believed that judgment was on the churches, even though they could
not see it.  We could never see this.  We never saw the stones tumbled down so
that one stone was not left upon another.  We never saw that, yet we know that
judgment began at the house of God and that God left the churches without
salvation back in 1988, and yet we never saw a thing.  We never saw the Holy
Spirit leave.  We never saw Satan enter in.  We never saw these things and yet
we believed them by faith, because God has given us this understanding of His
Word.  </p>

<p>Likewise, Judgment Day was May 21 even though we did not see
a worldwide earthquake and even though we did not literally see the ground open
and the bodies come up.  Even though we did not see these things, we are
learning them in the Bible and through faith we understand and we trust what
God has done.  </p>

<p>This is basically the similar judgment that came on the
church.  It is almost identical.  God tried the church for 23 years before
Judgment Day and now He is trying the world for the ten months leading up to
the final end.  </p>

<p>Let us turn back to Esther 8.  I just want to read verse 12
to point something out.  Esther 8:12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, <i>namely, </i>upon
the thirteenth <i>day </i>of the twelfth month, which <i>is </i>the month Adar. 
</p>

<p>This date has not changed anywhere in the book of Esther. 
This date has always been the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month
that was chosen by lot, the day of destruction.  This is because the number 12
points to fullness and the number 13 points to the end of the world; and so in
the fullness of time, as the month and day relate to time, God will bring the
end of the world.  </p>

<p>This date had not changed from the earlier message that was
sent out to the provinces and it does not change with the second decree that is
sent out to the provinces.  This date stayed the same.  We just did not have
all of the information earlier.  When we were sharing Judgment Day, we were
correct about that date of May 21, but we did not know the duration or how long
Judgment Day would be.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Esther 8:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province
<i>was </i>published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against
that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<i> So </i>the posts that rode
upon mules <i>and </i>camels went out, being hastened and <span class="underline">pressed on</span> by
the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.  </p>

<p>The decree was given at Shushan, and Shushan identifies with
Jesus as it is the word for &ldquo;lily&rdquo; and Jesus is the &ldquo;lily of the valleys.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So the decree is given in Christ or in the Word of God or in
God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and the posts carry the message.  They hastened and pressed on. 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;pressed on&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;hastened&rdquo; in Esther
3:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">The posts went out, being <span class="underline">hastened</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word that was translated &ldquo;pressed on&rdquo; in
Esther 8:14.  </p>

<p>Esther 3:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
and the decree was given in Shushan the palace&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see any similarity with this verse and with Esther
8:14?  They are very similar, but this is information of sharing Judgment Day
with the world when God was still saving, because this is prior to the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month in the book of Esther.  God gave a command and
&ldquo;great <i>was </i>the company of those that published <i>it.</i>&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When God gives a commandment, His people run the way of His
commandment.  Does it matter if there is or is not salvation?  What kind of
postmen or postwomen would you be if when the king gave a decree you first had
to inspect it and read it over and say, &ldquo;I like this decree.  This decree is
worthy of me getting on my horse or on my mule and galloping as fast as I can
to carry this message.  I am going to go all out for this decree&rdquo;?  But later
on when you receive another decree &ndash; and we know that the timeline is telling
us that this is after May 21 and after the door is shut when there is no
salvation &ndash; now the postman inspects the information and decides that he does
not like it.  </p>

<p>Why should we press on?  Why should we hasten this matter? 
I have heard many people ask this.  Why do we want to share information about
Purim since God is not saving anyway?  </p>

<p>Well, who are we?  Who are we?  We often lose sight of who
we are.  We are the doorkeeper.  We do not determine if the door is open or
shut.  We just open or shut it according to the One who command us.  We are the
messenger.  We do not write the message.  All we are is the one who receives it
and then we run with it.  </p>

<p>We are the postmen.  We are given the decree from the King
that is sealed with the King&rsquo;s ring, it is stated in His name, we get on our
animal and we go with it and we do not question it.  We do not question it.  </p>

<p>Obviously, for King Ahasuerus, Esther, and Mordecai the
second decree is just as important as the first decree was, maybe more so, even
though it is all taken care of.  Esther has already gone into the king.  She
had already made request.  The Jews had already found favor in his sight.  </p>

<p>So what is the urgency?  The urgency, as we spiritually
carry this over, is that God is commanding us to share this information.  It is
a commandment and that is all that we need to know.  </p>

<p>If God commands that Sunday is His Holy Day, and He does,
then do we delay to observe this?  Do we delay to keep Sunday as His Holy Day? 
We might, but we should quickly and right away start to change what we are
doing on Sunday &ndash; or whatever God&rsquo;s Law is &ndash; because it is God&rsquo;s Law and He is
the great King.  He tells us what to do and we do it.  </p>

<p>So here, the posts do not even inspect it.  The letter is
sealed.  They just carry the news and they go forth as fast as they can.  There
is nothing here that would indicate that they slacked or delayed or failed in
any way to carry this message the same way that the postmen carried this
message earlier when it was news of Judgment Day approaching.  </p>

<p>Now this news of complete deliverance for the Jews is
carried to all of the same places to the world.  Then it says in Esther 8:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment
of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.  </p>

<p>Again, Shushan is the word &ldquo;lily.&rdquo;  So the city of Christ
&ldquo;rejoiced and was glad&rdquo; at the news.  They were glad.  </p>

<p>I do not understand if someone is troubled by this.  I do
not understand if someone does not like this, because this was not the reaction
of the people of God in the book of Esther.  This news is all good.  It is all
positive.  </p>

<p>There was not a Jew, not a single Jew, not one who heard the
message of Purim, this second letter when the decree was given that they could
stand for their life, who received this in a manner indicating that they did
not like this.  It was all wonderful news, it was a great blessing, and it was
something that caused tremendous rejoicing in every Jewish home with every Jewish
person, with all of the elect.  </p>

<p>This is for everyone who has been crying to God day and
night, &ldquo;Avenge me of mine adversary,&rdquo; because they have basically been praying
to God, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, come; come quickly.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, when they hear that Christ is coming and that He is
fulfilling His Word, when they hear that there is still a way that May 21 is
true, that the five months is true, and that God has just simply doubled this, that
He has laid a snare and a trap for all of the world and that He will spring
this trap on the last day of the feast of Purim, well then, this is news that
will encourage any person who is one of His people.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
