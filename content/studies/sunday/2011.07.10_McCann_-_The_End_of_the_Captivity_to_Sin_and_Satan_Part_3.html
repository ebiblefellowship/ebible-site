<p>We were talking about a great earthquake last Sunday.  We
went to Acts 16.  I would like to go back to this to talk about this some more
to see how this relates to God&rsquo;s salvation plan.  I also want to do this to
honestly answer the question that some have as to whether or not this is an
excuse to say that May 21 was spiritually Judgment Day, that on May 21 there was
spiritually a great earthquake.  Let us honestly take a look at this and see. 
Is this an excuse or is this what the Bible is teaching?  </p>

<p>First, in Acts 16:25-26, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a <span class="underline">great earthquake</span>,
so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</p>

<p>What we are interested in is that this was at midnight, because this is a significant time in the Bible.  We are also interested in this
being &ldquo;a great earthquake.&rdquo;  These are the two Greek words <i>megas seismos</i>. 
We hear of mega-deals everywhere; everybody has a mega-deal, a great deal.  We
still use this word.  It comes from the Greek and it represents something that
is great, huge, big, as in the great tribulation, which is <i>megas thlipsis</i>. 
The word &ldquo;great&rdquo; is the word <i>megas</i>, then we read of a <i>seismos</i>. 
How do they measure earthquakes today?  The instrument that is used to measure
earthquakes is called a seismograph.  This measures the shaking of the earth. 
This comes from the Greek word <i>seismos</i> for &ldquo;earthquake.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So there was a great earthquake and this earthquake must
have destroyed the whole city of Philippi.  Is this true?  No; it does not say
that it did this.  What did this great earthquake do?  It must have destroyed
the whole prison, because we read that it shook the foundations of the prison. 
Certainly, the whole building came collapsing down.  Is this true?  No; it did
not do this either.  It only opened all of the prison doors and all of the
shackles or bands of the prisoners who were shackled.  </p>

<p>Paul and Silas were shackled.  They were in the inner
prison.  The prison keeper had been given the charge to make sure that these
prisoners were secured, and so he did shackle them.  This is much like Joseph
whom the Bible says, &ldquo;Whose feet they hurt with fetters&rdquo;; because when he was
in prison, he also had his feet in shackles.  </p>

<p>So this earthquake was isolated to the prison&rsquo;s
foundations.  It did not destroy the prison at all.  It only opened up the
prison doors and the shackles.  This is all that it did, and it was &ldquo;a great
earthquake.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This &ldquo;great earthquake&rdquo; relates to Revelation 6, which is related
to May 21.  These are the same two words.  We read in Revelation 6:12-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
was a <span class="underline">great earthquake</span> [<i>megas seismos</i>]; and the sun became black
as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven
fell unto the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to talk about the fear of mankind and how
they are crying for the rocks and the mountains to cover them.  We thought that
all of this language would be literal, and we identified this great earthquake
with May 21 because God does.  This is when the &ldquo;sun became black,&rdquo; the &ldquo;moon
became as blood,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stars of heaven fell.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 24:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days&hellip;  </p>

<p>When did the tribulation end?  After 23 years or 8400 days
on May 21, the tribulation ended.  What happened?  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  </p>

<p>Revelation 6:14 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And the heaven departed as a scroll&hellip;  </p>

<p>So this affected the sun, moon, and stars and it mentions
&ldquo;the heaven,&rdquo; just like Matthew 24:29 says that &ldquo;immediately after the
tribulation,&rdquo; there is darkness.  </p>

<p>We understood that this was spiritual.  We understood prior
to May 21 that what was happening to the heavens was not going to be literal,
because there had to be five months of time.  This was just God using language
explaining the removal of the Gospel lights.  </p>

<p>I hope that you remember this.  What we were saying was that
the great earthquake would be physical, and they are actually linked together
in Revelation 6.  We were saying that one portion of this, the earthquake,
would be physical but we understood the rest spiritually.  </p>

<p>Of course, we were wrong.  In hindsight, we should have just
realized, since this was all in the same verse, that the great earthquake was
going to be spiritual, too.  </p>

<p>Does anybody feel bad about this?  I do not feel bad about
this.  Really; I said this before.  I do not have a twinge of guilt about
saying that there would be a great earthquake.  Why not?  This is just like how
I do not feel bad about teaching eternal damnation for many years, which I
did.  </p>

<p>I remember one guy said something to me that, at the time, I
took as a compliment.  He said, &ldquo;You know, I like your preaching.  You talk
about hell all of the time.&rdquo;  This was because I used to think that if I was to
be faithful, I had to talk about hell.  But then I learned that in the Bible,
God does not teach that there is an eternal place of hell.  </p>

<p>Once I learned this and if I then would have taught this, I
would have had a bad conscience about this.  But I do not have a bad conscience
about any of the teachings that I taught before, because I taught them in all
good conscience.  </p>

<p>This is just like the Apostle Paul felt.  Look up the word
&ldquo;conscience.&rdquo;  We will just go to a couple verses, like Acts 23:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men <i>and </i>brethren,
I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.  </p>

<p>They did not like this, because we read next in Acts 23:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth.  </p>

<p>How dare Paul say this!  It would have been fine if Paul had
been talking about his days as a zealot, like when he stood by as Stephen was
being stoned, or when he went to hail men and women to prison.  If he had been
referring to having a good conscience in any of this, they would have been
fine; but they knew that he was also talking about his transformation, which
was God&rsquo;s transformation of taking him from being a Pharisee to being like
those whom Paul had been persecuting, into a Christian.  This is why Ananias
commanded to smite him.  Then Paul said to him, &ldquo;God shall smite thee, <i>thou </i>whited
wall.&rdquo;  But then Paul realized that Ananias was the high priest and Paul knew
that he should not &ldquo;speak evil of the ruler of thy people.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Yet Paul says that he lived &ldquo;in all good conscience,&rdquo; and
Paul is talking about his days as a Pharisee as well as his life as a
Christian.  This is because, for all that he knew, he was serving God honestly,
which he did.  Remember that it was God who had to open up his eyes.  Paul was
on the road to Damascus.  He was going to gather Christians and to bring them
back to Jerusalem to compel them to blaspheme and to throw them into prison. 
But God came and, in a great way, shined a light from Heaven, a brilliant
light.  Paul was then blinded for a period of time, and then God opened his
eyes.  It was then that Paul understood that he had been persecuting Christ in
going after the people of God, in going after the Christians.  </p>

<p>So I do not have any type of bad conscience about telling
the world that May 21 was Judgment Day or anything that we said about this. 
This is because, number one, it was Judgment Day.  Number two, I do not have a
bad conscience about telling people that there would be a great earthquake,
because there was.  The only thing that we were off on was the physical part of
one aspect of this.  I do not have a bad conscience about this.  None of us
should, and I am sure that the true believers do not, because God was in
control of this.  He was in complete control, 100% control.  </p>

<p>Think about what people want from a child of God, &ldquo;You
should have known.&rdquo;  How should we have known?  We will get into this a little
bit later.  </p>

<p>In Matthew 16, Jesus mentions leaven.  Then all of the
disciples, who were true believers, started wondering, &ldquo;Why is He telling us
about leaven?  He is warning us, &lsquo;Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and of the Sadducees.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Then they say, &ldquo;<i>It is </i>because we have
taken no bread.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They were thinking on the natural and physical level, and
these were true believers.  Then Jesus asked them, &ldquo;Do ye not yet understand?&rdquo; 
Then He chided and rebuked them, &ldquo;Neither remember the five loaves of the five
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?&rdquo;  Then it goes on to say that the
disciples understood, &ldquo;Then understood they how that he bade <i>them </i>not
beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the
Sadducees.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Actually, Jesus never told them that He was referring to
doctrine.  He asked them, &ldquo;Do ye not yet understand?&rdquo;  This made them think a
little bit more about other things that He had done; in other words, other
Scripture.  It was then that they understood.  He never actually corrected them
and said, &ldquo;Look; leaven equals doctrine.&rdquo;  They had to figure this out.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what God has done with the Bible.  Again, we
will look at this, hopefully, a little later.  For now, we are looking at a
prison.  What does the Bible say about prison/prisoners?  </p>

<p>We read in Isaiah 42:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">I JEHOVAH have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a
light of the Gentiles;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of Christ.  It continues in Isaiah 42:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, <i>and </i>them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. </p>

<p>God is saying that He is going to bring out the prisoners
from the prison.  He is not saying when, but He is saying that He is going to
bring them out.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 61.  We read in Isaiah 61:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">The spirit of the Lord JEHOVAH <i>is </i>upon me; because
JEHOVAH hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me
to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
opening of the prison to <i>them that are </i>bound; To proclaim the acceptable
year of JEHOVAH, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that
mourn;  </p>

<p>This is what God is really looking towards, which is the
coming Messiah or when Christ would come.  Christ is the One who is actually
speaking here.  We know this because in Luke 4, Jesus quotes this passage from
Isaiah.  We read in Luke 4:16-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for
to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And
when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The
Spirit of the Lord <i>is </i>upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the
gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at
liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And
he closed the book, and he gave <i>it </i>again to the minister, and sat down.
And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And
he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;This day,&rdquo; which was in 33 A.D., Christ read this verse
that talked about preaching &ldquo;deliverance to the captives&rdquo; and &ldquo;the acceptable
year of the Lord.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How are we to understand this?  We understand this when we
remember the Jubilee.  The Jubilee was a year.  The &ldquo;acceptable year&rdquo; was
really another way or a synonym for expressing the Jubilee year.  </p>

<p>What did this have to do with Christ?  Christ was born in 7
B.C., which was a Jubilee year.  In His coming, and especially later in His
ministry, He was to fulfill the promise of the Jubilee, which would be to set
the captives free.  This is exactly what God did.  </p>

<p>So the Gospel went out into all the world starting from the
birth of Christ in 7 B.C. in the Jubilee year, then through the work that He
did during his three a half years of ministry, then throughout the New Testament
Era, until May 21, 1988.  This was basically the first Jubilee period.  Then
God ended the church age and He ended this Jubilee.  Maybe we will look at this
a little later, because there are some similarities with this prison house in
Acts 16 and the Jubilee.  </p>

<p>So here Jesus is quoting Isaiah 61 and saying:</p>

<p class="verse">This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.  </p>

<p>This is because He came to set the captives free.  </p>

<p>Look at 2 Timothy 2.  I will start in verse 24 because these
are good verses for all of us.  We all need reminders of this; I know that I
do. We read in 2 Timothy 2:24-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
all <i>men, </i>apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that
oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
acknowledging of the truth;</p>

<p>This is talking about mankind.  God is telling us that when
we bring the Gospel, we are to make sure that we do so without fighting,
without arguing, and that we gently bring this to people.  It is then that He
will maybe grant them repentance.  It is then that He will maybe give them the
gift of repentance so that they will be able to turn from sin.  This is because
these things are all gifts of God.  If anybody becomes saved, it is because
repentance is a gift.  Faith is a gift.  Salvation is a complete gift of God. 
He does all of the work in the matter of saving someone.  </p>

<p>Of course, this is all past now.  This is all past.  This is
done.  God is not going to give the gift of repentance to salvation anymore;
that is, repenting from a dead heart.  This is because everyone whom He
intended to save has already been given a new heart, even though they may not
know this.  They may start repenting in their life, but they are not turning
from there heart because God has already turned them, like it says in Jeremiah
31, &ldquo;Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.&rdquo;  God has already done the inward
turning of every one of His elect.  </p>

<p>So it goes on to say in 2 Timothy 2:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>that </i>they may recover themselves out of the snare of
the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.  </p>

<p>These have been prisoners.  This is mankind.  When Satan
entered into the Garden of Eden and deceived Eve, Adam and Even both ate of the
fruit and they become servants to sin and to Satan.  They became prisoners,
captives.  </p>

<p>Man thinks that this is a wonderful prison.  They actually
do not even think that they are in prison.  Look at America.  We are known as
the land of the free, and we are.  We just had our Fourth of July and we thank
God that this is a free nation.  It is free politically, physically, and so
forth; but spiritually, the truth is that Americans are just as bound and in
bondage as those in China or Africa or India or anywhere else.  Men are in
bondage to sin and to Satan.  We are in a dungeon, spiritually speaking.  We
are in a dark place.  </p>

<p>We might have looked at the last couple of verses of
Proverbs 5 last time, but we read in Proverbs 5:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
be holden with the cords of his sins. He shall die without instruction; and in
the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  </p>

<p>This is talking about a sinner who is bound.  But who is
doing this binding?  We, ourselves, are doing this binding.  We are bound with
our own sins.  What is it that keeps us fast in the stocks?  It is our own sin
that we enjoy and have pleasure in.  It is this that really holds us fast.  </p>

<p>So when we are reading in Acts 16 that the foundations of
the prison house are shaken by a great earthquake and that this opens up all of
the gates in the prison and it opens up all of the bonds in the prison, what
does this mean?  It definitely means salvation.  </p>

<p>Actually, forget Acts 16.  We know that the Bible likens
sinners to prisoners.  We know this.  We also know that it was God&rsquo;s plan to
save all of His elect, every one of them, prior to May 21.  It is very much
like God to do a very great work at the very end or just before the door to
Heaven shut.  It is very much like Him to do this.  We have examples of this in
the Bible.  </p>

<p>In other words, we know that God was going to save a great
multitude of sinners.  In saving this great multitude, He would save the very
last of His elect.  In other words, this is in relation to all of them, to all
of the prisoners, without exception.  None would be left.  God&rsquo;s plan prior to
May 21 was to open the prison house completely, spiritually speaking, and to
free everyone, spiritually speaking.  </p>

<p>So we do not even have to look at Acts 16.  This is what we
were saying and this is what the Bible was teaching.  This is what we were
proclaiming.  All of the prisoners would be free before Judgment Day came.  We
were saying this.  Now we read Acts 16 and we find that it is speaking of midnight.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Exodus 12.  We know this account.  This is
speaking of the Israelites in bondage.  They were in hard, cruel, bondage. 
They were in slavery.  </p>

<p>What is another word for being a slave?  We are prisoners. 
We are bondsmen.  We are captives.  This is exactly what the Israelites were,
and the verses we read apply to the Israelites in Egypt.  But it was not God&rsquo;s
plan that they remain prisoners, that they would remain slaves to Pharaoh, and
so God began to send Moses and Aaron at the proper point in time.  </p>

<p>Who did Moses and Aaron go before?  They went before
Pharaoh.  What did they say again and again and again?  They said, &ldquo;Let my
people go,&rdquo; because it was time.  They said this to Pharaoh.  Who does Pharaoh
represent?  He represents Satan.  </p>

<p>Remember that 2 Timothy 2 says that the unsaved are &ldquo;taken
captive by him at his will,&rdquo; Satan&rsquo;s will; and God sent Moses and Aaron to
Pharaoh and brought plague after plague as He proclaimed, &ldquo;Let my people go.&rdquo;  But
Pharaoh would not and he hardened his heart.  At first, he said in his pride, &ldquo;Who
<i>is </i>Jehovah, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?&rdquo;  Then plague
after plague after plague came, until one final plague.  After this final
plague, God said that Pharaoh would let them go.  </p>

<p>We read about this plague of the firstborn in Exodus.  It
says in Exodus 12:29-31:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that at midnight JEHOVAH smote all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his
throne unto the firstborn of the captive that <i>was </i>in the dungeon; and
all the firstborn of cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his
servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for <i>there
was </i>not a house where <i>there was </i>not one dead. And he called for
Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, <i>and </i>get you forth from
among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve JEHOVAH, as
ye have said.  </p>

<p>So the death of the firstborn, which was a horrible
judgment, resulted in the release of all Israel.  How many Jews remained?  Not
one remained.  The Egyptians did not want a single Jewish person or an
Israelite left there.  They wanted them out, because their nation was ruined. 
There was not one house where there was not at least one dead, from Pharaoh to
the captive in the dungeon.  This was a desolation.  They wanted them to get
out, to go; and the Jews spoiled the Egyptians.  The Egyptians gave them gold
and silver and they hurried them out.  </p>

<p>At midnight after this last plague occurred, how long was it
before Pharaoh had Moses and Aaron before him again?  It was not very long.  It
was the next day.  They left on the fifteenth day of the first month.  Passover
was on the fourteenth day.  On the fifteenth day, the Israelites left Rameses
and they traveled out of Egypt and went to Succoth.  And &ldquo;Succoth&rdquo; is the same
word for &ldquo;tabernacles&rdquo; as in &ldquo;the feast of tabernacle.&rdquo;  They left Egypt and
went to a place that is the same word for &ldquo;the feast of tabernacles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;booths.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There are actually three big tie-ins to May 21 with the
release of captives.  This is one of them.  We see the connection with midnight.  We also see the release of the Israelites, which is definitely a picture of
salvation.  </p>

<p>Since May 21 was Judgment Day, it relates to midnight.  For instance, we read something in relation to this in Matthew 25.  At what
time was the cry made, &ldquo;Behold, the bridegroom cometh&rdquo;?  It was at midnight.  This is also a connection with midnight and the coming of Christ or Judgment
Day.  And we find a similarity with the Israelites, because it was at midnight when all of Israel was released.  </p>

<p>The second thing is the release of the captives from Babylon,
which again applies to Israel.  We can see this in 2 Chronicles 36.  I will try
to come to this, but I just want to show the similarities of these passages to
the prison house in Acts 16.  Then we want to answer the charge that a
spiritual judgment is not a real judgment, that it is just an excuse.  Then we
will look into these three examples a little bit more.  </p>

<p>It says in 2 Chronicles 36:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the
kingdom of Persia: To fulfil the word of JEHOVAH by the mouth of Jeremiah,
until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: <i>for </i>as long as she lay desolate
she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.  </p>

<p>So this was seventy years, and seventy years has everything
to do with the great tribulation.  We will not get into this, but there are
historical types of the great tribulation, like the seven years of famine in
Joseph&rsquo;s day, the 23-year period of 609 to 587 B.C. inclusively from the death
of Josiah to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the seventy years from the death
of Josiah in 609 to 539 B.C., which is when the Babylonian king, King Belshazzar,
was feasting and completely ignorant that the Medes and the Persians were
marching on his kingdom that very night.  Babylon was then taken like &ldquo;a thief
in the night.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>After seventy years, these Babylonians had no clue.  All of
the lords and princes were feasting and drinking and partying.  Only Daniel
knew.  Daniel knew from the writing on the wall that &ldquo;God hath numbered thy
kingdom, and finished it&hellip;and given [<i>it</i>] to the Medes and Persians.&rdquo; 
That very night, this king of Babylon was slain.  </p>

<p>This was a seventy-year period.  This is what this is
referring to here.  It is referring to the seventy-year period from 609 to 539
B.C.  This relates in every way to May 21.  We can actually relate these
seventy years to eighty-four years, because this seventieth year was the
eighty-fourth year according to God&rsquo;s own reckoning from historical passages. 
May 21, of course, was the 8400<sup>th</sup> day and the end of 23 years.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in 2 Chronicles 36:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
JEHOVAH <i>spoken </i>by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, JEHOVAH
stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom, and <i>put it </i>also in writing, saying, Thus
saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath JEHOVAH God of
heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem,
which <i>is </i>in Judah. Who <i>is there </i>among you of all his people?
JEHOVAH his God <i>be </i>with him, and let him go up.  </p>

<p>What is this referring to?  This is a release.  It is a
release of all the Jews in Babylon or in the Babylonian provinces.  Cyrus is
now the king over all of Babylon.  We know that they had a huge kingdom and
that the Jews had been dispersed amongst many provinces, but God raised up this
King Cyrus and God refers to him in Isaiah as, &ldquo;Cyrus, <i>He is </i>my
shepherd.&rdquo;  And at the end of seventy years, what do we find?  We find that God
likens His people to sheep, and here is Cyrus the shepherd who is issuing a
release to all of the captives or the prisoners of Babylon.  The prisoners are
set free at the end of these seventy years, and this relates to May 21.  </p>

<p>There is a third tie-in and similarity between captives and
Acts 16 and the prison house, which is the Jubilee; and so let us go to
Leviticus 25:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto
thee forty and nine years. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to
sound on the tenth <i>day </i>of the seventh month, in the day of atonement&hellip;  </p>

<p>What happened back in September 7, 1994?  On the first day
of the seventh month in 1994, there was a memorial blowing of the trumpets, of
ram&rsquo;s horns.  </p>

<p>Mr. Camping has pointed out that there was a memorial
blowing of silver trumpets in every month but the seventh month.  In the
seventh month, there was a blowing of ram&rsquo;s horns as a memorial of the
Jubilee.  </p>

<p>God ended the church age on May 21, 1988 and started a period of 2300 evening/mornings, which was a horrible time when virtually no one was
being saved in the world.  When these 2300 evening/mornings came to an end in
September of 1994, the trumpet of the Jubilee blew, the second Jubilee.  </p>

<p>We studied this.  It says in Isaiah 11, &ldquo;The Lord shall set
his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people.&rdquo;  This was
a second proclamation of freedom; like it says here in verse 10, Leviticus
25:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
throughout <i>all </i>the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye
shall return every man unto his family.  </p>

<p>So this is a release.  September 7<sup>th</sup> of 1994
began the Jubilee, which would go for 6100 days, but we identified this more as
the &ldquo;latter rain.&rdquo;  I think that we kind of forgot that this was a Jubilee
period.  This was a time when all of the captives would be released, and May 21
would be the final day, the 8400<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>We were coming up to May 21 and the great earthquake; and,
by the way, in the King James Version, it says &ldquo;at [<i>or about</i>] midnight&rdquo; in Acts 16; but if you look in Jay P. Green&rsquo;s Interlinear Bible, he interprets
it as &ldquo;toward midnight&rdquo; in relation to the great earthquake.  And as we were
approaching this judgment, as we were getting close to the end of God&rsquo;s
salvation plan, we kept telling this to others.  </p>

<p>I remember on that Friday night that I was out.  I am sure
that most of you were also.  May 21 was Saturday and we were out at the train
station at 69<sup>th</sup> Street.  We had a friend join with us who was
standing there hollering for about an hour that we should not be listened to
and that nobody should take our tracts.  This was happening because we were in
intense spiritual activity at that time.  Satan knew, even if mankind was
ignorant of this; but Satan knew that he had a kingdom and that he had
prisoners in that kingdom.  His kingdom was being ransacked like never before
in history.  God was saving a great multitude.  </p>

<p>I remember saying to people, and this was mostly our
emphasis because I did not talk about the next day being a great earthquake, I
said that this would happen on that night either at midnight or 1:00 A.M. in the morning due to Daylight Savings Time, which always messed me up.  But I
kept saying to people, &ldquo;Tonight the door to Heaven shuts.  The end of salvation
is tonight.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Did many of you not tell people this?  This really was the
big deal.  This was the big deal; it was not the shaking of the earth.  This
was the huge thing and this was our emphasis, &ldquo;Look; the door to Heaven
shuts.&rdquo;  John 10 says that Christ is the door, and the door was going to shut forever. 
There would be no more salvation.  This was our focus, but we either forgot
something or we did not emphasize it enough; because not only was God shutting
the door, He was opening all doors to all of His elect.  </p>

<p>Acts 16 tells us that &ldquo;all the doors were opened,&rdquo; but we
did not really look at it from this perspective.  He would open the prison
house.  All would be free who met the conditions that the Bible set forth.  The
Bible refers to this as those whose names are &ldquo;written in the Lamb's book of
life,&rdquo; predestinated to salvation from the foundation of the world; because
this is when Christ died and took the sins of His elect upon Him, paid the
penalty for those sins before the world began, rose from the dead to be
declared the Son of God, and, as the Son, created all things.  These are the
conditions that God set, and He numbered a great multitude.  We do not know how
many; maybe tens of millions.  </p>

<p>We are living in a world that is almost seven billion.  It
is not yet.  I Googled it.  It is not yet.  There is one estimate of this being
reached in October.  In October, there will be seven billion people upon the
earth.  Think about what is coming in October.  In October, there is an
estimate that there will be seven billion people upon the earth.  Some others
estimate that this will not happen until 2012.  There is no reason to get into
this, but this is an interesting little bit of information.  </p>

<p>God certainly saved a great multitude.  He tells us this.  These
number into the tens of millions, maybe 180 or 190 million.  As we read the
history of the Bible, He did not save that many before the time of Christ in
the Old Testament.  Neither did He save all that we would expect during the New
Testament.  He did save the best for last.  Not only this, He saved, probably
right up until that very last day, with the greatest act of salvation that the
world has ever known.  </p>

<p>Does it not say this about the earthquake in Revelation 16? 
If we look at this in comparison with Acts 16 and Revelation 6, which
identifies this earthquake with May 21, it says in Revelation 16:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying,
It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was
a great earthquake [<i>megas seismos</i>], such as was not since men were upon
the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and </i>so great.  </p>

<p>God has never saved as many people as He did during this
short little period of the great tribulation, this &ldquo;little season.&rdquo;  God
identified these words with May 21 and with the opening of a prison; and
everything that we read in the Bible about the captives going free has to do
with or can be shown to relate to Judgment Day and to May 21.  </p>

<p>By the way, Revelation 16 ties into Revelation 6.  Look at
Revelation 16:20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</p>

<p>This is similar language to what we read in Revelation 6.  </p>

<p>So we have been saying for a period of time that Judgment
Day happened on May 21, because the door to Heaven was shut; and this is a
fact.  People do not like this, of course.  Now we are saying that there was a
great shaking.  Among the unsaved, a lot of people were nervous.  This is true,
but God is the One who is identifying this great earthquake with salvation. 
This was a great work of God and a great act of God in saving a great multitude
of people.  </p>

<p>This is why we say, yes, there was a spiritual earthquake
that happened, the greatest earthquake that the world has ever seen.  This
happened on May 21, just as we were saying.  </p>

<p>Now we hear the charge, &ldquo;Come on!  Come on!  You guys!  Why
do you not just admit that you were wrong?  Why do not just admit this?  Say
that you were wrong.  This did not happen.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, we were wrong.  The ground did not shake.  We were
also wrong for not minimizing this part of it.  This is because the far greater
thing was the shutting of the door to Heaven and the opening of the prison to
the captives.  All of these physical things were minor, minor things that we
allowed to get out of hand.  This is because, of course, this is where the
natural mind of man goes and this is where the questions would be, &ldquo;What is
going to happen with the earthquake?  What is going to happen as a result of
this?&rdquo;  Because of this, we got sidetracked.  </p>

<p>We were wrong.  It is wrong for us to have gone in that
direction.  We should have brought the focus back to the really important thing
again and again and again.  We should have just said, &ldquo;Let us forget about the
earthquake and let us talk about salvation.  If you have hope for salvation, it
is now until May 21.&rdquo;  This is what we should have brought the focus back to
repeatedly.  </p>

<p>We are just going to have to look at how to understand the
Bible, how anybody can understand the Bible.  How can we understand the Bible? 
How is it possible to understand the Bible?  </p>

<p>The way in which the seminaries teach today is that there is
a certain method.  They teach that there is a way of understanding the Bible
and that we are just to follow their method.  But when we look at their
methods, they are all different.  They all come to different conclusions.  They
all have different teachings or doctrines.  When we hear their teachings and
doctrines, every one of them actually differs from the Bible itself, and this
is why we suspect that these seminaries, which are run by these churches,
really do not know how to understand the Bible.  They do not know how to come
to truth.  </p>

<p>To be a little bit lenient, this is understandable because
no man does.  Of ourselves, none of us know how to understand the Bible.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Matthew 16:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  </p>

<p>I referred to this earlier.  Jesus is talking to the
disciples, most of who were saved.  We know that Judas was not.  But He is telling
them to beware of leaven, and leaven has to do with bread.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 7, Matthew 16:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is </i>because
we have taken no bread.  </p>

<p>They make a natural connection.  He is warning them to
beware of leaven and leaven has to do with bread.  They relate this to not
having brought bread.  </p>

<p>So Jesus tells them to &ldquo;beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and of the Sadducees.&rdquo;  The disciples then reason among themselves
that because they have no bread, maybe Jesus is thinking that they will have to
borrow some from them and it might be defiled.  Maybe it will even be poisoned,
because they knew that they did not like them and that they did not like
Christ.  </p>

<p>These disciples were thinking naturally.  This is how people
think.  We tie one and one together.  We connect things on a natural level.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 8, Matthew 16:8-12:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Which </i>when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of
little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? How is it that ye do not understand
that I spake <i>it </i>not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees? Then understood they how that
he bade <i>them </i>not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of
the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  </p>

<p>Nowhere does Jesus say that He spoke to them in a parable.  Again
and again and again, Christ would say, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like&hellip;&rdquo;  But
the theologians will say that whenever Jesus was telling a parable, He would
give us an indicator.  </p>

<p>For instance, we read of the parable of Lazarus and the rich
man.  The Bible does not tell us that this is a parable, but it is.  </p>

<p>Here, it just seems like Christ and His disciples are having
a common discussion.  They are just talking as they are going along on this
journey.  Jesus just brings up a word and they do not understand.  But He
faults them, because it is their responsibility to understand, just like it is
our responsibility to understand.  </p>

<p>It is also the church&rsquo;s responsibility to understand that
when God says, &ldquo;When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let
him understand:) Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains,&rdquo;
that they are Judaea.  Also, when God makes mention of Babylon and commands,
&ldquo;Come out of her, my people,&rdquo; and so forth, it is the responsibility of people
to understand these parables, these parabolic statements.  </p>

<p>This is all our responsibility.  If God wrote the whole
Bible like this, which He did, it is our responsibility to know this.  Why do
we not?  We do not because we are dead spiritually.  It is because of our sin. 
We &ldquo;have eyes, and see not&rdquo; and we &ldquo;have ears, and hear not.&rdquo;  We are ignorant
of spiritual things.  This is our condition, and yet God is trying to help us. 
This is why God spoke in parables.  </p>

<p>We would think that over the centuries of the church age, it
would be possible to read a commentary on Matthew 13:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable spake he not unto them:  </p>

<p>We would think that over the span of 2,000 years that there
would be a commentary that the church could have developed in which a
commentator, a theologian, would say, &ldquo;You know, Christ is the Word made
flesh.  He tells us, &lsquo;In the volume of the book <i>it is </i>written of me,&rsquo;
and He spoke without a parable to the multitude.  Without a parable, He did not
speak.  Do you know what He is trying to do?  Since He is the Word, He is
trying to teach us how to understand the Word, the Bible.  He is trying to
teach us that this is how God wrote the whole Bible.  Without a parable, He did
not speak.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>Do we read this in any commentary?  How do we understand
this today?  Well, because we are living at the time when God is opening the
Scriptures and because we are living at the time when He is making these really
common things known, it becomes easy.  </p>

<p>For example, Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;Except a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;  Nicodemus must have been scratching
his head because he said, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter
the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?&rdquo;  But how was Nicodemus
thinking?  He was thinking naturally.  Then Jesus chides him, &ldquo;Art thou a
master of Israel, and knowest not these things?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is pretty simple, right?  From our perspective as we read
this and as God lays this all out in John 3, this is very simple.  But because
of the way in which God has written the Bible, nothing is simple.  If we think
that it is simple, this is mistake number one.  Because of this, we will go off
in a big way and we will go astray.  </p>

<p>The Bible is the most difficult and complex book known to
man.  We can add all the law books and the medical books and the science books
and compile them all together and there will be no comparison in the measure of
difficulty.  The Bible is the most difficult book because of its Author.  </p>

<p>This is what God tells us in Isaiah 55.  We read in Isaiah
55:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For my thoughts <i>are </i>not your thoughts, neither <i>are </i>your
ways my ways, saith JEHOVAH. For <i>as </i>the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.  </p>

<p>There are the heavens and here is the earth.  How much
higher are those stars that are out there?  How far away are they than the
earth?  The scientists give us numbers that are just astronomical and I guess
that we can believe them.  But that expanse is the space, the gulf, the boundary
between the mind of God &ndash; the infinite eternal mind of the Almighty God of the
Bible and our tiny finite little minds &ndash; and between you and me.  We can put
all seven billion of us together and total this enormous mass of minds and it is
still going to be about the same difference, because we are creatures.  We do
not get this too well, but we are creatures.  God is the Creator and He knows
all things.  This is His Book and His Word.  </p>

<p>So if on occasion, we do not understand something, like the
earthquake, and if we do not understand one point, while we do understand a
whole lot else, I think that this is forgivable.  But, alright, we are making
excuses again.  </p>

<p>Let us go to 1 Corinthians 2.  We read in 1 Corinthians
2:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">But God hath revealed <i>them </i>unto us by his Spirit: for the
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth
the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things
of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  </p>

<p>This is basically saying that you know you, yourself, and I
know me, myself, better than anybody else knows you or knows me.  Right?  Does
anybody really know you?  How about your wife or your husband?  They might know
you better than others, but does anybody really know you?  How many thoughts
have you not shared?  How many things have you done that you have never told to
anybody?  Nobody knows you like this, but you know these things.  Actually, we
have limitations even in knowing ourselves.  </p>

<p>So God is saying that your spirit within you knows you and
nobody else can know you like yourself.  And God&rsquo;s Spirit knows God and the
things of God.  </p>

<p>When a theologian or anybody goes to the Bible and they say
that through study and through diligence and through intelligence that they are
going to tell us what the Bible says, then they are forgetting one thing.  The
only One who knows the things of God, which would be the Being or the Spirit of
God who indwells that enormous Being, just like our spirit indwells our little
bodies, is this Spirit.  He is the only One who knows the things of God.  If we
try to understand the things of God without consulting Him or going to Him and
asking Him for help, and, more than this, without God&rsquo;s Spirit within us to
guide us, we are never going to come to any kind of truth.  </p>

<p>Look at John 16.  Jesus is speaking here.  We read in John
16:12-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Holy Spirit.  He is our Guide into
all truth.  We need Him.  This, of course, is the enormous problem with the
churches today.  The Holy Spirit is not there because the Holy Spirit came out
of the midst.  They have no Guide.  They have no One to direct them into
truth.  This is why the churches are in the condition and the situation that
they are in.  </p>

<p>But then there is that voice that says, &ldquo;Hold it; hold it! 
Concerning May 21, the churches were right and you were wrong.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There is really an amazing thing that happened in the world
and in the eyes of the world on May 21, apart from the things that we have been
looking at.  Here is the actual situation.  The churches and the congregations
of the world are without the Spirit of God and are full of errors.  This can be
documented.  Church after church after church, denomination after denomination
after denomination, is in spiritual darkness and blindness.  They are just full
of false gospels.  Their standing and condition amongst the world is that they
are despised and lowly-esteemed, as they really should be because they do not
have the Spirit of God.  </p>

<p>Then we have Family Radio, which is the most faithful
ministry in the world with the most faithful teacher who is in the world today,
Mr. Camping.  Mr. Camping has been ever careful as he has tried to find truth
and understanding.  He readily admits that he himself does not know anything. 
He knows that he cannot go to the Bible with his own mind, so he goes to God. 
He finds God&rsquo;s methodology of comparing Scripture with Scripture, spiritual
with spiritual, and he does this carefully as he comes to doctrines.  </p>

<p>Think of the doctrines that Family Radio teaches.  They
teach that only the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word.  Tongues are not allowed.  There is to
be no seeking for supernatural activity of any kind.  There is to be no
charismatic activity of any kind.  They also teach that the church is not the
authority over the Bible.  God is the authority.  The Bible is the authority.  </p>

<p>Who else says these things?  Also think of the salvation
message that has been brought forth through Family Radio, that man does nothing
and cannot do one thing in relation to their salvation.  </p>

<p>This is not what the churches teach.  Church after church
after church says that man is supposed to walk down that aisle, that man has to
somehow express the fruit of the Spirit by speaking in tongues.  Of course,
this is contrary to God and the Bible.  I could go on and on and on.  </p>

<p>So here, we understood things pretty well.  If there is any
place in the world where we are going to hear truth from a ministry, Family
Radio is it.  Stay away from the churches.  Then when a minor detail like a
great earthquake does not happen &ndash; and I understand that these are serious
things &ndash; suddenly, the churches are all vindicated and correct and Family Radio
is the false prophet.  Mr. Camping is the false prophet.  </p>

<p>This was an amazing slight of hand.  It was incredible. 
This is how things apparently stand, and it is all due to this great earthquake
not happening.  </p>

<p>But, tell me something.  First of all, let us allow that the
churches were correct, even though they are wrong about Judgment Day because it
did happen and even though they are wrong about the great earthquake because it
did happen; but there was no physical shaking of the ground and they were correct
on this.  How does this mean that the churches are correct on all of their
other doctrines?  Why should this be counted to them as some great thing?  </p>

<p>There were some Buddhists out there who also said that these
things were not going to happen.  There were Muslims out there who also said
that these things were not going to happen.  There were agnostics who said that
these things were not going to happen.  There were atheists who said that these
things were not going to happen.  </p>

<p>Is everything that the atheists believe correct now just
because they said that these things were not going to happen?  No.  Neither is
everything that the churches teach correct just because they, along with the
other nonbelievers of the world, were in agreement in saying that these things
were not going to happen.  </p>

<p>This does not make them correct in any way.  This also does
not make Family Radio wrong in every other doctrine.  This does not mean that
Family Radio is wrong in adhering to the Bible as the Word of God.  This does not
mean that Family is wrong in teaching that God does all of the work in
salvation.  This does not mean that Sunday is not the Sabbath.  </p>

<p>I think that there are children who think that they can go
play on Sunday now because these things did not happen.  This has nothing to do
with it.  This has nothing to do with the teachings and doctrines of the Bible
that are still true.  </p>

<p>Let us close here.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
