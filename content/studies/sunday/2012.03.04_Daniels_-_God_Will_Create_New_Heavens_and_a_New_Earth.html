description: |
  The universe is under the curse of God.
  At the end of time, God will completely destroy the earth.
  God will then create a new heavens and new earth.
  Our affliction is just for a moment and not worthy to be compared with heaven.
  Our attention should be on heavenly things, not on things of the earth and deceitfulness of riches.
