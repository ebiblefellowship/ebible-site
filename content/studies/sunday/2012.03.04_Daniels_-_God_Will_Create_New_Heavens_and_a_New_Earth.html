description: |
  The universe is under the curse of God.
  At the end of time, God will completely destroy the earth.
  God will then create a new heavens and new earth.
  Our affliction is just for a moment and not worthy to be compared with heaven.
  Our attention should be on heavenly things, not on things of the earth and deceitfulness of riches.

<p class="verse">1)  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2)  That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they <em>were</em> fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3)  And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
4)  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare <em>children</em> to them, the same <em>became</em> mighty men which <em>were</em> of old, men of renown.
5)  And GOD saw that the wickedness of man <em>was</em> great in the earth, and <em>that</em> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <em>was</em> only evil continually.
6)  And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
7)  And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
8)  But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse">12)  And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13)  And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14)  Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
15)  And this <em>is the fashion</em> which thou shalt make it <em>of:</em> The length of the ark <em>shall be</em> three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16)  A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; <em>with</em> lower, second, and third <em>stories</em> shalt thou make it.
17)  And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; <em>and</em> every thing that <em>is</em> in the earth shall die.</p>

<p class="verse">18)  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
19)  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that <em>were</em> under the whole heaven, were covered.
20)  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
21)  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
22)  All in whose nostrils <em>was</em> the breath of life, of all that <em>was</em> in the dry <em>land</em>, died.
23)  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained <em>alive</em>, and they that <em>were</em> with him in the ark.
24)  And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</p>

<p>2 Peter 3:1-14:</p>

<p class="verse">1)  This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <em>both</em> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
2)  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
3)  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
4)  And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <em>they were</em> from the beginning of the creation.
5)  For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
6)  Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
7)  But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
8)  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <em>is</em> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
9)  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
10)  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
11)  <em>Seeing</em> then <em>that</em> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner <em>of persons</em> ought ye to be in <em>all</em> holy conversation and godliness,
12)  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
13)  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
14)  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</p>

<p>Isaiah 66:22-24:</p>

<p class="verse">22)  For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
23)  And it shall come to pass, <em>that</em> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
24)  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</p>

<p>Revelation 21:1-7:</p>

<p class="verse">1)  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
2)  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
3)  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God <em>is</em> with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, <em>and be</em> their God.
4)  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
5)  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
6)  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
7)  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</p>

<p>Numbers 23:19:</p>

<p class="verse">19)  God <em>is</em> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <em>it</em>? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p>

<p>Psalms 37:10-13,18-22,29:</p>

<p class="verse">10)  For yet a little while, and the wicked <em>shall</em> not <em>be</em>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <em>shall</em> not <em>be</em>.
11)  But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
12)  The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.

<p class="verse">18)  The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
19)  They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
20)  But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <em>shall be</em> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
21)  The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
22)  For <em>such as be</em> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <em>they that be</em> cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>

<p class="verse">29)  The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 15:51-55:</p>

<p class="verse">51)  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
52)  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53)  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <em>must</em> put on immortality.
54)  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
55)  O death, where <em>is</em> thy sting? O grave, where <em>is</em> thy victory?</p>

<p>Isaiah 65:16-19:</p>

<p class="verse">16)  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
17)  For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
18)  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <em>in that</em> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
19)  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</p>

<p>Romans 8:17-26:</p>

<p class="verse">17)  And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <em>him</em>, that we may be also glorified together.
18)  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time <em>are</em> not worthy <em>to be compared</em> with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
19)  For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
20)  For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected <em>the same</em> in hope,
21)  Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
22)  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
23)  And not only <em>they</em>, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, <em>to wit</em>, the redemption of our body.
24)  For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
25)  But if we hope for that we see not, <em>then</em> do we with patience wait for <em>it</em>.
26)  Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>

<p>Romans 7:24:</p>

<p class="verse">24)  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 4:16-18:</p>

<p class="verse">16)  For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward <em>man</em> is renewed day by day.
17)  For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <em>and</em> eternal weight of glory;
18)  While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen <em>are</em> eternal.</p>

<p>Matthew 6:31-34:</p>

<p class="verse">31)  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
32)  (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33)  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
34)  Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day <em>is</em> the evil thereof.</p>

<p>Colossians 3:1-4:</p>

<p class="verse">1)  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
2)  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
3)  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
4)  When Christ, <em>who is</em> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>

<p>Hebrews 11:8-10,24-27:</p>

<p class="verse">8)  By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
9)  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <em>in</em> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
10)  For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <em>is</em> God.</p>

<p class="verse">24)  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
25)  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
26)  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
27)  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>
