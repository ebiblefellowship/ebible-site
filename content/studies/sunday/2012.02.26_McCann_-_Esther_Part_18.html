<p>Let us turn to Esther 8.  I will start reading in verse 7. 
It says in Esther 8:7-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they
have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. Write ye
also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal <i>it </i>with
the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and
sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. Then were the king's scribes
called at that time in the third month, that <i>is, </i>the month Sivan, on the
three and twentieth <i>day </i>thereof; and it was written according to all
that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies
and rulers of the provinces which <i>are </i>from India unto Ethiopia, an
hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the
writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews
according to their writing, and according to their language. And he wrote in
the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed <i>it </i>with the king's ring, and sent
letters by posts on horseback, <i>and </i>riders on mules, camels, <i>and </i>young
dromedaries: Wherein the king granted the Jews which <i>were </i>in every city
to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to
slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, <i>both </i>little ones and women, and <i>to take </i>the
spoil of them for a prey, Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, <i>namely,
</i>upon the thirteenth <i>day </i>of the twelfth month, which <i>is </i>the
month Adar. The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province <i>was </i>published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.<i> So </i>the
posts that rode upon mules <i>and </i>camels went out, being hastened and
pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the
palace. And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of
blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine
linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. The Jews had
light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. And in every province, and in every
city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had
joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became
Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</p>

<p>We will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>Before we get into Esther 8 and look at this verse by verse,
I would just like to mention something that someone has found regarding
numbers.  For instance, we know that the great tribulation period was 8400
days.  From May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011 was 8400 days exactly and an exact 23
years.  </p>

<p>This is no coincidence, because God identifies the number 84
with the great tribulation.  For instance, He uses the figure of 3.5 days in
Revelation 11.  This refers to the 2300 evening/mornings; but, still, this was
identifying with the great tribulation and 3.5 days is 84 hours.  So, again,
there is the number 84.  </p>

<p>We also know, historically, that there are certain types of
the great tribulation in the Bible, like the 7-year famine in Joseph&rsquo;s day.  7
years times 12, the number of months in one year, is 84.  There was the 70-year
period when Judah came under Babylonian assault and was finally delivered.  70
years times 12 is 840 months.  So this number continually shows up in relation
to the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Also, if you want to look at this in a certain way, 7,000
years from the flood is how many months times 12?  It is 84,000 months until
Judgment Day on May 21.  We could say that after 84,000 months, on the day that
was the 8400<sup>th</sup> day of the great tribulation, was Judgment Day.  So
we see that the number 84 continually comes into view.  </p>

<p>We have learned that God&rsquo;s plan for this period is to double
the five months, and so we made a correction.  It was not the 153 days as we
had thought.  Instead of 153 days, it was actually 147 days.  </p>

<p>We made this correction based on the Bible.  We can point to
Genesis 8:3-4 that says that the waters prevailed for 150 days and that the ark
rested on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup> month.  We took this
date, which was at the end of the five months of the flood that had begun on
the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  We were already using
this date as the underlying date for May 21.  Then we took the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of 7<sup>th</sup> month, which means that we are being even more Biblical,
and we found that this space of time is 147 days.  </p>

<p>Then we found that God instructs in the Bible to double this
in Revelation 18:6-7.  This was in the context of Babylon or this world.  We
read in Revelation 18:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s judgment was five months, but now He says to double
it, and so we double the space of days.  It is 147 plus 147, which is a total
of 294.  From May 21 of 2011 until March 9<sup>th</sup> of 2012, which would be
Adar 15 in the Hebrew calendar, is 294 days.  This breaks down to 2x147.  </p>

<p>Someone noticed something, and I can see how beneficial it
is when people are studying these things and then sending you information, like
people have been doing to Mr. Camping for years and years and years.  He is no
longer there.  Actually, who else is out there teaching right now besides just
a couple of people?  So, naturally, people are sending me things and I am
learning a lot.  This has been very beneficial.  </p>

<p>So this person has sent a study to me and he pointed out
that if you take 3.5 or three and a half days, which is 84 hours, and you
multiply that by 84, it equals 294 days.  But, actually, why would we use the
3.5 days?  </p>

<p>Well, we do not have to use this.  But, basically, 294 days
is 84x84 hours.  When we do this, we get 7,056 hours in 294 days or in 2x147
days.  So the number 84 that God has used in a big way in many passages carries
into this period of the doubling of the five months.  </p>

<p>In other words, we could say that the 8400 days of the great
tribulation ended on May 21, the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, and then God began a judgment of 2x5 months or 294 days.  This is 84x84
hours; and, again, the number 84 is still in view.  </p>

<p>I just wanted to mention this, because I do not think that
this is a coincidence.  If we had the number 293 or the number 295 or any other
number of days, we would not get 84x84, which is the number that shows up in so
many ways.  </p>

<p>So this is just a little bit of information that helps us to
verify that the dates are correct.  If this is correct, we should be finding
things like this.  We should be seeing things that verify this, and so this is
one thing that we have seen.  </p>

<p>Going back to Esther 8:7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they
have hanged upon the gallows&hellip;    </p>

<p>Notice that this is past tense now.  This means that they
did this rather quickly.  When they covered Haman&rsquo;s face and took him out, they
took him right to the gallows.  They went right to Haman&rsquo;s house, to his
courtyard or wherever it was that he had built those gallows.  Maybe it was in
his backyard, but he was hanged upon it immediately.  There was no delay.  The
king ordered this, and so they carried out the king&rsquo;s instructions quickly.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because he laid his hand upon the Jews.  </p>

<p>Spiritually, if we could write an inscription on Satan&rsquo;s
death stone, like we do when men die, this would be the reason for his death in
the sense that he lost all authority on May 21.  This will be the reason that
he will ultimately be destroyed on the last day of judgment.  It is because he
laid his hand upon God&rsquo;s people.  He tried to injure, to harm, and to come
against the people of God.  </p>

<p>God put up with these assaults for thousands of years
because this served His purpose.  He wanted Satan and used him in many
different ways in order to put this whole salvation plan on display to
principalities and powers.  He used Satan to do this, but God was never pleased
that Satan did this.  Satan was sinning through all of this time.  But,
finally, this will bring about his ruin and his destruction.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Esther 8:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
name, and seal <i>it </i>with the king's ring: for the writing which is written
in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.  </p>

<p>So they had a problem.  If you remember, there was an
earlier writing.  If we go back to Esther 3:12, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded
unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that <i>were </i>over every
province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the
writing thereof, and <i>to </i>every people after their language; in the name
of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.  </p>

<p>This is very, very similar language.  Esther 8:8 is actually
identical to when Haman had been given the authority.  Haman received the ring
of the king, which represents the authority of the king, and so he wrote or
commanded to be written that the Jews would be destroyed on a particular date. 
Then it was sealed with the king&rsquo;s ring, which indicated that it had the full
blessing of King Ahasuerus.  It carried his authority.  The power of his
kingdom stood behind it.  </p>

<p>We saw that the way in which this spiritually could relate
was because Satan was instrumental back in the Garden of Eden in bringing about
the fall of mankind.  As a result of mankind&rsquo;s fall into sin, what happened? 
Was there a decree made that sinners were to die, including all men?  Yes!  Was
here a final date that was decreed in the Bible.  Yes!  God wrote of Judgment
Day and the end of the world and He wrote this from the very beginning, because
He knows the end from the beginning.  Spiritually, Satan was involved in having
the Law of God that says that &ldquo;the wages of sin <i>is </i>death&rdquo; published to
all of the world.  </p>

<p>Then because of our sin, we would die.  Everyone would die. 
We were subject to die on that particular day in the sense that we would be
annihilated and completely wiped out in our whole being without ever any
possibility of coming to life again.  </p>

<p>This is why we can understand that Haman was involved with
the writing of this original decree that went out into all of the provinces and
that carried the king&rsquo;s seal.  This letter that went out in Esther 3 is also
referring to the Word of God, the Bible, and it was published that there would
be a Judgment Day.  This has been published all throughout history, especially
leading up to May 21.  </p>

<p>So here in Esther 8, once again, the king gives allowance or
permission to Esther and to Mordecai to write a letter or a decree or a
commandment that will bear his name and be sealed with his ring.  </p>

<p>He has already given Mordecai the ring that he had given to
Haman.  It was the king&rsquo;s ring that the king had given to Haman.  Haman wore
this temporarily, just as God gave authority to Satan temporarily when He
loosed him.  But after the end of the great tribulation, God removed that
authority from Satan.  Then on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, King Ahasuerus takes this ring back from Haman and he gives it to
Mordecai.  </p>

<p>Mordecai then rules over everything that Haman had
previously ruled over.  Mordecai was given full authority over all that was
Haman&rsquo;s, just as Christ has been given full authority over all the kingdom of
Satan that had been given to Satan during this period of his loosing.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Esther 8:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
month, that <i>is, </i>the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth <i>day </i>thereof&hellip; 
</p>

<p>We have pointed out something about &ldquo;that day.&rdquo;  Esther 8:1
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">On that day&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  Then Esther again &ldquo;on that day&rdquo; is pleading with the king for him to
reverse the letters of Haman, and the king grants her request.  She finds favor
in his eyes &ldquo;on that day.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But God does not tell us directly, &ldquo;That day &ndash; the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month &ndash; passed and then sometime later the scribes
are called and this information is written.&rdquo;  We do not think that He tells us
this directly, but He does.  This is because it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called <span class="underline">at that time</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time&rdquo; is translated a few times as &ldquo;in due season,&rdquo;
like in Deuteronomy 11 in relation to the latter rain.  It says in Deuteronomy
11:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">That I will give <i>you </i>the rain of your land <span class="underline">in his due
season</span> [<i>or at that time</i>], the first rain and the latter rain&hellip;    </p>

<p>God is indicating that there is a particular period for
this.  We know that the first rain would be a certain time of the year and that
the latter rain would come at the end of the year.  </p>

<p>So here in Esther 8:9, the king&rsquo;s scribes are called &ldquo;in due
season.&rdquo;  But why &ldquo;in due season&rdquo;?  Why not immediately?  Why not right away?  </p>

<p>The reason for this was because we have to realize that this
was a touchy situation.  There was already a law that had been sent out into
all of the provinces bearing the king&rsquo;s name and with the king&rsquo;s seal that said
that the Jews were to die.  They were the ones who were to die, and so that law
was unalterable.  It was the law of the Medes and the Persians and no one could
change this.  </p>

<p>This was just as King Darius in the book of Daniel labored
to the going down of the sun when he was deceived into casting Daniel into the
den of lions.  Those wicked presidents and princes kept coming to him and
reminding him that the law of the Medes and the Persians could not be changed. 
Then the king realized something.  He had been trying to delay the inevitable
as much as possible; and then, finally, he had Daniel cast into the den of
lions because he had written a law.  It did not matter whether or not it was
the wisest of laws and it did not matter that he realized that he had been
fooled.  It was still a law that the king of the Medes and the Persians had
given and it could not be altered or changed in any way.  </p>

<p>What does this remind us of?  This reminds us of the Word of
God, the Bible.  God &ldquo;changeth not.&rdquo;  Does His Word change?  His Word does not
change.  Can we alter it?  </p>

<p>Well, if you are thinking about publishing a new Bible,
sure.  If you have already published some of the modern versions of the Bible,
you altered it.  The Bible has been altered to make some money and it has been
altered to try to indicate that it will help people to learn the Bible better
if they put it in the language of our modern day.  </p>

<p>What a dangerous thing for anyone to do, to dare alter the
Word of God.  Even the Medes and the Persians would not dare to alter the word
of their king!  Now, we are talking about the King of kings and the Lord of
lords who has given His Word and how the church has altered it, and yet they
claim to be His people.  This is really a very sorrowful thing.  </p>

<p>So the Medes and the Persians had a law.  No matter what the
law was, it could not be changed at all.  The original law stood.  </p>

<p>This is not saying in Esther 8 that when the king grants
their request that they can write another law and give another decree.  This is
not saying that they did away with the first law at all.  They did not.  That
first law stood.  On the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the month Adar, the Jews were
to be killed.  Any of the enemies of the Jews could have tried, but the way
that circumstances were developing, they did not dare try.  </p>

<p>Mordecai was a wise man, and so we know that they would not
have hastily and carelessly just quickly called the scribes right at that
moment and hastily sent out a decree to all of the provinces.  For one thing,
they still had about 10 months until the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup>
month came.  The king had granted their request on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  They almost had a full ten months to do this.  They
also had the problem of the original law, which made this a sensitive
situation.  </p>

<p>So they would have carefully consulted with one another and
with the elders of the Jews.  They would have prayed for wisdom and guidance
before they wrote this new law.  They maybe even first showed something to the
king&rsquo;s counselors, to those who were familiar with the law of the Medes and the
Persians.  Would this new law be acceptable and not violate the first law in
any way?  We can be sure that this is what they did.  </p>

<p>Esther 8:9 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called at that time [<i>or in due
season, and this would have been a little over a month later</i>] in the third
month, that <i>is, </i>the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth <i>day </i>thereof&hellip; 
  </p>

<p>It was then that they were finally ready to call the scribes
and to have that law written.  </p>

<p>The 23<sup>rd</sup> day of the 3<sup>rd</sup> month would
have been 69 days from the first time that the decree had been given.  That
first decree had been given on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month.  1/13 to 3/23 is 69 days and 69 is 3x23.  </p>

<p>So one way that we can understand this is that it is God&rsquo;s
purpose to bring judgment, as the law that was now going out on the 23<sup>rd</sup>
day of the 3<sup>rd</sup> month would bring judgment on all of the enemies of
God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded
unto the Jews&hellip;    </p>

<p>Mordecai is a type of Christ, and so this is what Christ
commanded, spiritually.  Then this law is sent out:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and
rulers of the provinces&hellip;  </p>

<p>There are four groups that are mentioned, and the number
four points to the furthest extent of whatever is in view, like universality or
like the four points of the compass: north, south, east, and west.  This means
that this was to go into all the world.  </p>

<p>The next part of the verse assures us of this:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven
provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and
according to their language.  </p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-seven is really picturing the whole
world, as God&rsquo;s elect are typified by this number.  This was Sarah&rsquo;s death age
and she was &ldquo;the mother of us all.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So it is no coincidence that Ahasuerus ruled over 127
provinces.  All of the Jews were located in these provinces.  All of the elect
are located where?  They are located in the world.  We cannot say that there is
a nation where there are no elect.  </p>

<p>This is why there is an emphasis of this going to four
groups of people:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;unto the Jews&hellip;lieutenants&hellip;<span class="underline">deputies</span> and rulers&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;deputies&rdquo; is actually translated as &ldquo;governors&rdquo;
back in Esther 3:12.  We read in Esther 3:12 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded
unto the king's lieutenants, and to the <span class="underline">governors</span> [<i>or deputies</i>] that
<i>were </i>over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every
province according to the writing&hellip;  </p>

<p>So it is going to the same three groups.  It is going to the
lieutenants, to the governors, which is the same word as &ldquo;deputies,&rdquo; and then
it is going to the rulers.  The difference is that there is an added group of
people in Esther 8, which are the Jews.  The original decree was not sent to
the Jews even though they were the subjects of it; they were the ones that were
to be destroyed.  </p>

<p>The decree that is sent out in Esther 8 is sent by Mordecai
and he is sending it, first of all, to the Jews, then to the lieutenants,
deputies, and rulers of the people.  Why?  </p>

<p>I think that we can understand that God&rsquo;s purpose in sharing
this information of Purim is primarily and overwhelmingly for the elect.  This
information that God is opening up is for the comfort of His people.  This is
for their encouragement and for their strengthening and for their help.  </p>

<p>Just look at how the Jews receive this in Esther 8:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour. And in
every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his
decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is all positive for them.  This is all good news.  </p>

<p>Talk about &ldquo;good news&rdquo;!  The day that you are subject to be
destroyed is turned from one of misery to one of great salvation.  You are
delivered.  You have been set free.  You are not going to die.  You are going
to live.  Moreover, your enemy, Haman, is dead.  All of those who hate you will
also die on that day, but not you.  This was nothing but good news and great
encouragement to the people of God.  </p>

<p>It is surprising that there are believers today who are
fighting against this.  I understand that it is one thing to be confused and it
is one thing to doubt and to not be sure, but they are actively fighting
against this and disliking this, and so on.  They are not fighting against the
Scriptures.  They are not arguing that we are not seeing these things correctly
in Esther.  They are just making over-generalized arguments about how we did
not understand this or how we did not understand that.  </p>

<p>Well, let us talk about what we do know.  Let us read from
the Bible.  If they are finding fault with the study, we can then discuss
this.  But how can we discuss things when they are making basic generalities
and basic statements like, &ldquo;We did not know before, and so we cannot know
now.&rdquo;  Alright; then, therefore, we will never know anything.  </p>

<p>Is this really our conclusion?  No; we can know things.  God
is still the same God.  He is still giving us His Word and He is still giving
us the proper way of approaching His Word and of studying His Word.  We go to
the Bible.  If God is pleased, He can still show us information.  </p>

<p>So, here, the message of Purim goes to the Jews and then to
all of these rulers who have various responsibilities in Ahasuerus&rsquo; kingdom.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Esther 8:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed <i>it </i>with
the king's ring, and sent <span class="underline">letters</span> by posts on horseback, <i>and </i>riders
on mules, camels, <i>and </i>young dromedaries:  </p>

<p>Mordecai wrote in the king&rsquo;s name.  We already saw that he
sealed this with the king&rsquo;s ring.  </p>

<p>God is really emphasizing this.  He is indicating that this
has the authority of the king or that Christ is going to declare these things
with the authority of God because He is God.  Then Mordecai sends letters by
post on horseback.  </p>

<p>Remember concerning the earlier letter, we looked at 2
Corinthians 3:6.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life.  </p>

<p>The original letter killed, did it not?  It was a death
sentence for the Jews.  But what is this verse referring to?  It is referring
to the Bible, the Word of God.  This is because the Bible condemns us all.  It
condemns each one of us because of our sins and we are subject to die.  </p>

<p>So the first letter condemned.  It brought condemnation. 
But with the second letter, there is no condemnation.  &ldquo;<i>There is </i>therefore
now no condemnation,&rdquo; as Romans 8:1 says, for the people of God.  </p>

<p>It is interesting that this is a &ldquo;letter&rdquo; that is sent in
Esther 8:10.  This word is also translated as &ldquo;book&rdquo; in Nehemiah, which is the
book right before the book of Esther.  We read in Nehemiah 8:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into
the street that <i>was </i>before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the
scribe to bring the <span class="underline">book</span> of the law of Moses&hellip;    </p>

<p>We could say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the [<i>letter</i>] of the law of Moses, which JEHOVAH had
commanded to Israel.  </p>

<p>We also read at the end of Nehemiah 8:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the ears of all the people <i>were attentive </i>unto the <span class="underline">book</span>
of the law.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Nehemiah 8:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Ezra opened the <span class="underline">book</span> in the sight of all the people&hellip; 
  </p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;book&rdquo; that Ezra opened?  It says that it was
the &ldquo;law of Moses,&rdquo; but what is the &ldquo;law of Moses&rdquo;?  It is the Bible.  </p>

<p>So this is the same word in Esther 8:10 that is translated
as &ldquo;letters&rdquo; where Mordecai wrote in the king&rsquo;s name and sealed it with the
king&rsquo;s ring:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and sent <span class="underline">letters</span> by posts on horseback&hellip;  </p>

<p>Look at 2 Chronicles 30 where we find that posts were sent
in the days of Hezekiah with letters.  This is the same Hebrew word for &ldquo;posts&rdquo;
as in Esther.  2 Chronicles 30 is in relation to a Passover that Hezekiah
wanted to hold.  We read in 2 Chronicles 30:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king,
saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto JEHOVAH God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of
the hand of the kings of Assyria.  </p>

<p>Then look at 2 Chronicles 30:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and
mocked them. Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
themselves, and came to Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>So these posts were messengers who were carrying the word of
Hezekiah, and Hezekiah was another type of Christ and he was the king of Judah. 
</p>

<p>This was in regards to coming to the Passover feast in Judah. 
He sent the message to Israel and most of them laughed and mocked this; it was
a joke.  But, as usual, here and there were God&rsquo;s people who humbled
themselves, or God humbled them and gave them contriteness.  They then went in
obedience to the letter that they had received from the posts.  </p>

<p>So they heard the news from the rider or the runner. 
Sometimes in Israel, we read that they had runners who would carry a message. 
How ever it was that they carried it in the days of Hezekiah, the posts brought
the news; and so in the kingdom of Ahasuerus, they used this same method of
communication.  The mail system was through these riders.  </p>

<p>Notice in Esther 8:10 that there were four animals that were
used.  There were horses, mules, camels, and young dromedaries.  </p>

<p>Again, the word went to four different people groups and now
we read of four animals.  This indicated that this was to go everywhere.  This
was to go into all the world.  It was to reach everyone in the kingdom,
especially the Jews.  They were to hear this information.  </p>

<p>We have to wonder about this because we are now looking at
the message of Purim and this is after the message of May 21.  We know that the
message of May 21 went into all the world, but how many people are hearing
about the message of Purim?  </p>

<p>I would say that just over the last couple of months, which
is just an estimate that is based on some of the little amount of advertising
that we have been able to do, that the total is probably a few hundred
thousand.  A few hundred thousand have heard through EBible or through studies
or have seen something through advertising.  More will, Lord willing, as we
lead up to this date; but it is very unlikely that 7 billion will or that 200
million or anything near that number of the elect will hear this.  </p>

<p>We have to think about something first, though.  What
exactly is the message of Purim?  What is the message of Esther that the posts
were carrying?  There was more to the message than just the date.  They were
carrying the news that Haman, the Jews&rsquo; enemy, was killed and that Mordecai was
exalted.   </p>

<p>We can know that this information was included, because it
says in Esther 9:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of
Mordecai fell upon them.  For Mordecai <i>was </i>great in the king's house,
and his fame went out throughout all the provinces&hellip;  </p>

<p>So they were aware in all the provinces that Haman, the
Jews&rsquo; enemy who hated them, was slain and that Mordecai was put in his place
and placed second under the king.  This news traveled everywhere.  </p>

<p>They also knew that Mordecai was a Jew himself, that he
favored the Jews, that they were his people, and, therefore, this new law was
written to help and protect the Jews so that they would not be slain.  Then the
final piece of information was that this would all take place on the date of
the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month.  </p>

<p>But with all of the other information, if you look at it,
what was being taught on Family Radio for a few months and in an intense way
leading up to October?  </p>

<p>Let us think about this.  Who is in control of the ministry
of Family Radio?  God is.  Mr. Camping has taught the Bible Study and the Open
Forum for over 50 years.  We know that God has protected that ministry, that He
has blessed that ministry, and that He used that ministry to reach the whole
world.  </p>

<p>First of all, what message was it that was broadcast on
Family Radio after May 21 on a daily basis in the Bible Study to the whole
English-speaking world?  What was the message that was being broadcast day
after day after day for about three months?  </p>

<p>The message was that May 21 was Judgment Day, that Satan had
been defeated on that day, that he was put down, that he lost all authority,
that Christ was exalted, and that God&rsquo;s Kingdom won the greatest victory in the
world, which, of course, was apart from what Christ had done in paying for the
sins of His people.  What was taught was that May 21 was the great day of
triumph and victory and that all of the elect were saved.  All of the elect in
all of the world were saved.  There were no more to become saved; they were all
saved.  We were also saying that the future would bring a day of final judgment
when God would destroy the world.  </p>

<p>Basically, this was the entire message of Purim.  When I
studied the book of Esther, this is one of the things that I noticed.  I
noticed that the message matched, and I did not even look into Esther all that
much when studying those other things, and yet this matched.  It agreed perfectly
with these spiritual things that we had learned from the rest of the Bible and
that were being taught on Family Radio.  </p>

<p>I know that some people looked at that as a mistake.  They
think that it was a mistake that this was taught on Family Radio; but, again,
who is in control?  Could God have set somebody up in Family Radio to teach
salvation?  Could He have set somebody up to teach the ongoing nature of the
Gospel and that the Gospel was to go out into the world again?  </p>

<p>Certainly, He could have.  But did He?  He did not.  He
wanted this taught and He wanted this emphasized in a great way because, just
as we are learning in the book of Esther, it was Mordecai who commanded that
this message was to be carried to all of the Jews in all of the provinces to all
of the people.  And what was taught on Family Radio after May 21 matches
perfectly with what is being taught as we learn about the feast of Purim.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Esther 8:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherein the king granted the Jews which <i>were </i>in every
city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to
slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, <i>both </i>little ones and women, and <i>to take </i>the
spoil of them for a prey,  </p>

<p>So the king granted the Jews in every city to gather
themselves together and to stand for their life; and this language of standing
is significant.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 130:3.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">If thou, JEHOVAH, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand?  </p>

<p>Who is going to stand if God marks our sin?  If He were to
just say that the man who sins will die and then have no provision for grace
and no provision for the Gospel of salvation at all, then no one would stand. 
We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  We are all guilty, &ldquo;There
is none righteous, no, not one.&rdquo;  We cannot stand.  No one can stand on their
own.  It is only when God saves people that He causes them to stand; and this
is what is being stated in Esther 8.  We will stand for our life.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to a couple of verses regarding this.  Let us
go to Ephesians 6.  We read in Ephesians 6:10-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against
the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i>places.</i> Wherefore take unto
you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day&hellip; 
</p>

<p>What is &ldquo;the evil day&rdquo;?  That is Judgment Day.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your
loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</p>

<p>Then it continues with the rest of the &ldquo;armour of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So God is talking here about &ldquo;having done all,&rdquo; which
reminds us of the statement in Hebrews 10:36:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
of God, ye might receive the promise.  </p>

<p>Why would we have &ldquo;need of patience&rdquo; after we have &ldquo;done the
will of God&rdquo;?  How could you and I complete the doing of the will of God?  </p>

<p>This would only be possible in one sense.  If God had a plan
to carry the Gospel to all of the world and if He then completed that plan;
therefore, if we completed our task in being watchmen and blowing the trumpet,
it is then that we would have done the &ldquo;will of God&rdquo;; and we now see that there
is a period of time that follows us having done the &ldquo;will of God&rdquo; when we have
to wait patiently to receive the promise.  </p>

<p>It is this time that God is talking about in Ephesians 6
where He says &ldquo;that ye may be able to stand&hellip;in the evil day,&rdquo; in Judgment Day,
&ldquo;and having done all, to stand&rdquo;; and we stand only by God&rsquo;s grace.  We stand
only by His mercy and only by His will, His moving in us to do so.  We stand
completely at the will of God.  </p>

<p>This is what the commandment in Esther is saying.  He is
telling the Jews to stand for their life.  They are to stand in what day?  They
are to stand on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month.  </p>

<p>In Judgment Day, we are to stand for our lives, because God
is giving us this ability.  He is telling us to do this, He is commanding us to
do this, and He will cause us to do this.  Basically, God is giving us this encouragement
that we are to stand.  </p>

<p>Remember what Jesus said about a house divided.  He said
that a &ldquo;house divided against itself shall not stand.&rdquo;  What happened to
Satan&rsquo;s kingdom on May 21?  It fell.  </p>

<p>If we go to Daniel 5, as Daniel is interpreting the writing
on the wall, look at verse 28.  It says in Daniel 5:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Persians.  </p>

<p>So that is the end of the 70 years.  It is the day that the
king of Babylon, who typifies Satan just as much as Haman, is slain and he is
slain at a banquet of wine, just as Haman was.  At the end of the 70-year
period, his kingdom did not stand, &ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen,&rdquo; which is
stated twice.  And it is pointed out that the writing on the wall is also
doubled, &ldquo;MENE, MENE.&rdquo;  &ldquo;MENE&rdquo; means that &ldquo;God hath numbered thy kingdom, and
finished it.&rdquo;  We could say this twice, &ldquo;God hath numbered thy kingdom, and
finished it,&rdquo; because He has brought double destruction upon Babylon.  </p>

<p>Babylon did not stand, and yet God&rsquo;s people continue to
stand, but only by His grace.  We wait on the Lord patiently and we look to
Him.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Luke 21.  After going a little bit further
in this chapter, we will stop here and take a break after this.  We read in
Luke 21:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you know what this word &ldquo;perplexity&rdquo; means?  It is
actually translated this way.  It means &ldquo;doubt.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately after the tribulation of those days,&rdquo; Matthew
24 tells us, &ldquo;the sun [<i>shall</i>] be darkened, and the moon shall not give
her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Luke 21:25 is speaking of the very same thing, but God is
helping us by telling us that these things are signs and not to be taken
literally.  They are &ldquo;signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars.&rdquo; 
What follows after May 21 is &ldquo;distress of nations, with [<i>doubt</i>],&rdquo; with
all sorts of doubt.  </p>

<p>We know that people are so perplexed and wondering what is
going on.  There is such confusion, and God is telling us that this is exactly
what He foresaw.  He foresaw that there would be &ldquo;perplexity&rdquo; all over the
earth and even amongst the people of God. </p>

<p>Notice the next part of Luke 21:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the sea and the waves roaring;  </p>

<p>If the sea and the waves are &ldquo;roaring,&rdquo; what does this mean
about the sea?  What type of sea is that?  It is a troubled sea.  It is not
calm waters; it is a troubled sea.  </p>

<p>In Isaiah 57, God tells us about a &ldquo;troubled sea.&rdquo;  Again, I
am the beneficiary of someone who noticed this and sent me a note, which is
very helpful.  We read in Isaiah 57:20-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wicked <i>are </i>like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest&hellip;  </p>

<p>What do we read about Judgment Day?  There is &ldquo;no rest day
nor night,&rdquo; which is speaking of the rest that we find in Christ.  Remember
that Matthew 11 tells us, &ldquo;Come unto me, all <i>ye </i>that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo;  Well, God did, but not today, not at
this time.  </p>

<p>Isaiah continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the wicked <i>are </i>like the troubled sea, when it cannot
rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<i> There is </i>no peace, saith my
God, to the wicked.  </p>

<p>Luke 21:25 is indicating that the people of the world who
are unsaved are like &ldquo;the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,&rdquo; because there is
no more rest &ldquo;day nor night.&rdquo;  There were five months of torment and they were
doubled to ten months when there is no rest or no salvation available for
anyone.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Isaiah Luke 21:26 says: </p>

<p class="verse">Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 
</p>

<p>We are going to have to stop here.  We still have another
study and I have already gone into material for the next study.  </p>
