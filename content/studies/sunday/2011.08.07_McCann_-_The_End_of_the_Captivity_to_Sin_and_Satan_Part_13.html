<p>I would like to just mention first, and then we will move
on, how it is possible that 200 million are judging the world at this time.  We
wonder how this is.  But God gave us this number.  He is the One who said that
200 million were bound in Babylon.  These are the ones who are loosed, these
are the ones who will slay the third part of men, and God has given us this
number.  This identifies with May 21 and this identifies with the 6100 days of
the &ldquo;latter rain,&rdquo; which ended on May 21.  On this day or just prior to this
day, God loosed all these people and saved them all over the world.  How can
they accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and His task of being an army?  </p>

<p>By the way, take a look at Joel 2.  This had been identified
with the locusts and it was identified correctly; but, actually, this seems to
fit the 200 million just as well.  It says in Joel 2:1-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;tremble&rdquo; is also the word for &ldquo;quake.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of
JEHOVAH cometh, for <i>it is </i>nigh at hand; A day of darkness and of
gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon
the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
neither shall be any more after it, <i>even </i>to the years of many
generations. A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth&hellip;  </p>

<p>We see here fire and brimstone language.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the land <i>is </i>as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.  The
appearance of them <i>is </i>as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so
shall they run.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the 200 million horsemen.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong
people set in battle array. Before their face the people shall be much pained:
all faces shall gather blackness. They shall run like mighty men; they shall
climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
they shall not break their ranks: Neither shall one thrust another; they shall
walk every one in his path: and <i>when </i>they fall upon the sword, they
shall not be wounded. They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run
upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the
windows like a thief.</p>

<p>By the way, Christ comes &ldquo;as a thief in the night.&rdquo;  His
people are judging the world with Him, so we also are likened to coming &ldquo;as a
thief.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">The earth shall quake before them&hellip;  </p>

<p>The great earthquake opens up the prison doors or it looses
the prisoners who were bound.  Again, God is making reference to the great
earthquake of May 21.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark,
and the stars shall withdraw their shining:  </p>

<p>This is what immediately happened after the great
tribulation, immediately.  </p>

<p>So God is tying in these horsemen who are coming in battle
array like a war.  They are all marching in unison and they are coming to
accomplish His purpose of bringing fire and brimstone or judgment on the
world.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Joel 2:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp <i>is
</i>very great: for <i>he is </i>strong that executeth his word: for the day of
JEHOVAH <i>is </i>great and very terrible; and who can abide it?  </p>

<p>So here are these 200 million.  </p>

<p>There is another reference in Ezekiel 37 with the valley of
dry bones.  It is interesting language here.  I will read from verse 4.  It
says in Ezekiel 37:4-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of JEHOVAH. Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH
unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall
live: And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall
know that I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I
prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking [<i>or an earthquake</i>],
and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the
sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but <i>there
was </i>no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind,
prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; Come
from the four winds [<i>where the four angels were</i>], O breath, and breathe
upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and
the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
exceeding great army.</p>

<p>This is speaking of the great multitude, the 200 million. 
Here is a quaking, a shaking, and then these bones come to life.  They stand
upon their feet, &ldquo;an exceeding great army.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The great earthquake of May 21 did happen.  Spiritually, God
shook the foundations of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and He loosed all of the prisoners,
every single one who was elect.  They were loosed.  How God views them is that
they are like an army now marching forth, &ldquo;an exceeding great army.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But what is the reality?  The reality is that these 200
million are in Africa and in India and in China and in Turkey.  They are in
Muslim countries.  They are around the world and they are not getting together
with these other 200 million.  We cannot get together with them.  We do not
know who was saved and who was not saved.  </p>

<p>So how are we going to have this perfect unity?  How are we
all going to march forward like an army, bringing fire and brimstone, and make
the Garden of Eden before us like a desolate, burnt wilderness?  How is this
going to happen?  </p>

<p>Look at this from God&rsquo;s perspective.  He just saved 200
million people.  What would He normally do if this were any other period in
history?  What would He do with these 200 million?  Would they not be involved
in the Great Commission, &ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature&rdquo;?  They would also normally be involved in warning about death
and warning about Judgment Day, warning that time is short.  They would be
bringing the Gospel message also that God saves, that He does all of the work
in salvation, that it is all by His faith and not by the faith of man.  </p>

<p>The big difference, however, is that God is not saving now,
no one anywhere in the world; and so there really is no point in bringing a
message to everyone who is already under judgment.  We brought the Gospel
message in order that God might bless His Word and that He might spark an
individual to life through the seed of His Word, that it might take root in their
heart and that fruit might come forth.  </p>

<p>But now this is not happening.  All of those whom God saved
already have a new heart.  Every single one of them already has a new
born-again soul.  Yet there is one way that God can use all 200 million, even without
their knowledge of it and, in essence, accomplish His purpose of bringing fire
and brimstone.  </p>

<p>Look at John 1:50-51.  Jesus is speaking to Nathaniel.  It
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I
saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than
these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye
shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the
Son of man.</p>

<p>Again, the word &ldquo;angels&rdquo; is &ldquo;messengers.&rdquo;  This is not
speaking of spirit beings.  This is not talking about those angels who are in
Heaven and who minister to the heirs of salvation.  This is talking about God&rsquo;s
people.  </p>

<p>When God saves a sinner, and this is how it has been all
throughout history, it is immediately as though they ascended into the
heavenlies to be seated at the right hand of God.  But just as immediately,
they were dispatched from Heaven as a messenger back to earth, back in their
same corrupt body, back into who they are.  No one can tell that this person
just became saved and was just commissioned by God to be a worker and a servant
of His in carrying His message.  They become a messenger of the Gospel.  God
has done this all throughout history to varying degrees.  </p>

<p>Why were so many people stirred up prior to May 21 to get
the Word out?  Who did this?  Family Radio has been on the air for fifty plus
years, and yet we never saw anything like this.  Who stirred them up?  God
did.  He moves in His people &ldquo;to will and to do of <i>his </i>good pleasure.&rdquo; 
He moved them to bring this message to the world as messengers, which is all
that we are.  We are doorkeepers.  We are servants.  This is a humble job, but
thank God if we qualify for it by His grace.  </p>

<p>So, immediately, God saves someone.  Then all of a sudden
this person prior to May 21 starts listening and realizes, &ldquo;There are only a
few months left, but I have to play a part in this.  I need to be obedient to
God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I know that we were meeting all kinds of new people.  After
only one month or two months or three months, it seemed that they were saved
and they were out there almost right away getting this message out.  This is
because this was God&rsquo;s will and His plan to send forth the warning message that
Judgment Day would be May 21.  </p>

<p>He could do this now.  He has 200 million now at His
disposal.  He can move in them.  This does not take anyone but God.  He could
have all of these 200 million start handing out tracts and warning everyone in
sight, if He wanted to.  </p>

<p>The fact that Family Radio stopped the sending forth of the
Gospel, warning about October 21, has nothing to do with the media and
embarrassment.  It has zero to do with this.  It has nothing to do with the
church&rsquo;s perspective of Family Radio and its listeners as being heretics and
that we are somehow too embarrassed to take a stack of tracts and go down to
City Hall by the Clothespin in Philadelphia.  </p>

<p>Maybe initially there was some confusion, but we can be sure
that God is not going to allow this.  God&rsquo;s people have already taken a lot of
abuse and a lot of criticism from the media and from the church leading up to
May 21.  </p>

<p>Did this stop anyone?  Did caring what people thought stop
anyone?  Did we care?  Do we really care now?  No.  We would put the shirts
back on and the hats back on and we would take some tracts out with us.  We
would continue even now, if this were God&rsquo;s will.  </p>

<p>We were not silenced.  We were not put to death.  We were
victorious.  God was victorious.  He won a great victory on May 21.  He
ransacked the kingdom of Satan, and Satan was powerless to do anything about
it.  God officially stripped the title of ruler from Satan in the churches. 
Satan is nothing now.  </p>

<p>So none of these things would have stopped the believers at
all.  But, you see, angels or messengers of God have ascended and descended
upon the Son of Man all throughout history.  Now God has 200 million.  All He
has to do is move in them through His Word and they will do His bidding, and
they are because Christ stopped it there.  He did not dispatch 200 million into
the world.  He is not sending them forth to bring the Gospel message, which is
in recognition that the ground has been destroyed by fire and brimstone,
spiritually.  Fire and brimstone has destroyed the whole earth.  We do not sow
on ground destroyed by fire and brimstone.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 13.  In the first few verses, we read of the
parable of the sower.  Then we read of Christ&rsquo;s explanation.  This is found in
verse 18, and so we read in Matthew 13:18-22:    </p>

<p class="verse">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth
the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it </i>not, then cometh the
wicked <i>one, </i>and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is
he which received seed by the way side. But he that received the seed into
stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon [<i>or immediately</i>]
with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while:
for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he
is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the
word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the
word, and he becometh unfruitful.  </p>

<p>In relation to sowing seed, we repeatedly see references to
the Word of God.  This is the seed of the Gospel, the spiritual seed.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 55:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and
bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my
word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but
it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper <i>in the thing </i>whereto
I sent it.  </p>

<p>Again, the Word is sown and the sowing of seed is like the
Word of God.  </p>

<p>Turn to Deuteronomy 29.  We read in Deuteronomy 29:23:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>And that </i>the whole land thereof <i>is </i>brimstone, and
salt, <i>and </i>burning, <i>that </i>it is not sown, nor beareth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;beareth&rdquo; is the same word that is translated
&ldquo;bud&rdquo; in Isaiah 55:10 where it says, &ldquo;It bring forth and bud.&rdquo;  It is the same
Hebrew word.  </p>

<p>So this says that the land is not sown.  We are not supposed
to throw our seed on land that has been destroyed by fire and brimstone.  </p>

<p>Do you remember what happened on Mount St. Helens?  It was
quite awhile before they could do anything with that land in the surrounding
area because the lava flowed.  This just destroyed the possibility of sowing
seed for some time and of bringing forth fruit.  </p>

<p>God is not sending forth these 200 million.  He is not
commissioning them.  He saved them and the instructions are, &ldquo;Feed them.  Feed
My sheep.&rdquo;  They are likened to sheep.  In this case, they are not likened to
an army, and yet they are an army.  They are &ldquo;an exceeding great army.&rdquo;  They
are 200 million strong who God could greatly work with in just richly blessing
the whole earth, except He cannot because the Day of Judgment has come and He
is bringing judgment upon the whole world and the world is not to be sown.  We
are not to bring the Gospel message in this sense anymore.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Psalm 11:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the wicked he shall rain <span class="underline">snares</span>, fire and
brimstone&hellip;    </p>

<p>In relation to the word &ldquo;snares,&rdquo; let us go to Joshua
23:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Know for a certainty that JEHOVAH your God will no more drive
out <i>any of </i>these nations from before you; but they shall be <span class="underline">snares</span>
and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until
ye perish from off this good land which JEHOVAH your God hath given you.  </p>

<p>Turn also to Job 18.  In Job 18, we will find this same
Hebrew word used there.  We read in Job 18:5-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of
his fire shall not shine. The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his
candle shall be put out with him. The steps of his strength shall be
straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down. For he is cast into a net
by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. The <span class="underline">gin</span> shall take <i>him </i>by
the heel, <i>and </i>the robber shall prevail against him. The snare <i>is </i>laid
for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gin&rdquo; is this same word.  </p>

<p>So the unsaved, the wicked man, is being snared by a trap. 
In one place, it takes him by the heel, like those traps that are placed out in
the jungle.  It can catch someone&rsquo;s foot and they would be hanging there by a
tree.  They are caught.  </p>

<p>What is the snare?  We can understand fire and brimstone,
but what about raining snares?  We can understand fire and brimstone.  Yes; God
is bringing judgment.  The door to Heaven is shut.  But what is the snare?  </p>

<p>Well, nothing happened!  Nothing happened on May 21!  This
not only snared the world, the media, and the churches &ndash; because to those in
the church, it is a joke because nothing happened &ndash; but it also snared many of
you and me.  At first, this was a snare to many of us.  </p>

<p>There were people out there who were getting the Gospel
message out that May 21 would be Judgment Day.  We were sharing this, but then
we thought that nothing happened.  Well, something did happen.  God saved all
of His people.  This is not a little thing.  This is not a little thing at
all.  This is a tremendous thing.  This is why the earthquake is described as &ldquo;so
mighty an earthquake, <i>and </i>so great.&rdquo;  It was so great and so mighty that
the world has never seen anything like this.  This is because God set all of
His people free.  Yet there are some people who do not see this.  </p>

<p>If you do not see this and if you think that nothing
happened, then this is taking you like a snare.  If you are still sowing the Gospel,
if you are still encouraging people to bring the Gospel because perhaps God
might save a person today, you are, first of all, not recognizing that the
ground is under fire and brimstone.  This means that you are denying Judgment
Day.  You are denying what God did on May 21.  God laid a trap that only He
could lay.  </p>

<p>Take a look at Psalm 91: 3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely he shall deliver thee from the <span class="underline">snare</span> of the
fowler, <i>and </i>from the noisome pestilence.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 124:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the <span class="underline">snare</span> of the
fowlers: the <span class="underline">snare</span> is broken, and we are escaped.  </p>

<p>Look at Proverbs 7:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the <span class="underline">snare</span>,
and knoweth not that it <i>is </i>for his life.  </p>

<p>Turn to Ecclesiastes 9:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken
in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the <span class="underline">snare</span>; so <i>are
</i>the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. 
</p>

<p>This is speaking of a trap and being caught.  This happened
on May 21.  </p>

<p>This is just like when Jesus went to the cross.  As they
looked at Him, they did not see anything.  They thought that He would be a king
who would deliver Israel.  How disappointed they were.  To them, nothing
happened on the cross except that Christ was killed.  This is what the world
thought.  Then the church at that time said to the Roman authorities that they
wanted a guard posted at His grave because &ldquo;that deceiver said&hellip;&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This was the line that the church of that day gave
concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.  They called Him a deceiver.  In essence,
they were saying that it was a lie and that He was not going to rise from the
dead, &ldquo;See, He did not come down from the cross.  He was a man just like anyone
else.&rdquo;  Yet this tableau was the greatest victory that the Kingdom of Heaven
had ever seen.  </p>

<p>But even the believers fell for this.  Even the disciples
were cast down and thinking that they had trusted that He would be this great
Messiah.  Yet He was, and so Christ had to correct them.  </p>

<p>Did the world ever correct its thinking about what happened
on the cross?  Did the Jews?  No; up until this day, they deny that anything
happened on the cross.  So, too, when God snared the world on Judgment Day, May
21.  </p>

<p>Do not get your information from the news media as to what
happened.  Certainly, do not listen to the churches as to what happened. 
Listen to what the Bible says, and God tells us what happened.  It was the
greatest victory that the Kingdom of Heaven has ever seen outside of what
Christ has done.  </p>

<p>Look at Luke 21:34-35:  </p>

<p class="verse">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and <i>so
</i>that day come upon you unawares [<i>or suddenly</i>]. For as a snare shall
it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. </p>

<p>How was it a snare when we were telling everyone that
Judgment Day would be May 21 and the world took note?  There were groups of
concerned individuals who gathered together to see what was going to happen
over in New Zealand early that morning, and then they threw some beer in there
because God tells us that &ldquo;the misery of man <i>is </i>great upon him,&rdquo; and so
God allows for man to have some alcohol to deal with his misery; and this
misery is the judgment and wrath of God; and so May 21 came and went and it was
a snare, a trap.  </p>

<p>Since God is saying in Psalm 11:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone&hellip;  </p>

<p>This means that we also look at the fire and brimstone as a
spiritual thing.  This is because, obviously, traps are not falling from the
sky.  Snares or gins for the fowler are not falling.  Neither is literal fire
and brimstone falling.  But fire and brimstone has everything to do with the
judgment of God.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to the book of Revelation and look at chapter
14.  It says in Revelation 14:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there followed another angel,
saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.   </p>

<p>&ldquo;Babylon is fallen&rdquo; is a key phrase and this points to May
21, Judgment Day.  This is when Babylon fell.  This happened historically after
seventy years and spiritually at the end of the 23-year great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 14:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive <i>his </i>mark in his
forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he
shall be tormented with fire and brimstone&hellip;  </p>

<p>This speaks of those who worshipped the beast.  </p>

<p>Turn to Revelation 15:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
angels [<i>or messengers</i>] having the seven last plagues; for in them is
filled up the wrath of God. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with
fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
and over his mark, <i>and </i>over the number of his name&hellip;  </p>

<p>So, first of all, these seven messengers got the victory
through Christ.  They are going to be the seven who pour out the seven last
plagues in Revelation 16, which identifies with this five-month period.  This
is also speaking of all those whom God saved.  The rest receive the &ldquo;mark of
the beast.&rdquo;  They end up worshipping his image and they end up drinking of the
cup of His wrath.  </p>

<p>Let us also take a look at few verses dealing with the cup. 
We read in Psalm 75:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">For in the hand of JEHOVAH <i>there is </i>a cup, and the wine
is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs
thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring <i>them </i>out, <i>and </i>drink
<i>them.</i>  </p>

<p>Jeremiah 25 refers to this cup.  We read in Jeremiah
25:15-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith JEHOVAH God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup
of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink
it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I
will send among them. Then took I the cup at JEHOVAH'S hand, and made all the
nations to drink, unto whom JEHOVAH had sent me:<i> To wit, </i>Jerusalem, and
the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make
them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as <i>it is </i>this
day;  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to refer to many nations.  Then we read in
Jeremiah 25:28-29:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith JEHOVAH of hosts; Ye shall
certainly drink. For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by
my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I
will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith JEHOVAH of
hosts.</p>

<p>So God began with Jerusalem, which points to the churches. 
They drank for 23 years, and it was all spiritual.  We know this for certain
because God&rsquo;s wrath was poured out on the churches and congregations as He
removed Himself and as He removed salvation from them and as He set up Satan;
and yet they were drinking of the cup.  Then He says that the rest of the
inhabitants of the world will also drink of this cup.  </p>

<p>We should not think that this would be any different,
because it will be spiritual.  It is the spiritual fire and brimstone.  It is
the removal of salvation and the removal of God&rsquo;s people in sowing seed upon
the land in the world.  </p>

<p>There is one other place in the New Testament to look at in
relation to this in Matthew 26.  I think that this is mentioned twice and then
referred to a third time.  This is when Jesus was in the garden of Gethsemane. 
We read in Matthew 26:39:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless
not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt.</i>  </p>

<p>He prayed this three times, &ldquo;Let this cup pass from me,&rdquo; the
cup of judgment, the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath.  </p>

<p>So Psalm 11:6 says again:   </p>

<p class="verse">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone&hellip;  </p>

<p>And this is the portion of their cup.  </p>

<p>Revelation 14 speaks of the wicked, the unsaved, who are
given the cup of God&rsquo;s anger and that they are tormented; and we know that this
torment will last for five months, not for ever and ever and ever.  We read in
Revelation 14:10 that they are:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy
angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:  </p>

<p>Notice this language: </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;in the presence of the <span class="underline">holy</span> angels&hellip;  </p>

<p>We just went over the word &ldquo;angel.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; is the
word &ldquo;messenger.&rdquo;  It was context that determined how the translators
translated this word as either &ldquo;angel&rdquo; or as &ldquo;messenger.&rdquo;  Here, they thought
that obviously when judgment occurred that it would not be upon the earth, and
so it would be in the presence of angelic beings.  This is what the translators
must have thought and this is why they translated this as &ldquo;angels.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But they are called &ldquo;the holy angels,&rdquo; so let us look at
this word &ldquo;holy&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 6.  This word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; we know could be
&ldquo;messenger,&rdquo; so this could be referring to &ldquo;holy messengers,&rdquo; but we find out a
little bit more of how this word &rdquo;holy&rdquo; is used here.  This word for &ldquo;holy&rdquo; is <i>hagios</i>
in the Greek.  This is either translated as &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or as &ldquo;saints.&rdquo;  We read in
1 Corinthians 6:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
before the unjust, and not before the <span class="underline">saints</span> [<i>or the holy ones</i>]? 
Do ye not know that the <span class="underline">saints</span> shall judge the world? and if the world
shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  </p>

<p>So here God is very definitely letting us know that the
saints are these holy ones or those Corinthians or they are you, the true
believer.  You are going to judge the world; but not only the world, because
look at verse 3, 1 Corinthians 6:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things
that pertain to this life?  </p>

<p>One of the last plagues that the seven angels or messengers
pour out is poured out &ldquo;upon the seat of the beast.&rdquo;  We know that the &ldquo;man of
sin&rdquo; took his seat to rule, and these seven angels or messengers are pouring
out a plague on that seat of the beast.  Now we know how and why, because he
has lost his official rule by God.  God stripped this from him, and he is no
longer ruling in the churches.  </p>

<p>This judgment of God falls directly on an angel, the fallen
angel Satan, and he now is deposed.  He is put down.  The language of the Bible
says that he is dead.  This is one of the judgments that come at this time; and
so we are not only judging the world, we are judging angels, too, Satan and his
evil minions, the demons, which are just fallen angels.  </p>

<p>Remember that they were afraid of torment.  They said to
Jesus, &ldquo;Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?&rdquo;  Very definitely,
God is tormenting Satan and the fallen angels, and this torment upon Satan must
be great because he is so proud.  He is so, so proud and he was proudly sitting
upon his throne.  </p>

<p>Remember Haman the adversary to the Jews and how proud he
was whenever the king would lift him up and give him a little authority and
power.  This perfectly pictures Satan, as even Haman was called &ldquo;the
adversary,&rdquo; which is the name for Satan.  This is where the name of Satan comes
from in the Hebrew.  </p>

<p>So here God tells us that the saints will judge the world. 
Now look at Ephesians 5.  We are still looking at the word &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; which is
also translated as &ldquo;saint&rdquo; oftentimes.  We read in Ephesians 5:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
not be once named among you, as becometh <span class="underline">saints</span>;  </p>

<p>And we read in 1 Thessalonians 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all
his <span class="underline">saints</span>.  </p>

<p>He is coming with the saints.  </p>

<p>Another very familiar verse is Jude 1:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his <span class="underline">saints</span>,  </p>

<p>This is the completeness of His saints, 200 million of His
saints.  He is judging the world.  He is coming in judgment with the
completeness of all of His elect.  He is pouring out fire and brimstone, the
cup of wrath for all of the unsaved people, in the presence or right before the
face of His holy or saintly messengers, the holy angels, and &ldquo;in the presence
of the Lamb.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Of course, God is everywhere, and so He does not have to be
in Heaven for Him to judge mankind.  He does not have to be in Heaven because
He is everywhere present, and He is judging the world presently.  </p>

<p>Every time we listen to Family Radio and we do not hear what
we have been hearing for years, we should recognize that this is honoring and
glorifying God, because it would go contrary to God for anyone to start trying
to indicate that people could still be saved.  No; not when there is fire and
brimstone falling.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Matthew 25.  Matthew 25:31 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
angels [<i>saintly messengers</i>] with him, then shall he sit upon the throne
of his glory:  </p>

<p>This is an important phrase.  </p>

<p>Let us now go back to Matthew 19.  This will explain to us
who the &ldquo;holy angels&rdquo; are.  We read in Matthew 19:27-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when
the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  </p>

<p>Christ sits upon &ldquo;the throne of his glory.&rdquo;  Who are these
&ldquo;holy angels&rdquo;?  They are the disciples and all of God&rsquo;s people.  Remember that
they are seated also &ldquo;in heavenly <i>places </i>in Christ Jesus&rdquo; to judge the
&ldquo;twelve tribes,&rdquo; which would be a reference to the churches.  </p>

<p>This is what is going on right now.  We are just sharing
what God is teaching in His Word, and it is a judgment upon &ldquo;the twelve tribes
of Israel,&rdquo; upon the corporate body and the churches of the world.  </p>

<p>Let us go to one last verse.  Going back to Matthew 25, the
&ldquo;holy angels&rdquo; are with the Son of Man and He is seated &ldquo;upon the throne of his
glory,&rdquo; and then we read in Matthew 25:32-33:  </p>

<p class="verse">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his </i>sheep from
the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the
left.  </p>

<p>We are presently feeding sheep.  God right now is setting
goats on the left and the sheep on the right.  This is because He intends to
feed the sheep, while the goats are coming under His wrath.  The believers are
there with Him, these 200 million whom God has saved, those whom God has
loosed; and yet God has not sent forth in any way to bring a message of
salvation, because it is over.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
