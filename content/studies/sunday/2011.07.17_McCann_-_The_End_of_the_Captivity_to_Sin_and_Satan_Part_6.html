<p>For a few weeks, we have been studying the idea of the
release of those whom God intended to save and did save.  Then it all finally
came to pass before Judgment Day, May 21.  God released all elect captives,
completely, all of them.  </p>

<p>We have also been talking about how God speaks, how He wrote
the Bible in parables.  As Jesus spoke, we read, &ldquo;Without a parable spake he
not unto them.&rdquo;  He is the Word, and so we know that He is teaching us that
this is how we have to understand everything in the Bible.  </p>

<p>We have also seen how difficult it is, even for true
believers, to decipher and to understand what the Bible says.  We have the
example of when Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees,&rdquo; and they took it to mean that He was referring to bread, that it
was something physical.  Christ corrected them, &ldquo;Do ye not yet understand?&rdquo; 
Then they learned that this was actually a spiritual reference to the doctrine
of the Pharisees and the scribes.  </p>

<p>This is how God wrote the Bible in just about every place,
but there are occasions where God hides truth and yet His statement is very
direct and very straightforward.  For example, Jesus told the disciples several
times the things that He must suffer and then after three days rise from the
dead.  Luke 18 tells us that they understood &ldquo;none of these things&rdquo; and that it
was &ldquo;hid from them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We wonder how the disciples could not know when Jesus said this
plainly in Luke 18.  We read in Luke 18:31-33:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he took <i>unto him </i>the twelve, and said unto them,
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets
concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For he shall be delivered unto
the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</p>

<p>This is Christ telling the disciples what was going to
happen.  Did all of these things literally happen?  Yes; they did.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they shall scourge <i>him, </i>and put him to death: and the
third day he shall rise again.  </p>

<p>Was Jesus whipped and put to death?  Yes; and it was all
very physical.  </p>

<p>Then look at what we read in verse 34, Luke 18:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.  </p>

<p>We have this common expression where something just sails
right over our heads, which is like what happened to these disciples.  Why did
they not get this?  </p>

<p>We know that man can be pretty dense, especially natural man,
concerning the truths of the Bible.  But these were true believers mostly,
except for Judas.  We would assume that the other eleven were all true
believers.  And Christ told them pointblank and straightforwardly what was
going to happen, but they did not understand.  </p>

<p>We can probably see why, because every time Jesus would say
something, or on most occasions, like with the leaven, they would be corrected
that they were not to take it literally and that they were to look for the
spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>But now He is saying these things and we can see them
thinking and maybe even discussing what these things meant.  &ldquo;What does He mean
by being spitted on, spitefully entreated, whipped, and dying?  What are the
spiritual meanings of these things?&rdquo;  And so, they were confused.  </p>

<p>We read in Luke 24:44-46:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, These <i>are </i>the words which I spake
unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in </i>the prophets, and <i>in </i>the
psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might
understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it
behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:  </p>

<p>Now they understand.  Now they completely get what Christ
was telling them.  </p>

<p>This is kind of cheating, is it not, because this is after
the fact?  This is after He was spitted on.  It was after He was spitefully
entreated and scourged and died and rose from the dead that Jesus tells them this
again; and now they get it.  They understand.  </p>

<p>This is how it is sometimes.  This is how it is.  There is
no humanly possible way that any person who studies the Bible can know
something, a truth, if God does not want them to know it.  There is no way.  He
will blind people to spiritual things if they take it literally; and sometimes
He will say something literally and we might be thinking spiritually.  </p>

<p>So the Bible is complex and difficult.  This is why we
compare spiritual with spiritual, then we try to harmonize our conclusions, but
then we also have to go to God in prayer and say, &ldquo;O Lord, help me to
understand.  Open my eyes that I might behold wondrous things out of Thy Law. 
Give me spiritual understanding of these things.&rdquo;  Then if this is God&rsquo;s will,
He does.  </p>

<p>Now we are after the fact of May 21 and there was not a
great physical earthquake, but when we follow these two words, the &ldquo;great
earthquake&rdquo; that we read about in Revelation 6 and in Revelation 16, we would
not know from these passages if it was to be literal or spiritual.  We would
not know.  </p>

<p>In this case, God did not want us to know until it
happened.  After it happened, then we could know, like we know today.  And if
this is God&rsquo;s will, like it was with the disciples concerning His rising from
the dead after three days, then who are we to say anything about this?  </p>

<p>So these two words, &ldquo;great earthquake,&rdquo; are also in Acts 16
where there is a prison.  Paul and Silas are thrust into the inner part of it
and they are securely bound in this prison and the prison doors are shut.  Then
a great earthquake happens, but nothing apparently happened to the city of Philippi. 
The next day, the magistrates who threw them into prison and had them whipped
send a messenger to go and release Paul and Silas.  </p>

<p>If there had been a great earthquake in the city of Philippi,
they would not have been interested or even concerned at all about releasing
Paul and Silas from the prison.  Nothing is said about the city falling down
and crumbling.  When you read Acts 16, even the prison itself did not fall. 
There apparently was no damage.  The walls did not fall.  The ceiling did not
collapse.  The only thing that the great earthquake did was open prison doors
and take off the bonds of every prisoner, all of them.  God makes a point of
stressing this.  </p>

<p>So we have these ingredients; plus the earthquake happened
towards midnight, and midnight has to do with Judgment Day.  But before this,
Paul and Silas were praying and praising God, and all of the prisoners heard
them.  This is spiritually important because we know that God sent the Gospel
into all the world so that all the world would hear.  All of His elect had to
hear in order to be delivered, in order to be freed.  </p>

<p>It is just an amazing thing that we have these words &ldquo;great
earthquake&rdquo; in view with the release of the prisoners from Acts 16.  And this
just so happens to have everything to do with just about the whole Bible,
because God likens sinners to being in prison.  </p>

<p>We can look at Isaiah 42:7, Isaiah 61:1-2, 2 Timothy
2:25-26.  </p>

<p>Isaiah 42:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, <i>and </i>them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.  </p>

<p>Isaiah 61:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The spirit of the Lord JEHOVAH <i>is </i>upon me; because
JEHOVAH hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me
to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
opening of the prison to <i>them that are </i>bound; To proclaim the acceptable
year of JEHOVAH, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that
mourn;  </p>

<p>And 2 Timothy 2:25-26 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And <i>that
</i>they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken
captive by him at his will.  </p>

<p>Look at these verses where God is looking at sinners in
prison.  </p>

<p>We have not looked at this one yet.  Let us also go to 1
Peter 3.  1 Peter 3:18-20 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit: By which also [<i>that is, by the Spirit</i>] he [<i>Christ</i>]
went and preached unto the spirits in prison; Which sometime [<i>aforetime</i>]
were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
Noah, while the ark was a preparing&hellip;  </p>

<p>Before the flood, Christ preached, but who were these
mysterious spirits in prison?  He preached to the people of the world of that
day, to those who saw Noah constructing the ark.  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us that Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of
righteousness.&rdquo;  Christ is righteousness, so Noah preached Christ; and this how
Christ preached.  He preached through His servant Noah, just like He has
preached to the world all throughout history through His servants.  But notice
how God says that He went and preached to &ldquo;spirits in prison.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you are not saved, woe unto you now because you are going
to stay this way.  Woe unto you.  This is the time when if you are filthy,
which has to do with sin, the Bible says that you will be &ldquo;filthy still.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what it says in Revelation 22:11.  We read in
Revelation 22:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book: for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still:
and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.  </p>

<p>The Book was unsealed, which God did in 1988 but not
completely.  He did not completely unseal this until May 21.  Now, in its
aftereffects, we are learning more.  We are learning more things, a lot more. 
There is another great amount of information that God is revealing to His
people now.  </p>

<p>So if you are spiritually in prison now, and any unsaved
person is, you are going to remain spiritually in that prison, because there is
no more deliverance.  The thing is, though, we do not know whom God did free
and whom He left bound, and so we continue praying for our family members and
for our friends, maybe even for ourselves.  Of course, the prayer is not, &ldquo;O
God, save me.  Have mercy on me today.&rdquo;  No; the prayer is, &ldquo;O Lord, could You
have saved me before May 21 and maybe I do not know this?  May You work out
that salvation with me now in these days.&rdquo;  And so we are basically praying, &ldquo;O
Lord, having had mercy, have mercy,&rdquo; because this was a past action.  This
action was already taken by God, and then He shut the door to Heaven, which was
what we were seeing.  </p>

<p>We had focused on this and had warned people about this as
we told them, &ldquo;The door is shutting.  There will be no more salvation.&rdquo;  We
were correct as we told them, &ldquo;The door to Heaven is closing on May 21, which
will be Judgment Day.&rdquo;  And then we were also correct that there would be this
five-month period.  This was what we were warning people about, but we did not see
these other aspects to this.  Yes; the door shut, but then all of the doors of
all of God&rsquo;s elect all over the world opened.  They opened and God set all of
the captives free.  </p>

<p>This is what I want to take a look at today in relation to
the Babylonian captivity.  Remember that we have to look for the deeper
spiritual meaning.  We have to look for parables.  When we read about the Jews
in Babylon, that was true history.  It was not a parable as in when Jesus would
speak a parable and say, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like&hellip;&rdquo;  This was a
historical parable; that is, what happened was all full of meaning, of types
and of figures and of spiritual truths.  </p>

<p>This is like we read in Job 27:1, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover Job continued his parable&hellip;  </p>

<p>Job was a real man and he really suffered those things.  But
in that suffering, God painted a picture of the Gospel and that was the
parable.  </p>

<p>In Galatians 4:21, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?  </p>

<p>Then it speaks about historical occurrences in the book of
Genesis with Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, and their children.  </p>

<p>Then, incredibly, God says in Galatians 4:24:</p>

<p class="verse">Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants&hellip;  </p>

<p>The two wives of Abraham and their two sons were an
allegory; that is, they had a deeper meaning.  This is why verse 21 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;do ye not hear the law?  </p>

<p>This is like when Christ would say, &ldquo;Who hath ears to hear,
let him hear.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>These are similar statements to make sure that we understand
what God is saying, because we have to look for the deeper meaning.  We have to
find the Gospel truth, and this is what God is saying here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;do ye not hear the law?  </p>

<p>Then He refers, not to Deuteronomy or to the Ten
commandments, He refers to history; because the whole Bible is a Law Book.  But
not only should we learn the historical events; that is, we could, by memory, tell
you what Abraham did with Hagar, as Sarah gave her handmaiden to him.  We
should not only learn just this, but do we not hear what the Law is pointing
to, to the shadows, to the figures, to the types?  </p>

<p>Look also at Psalm 78.  It says in Psalm 78:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give ear, O my people, <i>to </i>my law: incline your ears to
the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark
sayings of old:  </p>

<p>Again, God makes reference to the Law.    </p>

<p class="verse">O my people&hellip;incline your ears&hellip;  </p>

<p>Give ear; this means to hear this.  Do not just read it.  We
can just read the story of Joseph or we can just read the story of Joshua. 
These are very interesting stories.  Many preachers read them today and say,
&ldquo;What can we learn to benefit us in the way that we live our lives?  What
morals can we glean from these accounts?  What important truths do they contain
to help us to live the Christian life?&rdquo;  Alright; fine, fine fine, but then
they stop &ndash; and they did not hear the Law.  They did not hear it.  Where is the
Gospel?  </p>

<p>Family Radio has taken so much abuse for the way in which
they approach the Bible, because none of the churches approach it in this way;
and yet the Bible is just full of examples of how we should approach the Bible,
which is exactly the way in which Family Radio has been doing for over 50
years.  We should be looking for spiritual meaning, looking for truths.  </p>

<p>Here is one in Psalm 78.  When we just read this, it has to
do with the release from Egypt and the wilderness sojourn.  Remember that it
says in Psalm 78:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
old:  </p>

<p>But when we read this Psalm, this is a historical account;
it is history.  It is the history of Israel.  But this account is not like the
rich man and Lazarus.  That is only a parable, because they were not real men. 
They typified real men, but they were not, themselves, real men.  Here in Psalm
78, this is real, actual history; and look at verse 51.  We read in Psalm
78:51:    </p>

<p class="verse">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their </i>strength
in the tabernacles of Ham:  </p>

<p>When did this occur, or what time of day or night?  This
occurred at midnight.  God smote all of the firstborn of Egypt at midnight; and He is telling us that this was a parable.  This was a parable.  There is spiritual
meaning there.  </p>

<p>This is just like the great earthquake in Acts 16.  It was a
true earthquake, for all we know, but a very strange earthquake.  It was also a
very great earthquake.  It was not like just a little tremor on the Richter
scale.  This was a great earthquake, a <i>megas seismos</i>, but it did not do
any damage.  And God can do this if He wants.  </p>

<p>But, of course, there was a plague in Egypt and the death of
the firstborn.  This plague passed by the Jews, because they had the blood on
their doorposts.  This really happened.  These things took place.  But then
notice what we read in Psalm 78:52-53.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock. And he led them on safely, so that they feared
not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  </p>

<p>Okay.  There was a great earthquake that we identify with
May 21 and the release of captives.  In Egypt, we can say that there was a
great earthquake at midnight.  As a result of this, all of the slaves are set
free.  </p>

<p>It actually says in Exodus 12 that &ldquo;in that night&rdquo; they were
delivered, because Pharaoh rose up hastily.  Every house in Egypt had death,
from Pharaoh on his throne to the captive in the dungeon.  Pharaoh lost at
least one son.  We do not know how many wives he had, and I do not know how God
figured that event, but we do know that he lost at least one son.  </p>

<p>Many died in Egypt on that night.  As a result of that
tremendous shaking of Egypt in the death of their firstborn, it released all of
the slaves, all of the Jews, at once, immediately.  Pharaoh got up and said,
&ldquo;Go; get you out,&rdquo; and all of the Egyptians were with him.  They quickly wanted
them out.  They gave jewels of gold and silver to the Jews.  In other words,
the Jews spoiled them because this was a victory.  This was a victory, and to
the victor go the spoils.  </p>

<p>So they were going out and they started heading out at
night.  But with over 600,000 footmen, it was, of course, whatever time it must
have been after midnight when they got started and continued going out the next
day into the daylight until they were all gone; and so then they left Egypt.  </p>

<p>Now this relates to May 21.  Notice how God just says in
this parable that He &ldquo;made his own people to go forth,&rdquo; they were free; and
they went forth &ldquo;like sheep.&rdquo;  And where are we at?  </p>

<p>Do you remember John 21?  We read there of the great catch
of 153 fish, and 153 just so happens to be the number of days from May 21 to
October 21.   153 fish are brought to Jesus and the next thing that happens is
that Jesus says to Peter, &ldquo;Peter, lovest thou me?&rdquo;  Peter replied, &ldquo;Lord; thou
knowest that I love thee.&rdquo;  This went back and forth three times.  After Peter
would say this, then Jesus would say, &ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the picture here.  It is midnight, it is judgment, all of the captives are freed, and God leads them &ldquo;forth like sheep, and
guided them in the wilderness like a flock.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is not a mistake when you go to Family Radio&rsquo;s webpage (<a
href="http://www.familyradio.com/">www.familyradio.com</a>)
and you see what?  You see Bible verses on feeding sheep, because this is where
we are.  We are in the 153-day period, and we have come out of Egypt, in a
sense, like all came out.  Not one Jew remained behind, no matter how young or how
old, not a single Jew.  All of the captives were released.  All of them were
freed; and so God released all of His people on May 21.  </p>

<p>So it is important that we hear the Law and that we look for
the spiritual meaning.  Then we come to Babylon and the king of Babylon.  We
will turn to Isaiah 14 in a minute.  </p>

<p>First, when we told people that the church age was over and
that the Bible said, &ldquo;Let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains,&rdquo; the
people in the churches did not understand this.  They would say that God was
talking to the people in the first century A.D.  They would say things like,
&ldquo;He is just referring to the Jews of that time because there was that horrible
tribulation when the Roman army came in 70 A.D. and destroyed them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No; they missed the spiritual meaning.  Christ is speaking
and &ldquo;without a parable spake he not unto them.&rdquo;  For example, Matthew 24 speaks
of &ldquo;let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains.&rdquo;  In the previous
verse to this, it speaks of &ldquo;when ye therefore shall see the abomination of
desolation&hellip;stand in the holy place,&rdquo; and then it says to &ldquo;flee into the
mountains.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We understand that Judaea spiritually represents the
church.  We understand that the mountains represent God and His Word.  And
fleeing has to do with coming out of the church.  </p>

<p>There is nothing unusual about this understanding according
to the Bible, because this is how we interpret the Bible.  But this is
extremely unusual if you are in a church.  This will be extremely strange to
your ears if you are a Catholic or a Baptist or a Presbyterian or an
Episcopalian, because you do not interpret the Bible this way.  Sadly to say,
this is true.  This is true.  You have your own methods of interpretation
according to your denomination.  How ever it is that your denomination has
determined to approach the Scriptures, you allow for some parables, as long as
the New Testament explains them.  If it is like the allegory in Galatians 4,
then you will permit this.  </p>

<p>There is a mountain of evidence that can be given to show
how the Bible was written and how Christ spoke in parables.  It is enormous and
you would think that at some point people would realize, &ldquo;Hey, I had better
hear the Law.  When I am reading the Old Testament or anywhere in the Bible, I
had better have my ears open to hear what the deeper meaning is.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we are going to talk about Babylon, we have to find the
deeper meaning; and so let us go to Isaiah 14 and I will read from verse one. 
It says in Isaiah 14:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">For JEHOVAH will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
and set them in their own land&hellip;  </p>

<p>Judah and Canaan, in this case, would typify Heaven, the
Promised Land.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall
cleave to the house of Jacob. And the people shall take them, and bring them to
their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of JEHOVAH for
servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they
were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Babylon and Satan.  God&rsquo;s people now
take Babylon captive.  This is really what God is saying.  The power and
authority that God gave Satan to rule in the churches and congregations is
done.  It is done.  May 21 was the end of that judgment on the house of God. 
It was the end of the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Remember that God called Nebuchadnezzar &ldquo;my servant&rdquo; in
order to accomplish the destruction of Judah.  God utilized Satan and gave him
official rule in the churches.  For example, take a look at Revelation 13 where
&ldquo;power&rdquo; is given &ldquo;unto the beast,&rdquo; and &ldquo;power&rdquo; is the same worth as
&ldquo;authority.&rdquo;  How long was this given to him?  It was &ldquo;given unto him to
continue forty <i>and </i>two months,&rdquo; which is another way of saying that it
was for the duration of the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>So he was given authority for 42 months, but not after.  He
was given authority for the 23-year period that we just went through, which was
8400 days, but not after.  And maybe we will get a chance to look at what comes
after and what God says about this, but let us keep reading here.  </p>

<p>It says in Isaiah 14:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in the day that JEHOVAH shall give
thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein
thou wast made to serve.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of today.  This is why we are to stop
crying.  When we read the Bible and we read of the Israelites coming out of Egypt,
it was not long after that they were murmuring.  </p>

<p>What do we think about this?  They were constantly
murmuring.  They murmured over food, over water, over this and that, over who
Moses was, over who Aaron was.  They would ask, &ldquo;Are we not all servants of the
Lord?&rdquo;  They complained and complained and complained.  They gave no glory to
God at all.  They were in constant misery.  Moses had to keep going to the Lord
because the Lord would want to destroy them.  </p>

<p>Of course, they were not saved people.  This is how unsaved
people act.  Historically, we know that the Gospel was preached to them; but
only a handful actually entered into the land of Canaan because of their
murmuring after they went to search out the land after the spies brought back
an evil report.  God is very observant and He takes note when His people are
complaining.  </p>

<p>What was the problem?  The problem was that they did not
realize that God had just brought enormous plagues upon Egypt, that they had
been slaves there, that they had been under cruel bondage with hard taskmasters
over them.  He had just brought Egypt to its knees, the greatest nation on
earth and He caused Pharaoh, that hard-hearted man, to let them go, to release
them.  And how long did it take them to start complaining?  It was not long. 
It was only a couple of days after coming out.  </p>

<p>Well, we can look back to May 22<sup>nd</sup>.  Actually, we
can look back to May 21<sup>st</sup> in some cases with some of those who were
professing to understand and believe the Bible.  They decided to put all of
this away from them and to not listen to Family Radio anymore.  There was a lot
of murmuring and complaining by certain individuals.  And I think that God&rsquo;s
people were a little confused and wondered what was going on; but some of those
who really were not God&rsquo;s people, their colors were shown.  </p>

<p>So here, we can relate this to our being delivered
spiritually from hard bondage; again, this is what is in view.  There is a
release of the captives.  This is such an incredibly major theme of the Bible,
and our release from captivity is the theme for these five months.  </p>

<p>Again, Isaiah 14:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in the day&hellip;  </p>

<p>And then Isaiah 14:4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon&hellip; 
 </p>

<p>Again, a proverb is a parable, and we take this up &ldquo;against
the king of Babylon&rdquo;; but we could not have taken this up prior to May 21,
because we did not know this.  However, now we can take up this proverb
&ldquo;against the king of Babylon&rdquo; because we know it and because God is showing us what
is happening and what is going on.  </p>

<p>Then Isaiah 14:4 continues on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!   
</p>

<p>Satan would be the &ldquo;oppressor&rdquo; and the &ldquo;golden city&rdquo; would
be Babylon.  They ceased oppression.  </p>

<p>Isaiah 14:2 said:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they shall take them captives, whose captives they were&hellip;    </p>

<p>And so we have the 200 million who were bound in the great
river Euphrates in Babylon.  They were captives, and God looses them from their
captivity on May 21.  They then go forth like locusts into the world.  200
million people are out there.  There are 200 million who have just been set
free and who are all the people of God.  And these 200 million are in all of
the nations of the world.  </p>

<p>They are everywhere and they are going to learn the truths
of the Bible, and many of them have.  As they share them, if anyone asks them,
they will say, &ldquo;There is no more salvation.&rdquo;  This is a sting like a scorpion,
because a scorpion has to do with false gospels and false gospels have no
salvation.  </p>

<p>So these locusts are going forth en masse.  They are just
living their lives, and God will make this known to the rest of the world in
His own ways.  </p>

<p>I just wanted to come to Isaiah to show what it says here in
Isaiah 14:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;take up this proverb [<i>or parable</i>] against the king of Babylon&hellip; 
</p>

<p>Here, Babylon is spoken of as a parable or a proverb.  </p>

<p>So we need to understand this 70-year period, but I do not
want to go into all of the proofs that are already out there in Mr. Camping&rsquo;s
books.  He shows how we can look at certain historical time periods and how
they are historical types of the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>For example, we know about the 7-year famine in Joseph&rsquo;s
day.  This is translated as &ldquo;great affliction&rdquo; in Acts 7, but these are the
same two words for &ldquo;great tribulation&rdquo; that we read about in Matthew 24.  </p>

<p>We also know that the 23-year period from 609 B.C. to 587
B.C., inclusively, was a figure of the 23 years that we just went through.  And
we also know that there was a 70-year period from 609 B.C. to 539 B.C. when Judah
became a desolation.  This is when the Babylonians came against them, destroyed
them, took them captive, destroyed the temple, and brought them to Babylon. 
They went to Babylon in captivity, and that typified this 70-year period.  </p>

<p>The number 84 has a lot to do with the great tribulation. 
We read of three and a half days in Revelation 11.  This is how many hours?  It
is 84 hours.  The seven years of famine in Joseph&rsquo;s day is how many months of
famine?  It is 84 or 7 x 12.  The 70 years from 609 B.C. to 539 B.C. is how
many months of desolation?  It is 840 or 70 x 12.  And so this number 84 has a
lot to do with the great tribulation and is a helpful indicator when we are
looking at something.  We can ask, &ldquo;What period does this identify with?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We just went through 23 years from May 21, 1988 to May 21,
2011.  How many days was this?  It was 8400 days, and so the 8400<sup>th</sup>
day was May 21.  We see 84, 84, 84.  </p>

<p>There was one other 84 that really locks in the 70-year
period to our present day.  Let us go to Ezekiel 1 and I will read the first
couple of verses.  It says in Ezekiel 1:1-2:</p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,
</i>in the fifth <i>day </i>of the month, as I <i>was </i>among the captives by
the river of Chebar, <i>that </i>the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of
God. In the fifth <i>day </i>of the month, which <i>was </i>the fifth year of
king Jehoiachin's captivity,  </p>

<p>Family Radio has some very great books, like the <i>The
Perfect Harmony of the Numbers of the Hebrew Kings</i> and <i>Adam When?</i> 
Mr. Camping has really been blessed by God, as God opened up his understanding,
to really outline the whole timeline of history, from creation, which was
11,013 B.C., all the way down.  We have this record in the book <i>Adam When?</i>
and Mr. Camping has done some work on the period of the judges and on the
period of the kings.  He has done a chronology of the kings, which is exact and
trustworthy.  You can see this if you go through it.  And so I am going to use
some dates.  </p>

<p>We have a short time left and a lot of information.  We have
a lot of information concerning this day that we are living in.  This
information is out there and this has never been disputed and this has never
been proven wrong.  Those chronologies are correct.  They are correct and they
can be trusted.  The dates fit too perfectly for any of the dates to be off.  </p>

<p>In the chronology of the kings, we read about Jehoiachin and
this captivity.  King Jehoiachin was one of those kings during that last
23-year period before the destruction of Jerusalem.  He went into captivity and
was taken into captivity in 598 B.C.  Ezekiel is talking about the fifth year
of King Jehoiachin's captivity, which would be 593 B.C.  </p>

<p>What does this have to do with anything?  Look at Ezekiel
1:1 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,
</i>in the fifth <i>day </i>of the month&hellip;  </p>

<p>So this thirtieth year identifies with the fifth year of
King Jehoiachin's captivity.  What is this thirtieth year connected to?  God
does not tell us here.  Actually, we will see what this is connected to, but
this is the only reference made to it.  It must have been very important for
God to join it with the chronology of the kings.  The fifth year of King
Jehoiachin, which was 593 B.C., was this thirtieth year of something unnamed.  </p>

<p>Jehoiachin was taken captive in 598 B.C.  Since we go back
to 593 B.C., the fifth year of Jehoiachin, we then go back these 30 years. 
When going B.C. dates, we count backwards.  This can twist your brain a little
bit.  </p>

<p>So at 593 B.C., go back 30 years, and we would think that we
would land on 623 B.C.  Actually, 623 B.C. or 622 B.C. would both work, but I
think that this would be 622 B.C. and that it would be inclusive.  </p>

<p>I have trouble with some numbers, so how I do this is that I
just write down the years, as in 622, 621, etc.  Then you can count one, two,
three, etc., and mark what year is the fifth year and what year would be the
thirtieth year.  And so when we go back, it would be 622 B.C., which was during
the reign of King Josiah.  </p>

<p>Let us go to 2 Chronicles 34:1.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Josiah <i>was </i>eight years old when he began to reign&hellip;  </p>

<p>Are there any young people here who think that they have it
tough or that they have too much to do?  How would you like to be a king at age
eight?  </p>

<p>So Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and
then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.  </p>

<p>How old was Josiah when he died?  He died at the age of 39. 
No numbers in the Bible are insignificant.  This number, if we were to break
this down, would be 3 x 13.  </p>

<p>By the way, I have said this before, but maybe some people
who are listening have never heard this before.  But breaking down numbers is
Biblical.  For example, you can look in the book of Revelation and see where it
talks about 12 gates and 12 foundations, etc.  Then God actually breaks these
down and says, &ldquo;On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south
three gates; and on the west three gates.&rdquo;  This is 4 x 3, which adds up to
12.  </p>

<p>So God does this in the Bible, because it maintains the same
meaning, but He also does this in history.  There was a reformed theologian by
the name of A. W. Pink who was pretty well respected in the reformed
community.  He died in 1952.  Family Radio did not begin until 1958.  And so
Pink had already taught this years before and died before Family Radio began
and before Mr. Camping began to teach on the air.  </p>

<p>So Pink was reading something in Exodus.  He came to
something that mentioned months that had numbers involved.  Then he broke them
down, much like we do.  He had some of the same similar meanings, but a couple
were slightly different.  What does this tell us?  </p>

<p>The only reason I mention this is that the method of
breaking down numbers did not originate with Mr. Camping.  A reformed
theologian much earlier than him had already been using this, and I doubt that
A. W. Pink was the first.  </p>

<p>In other words, God, of course, is the teacher of His
people, and, more than likely, in past history, God&rsquo;s people did this.  But I
do not have the time and I know that you do not have the time to go searching
church history to find out who else did this.  For those who believe that they
have the truth and are reformed, the name of A. W. Pink will perk up their
ears.  He was a very faithful theologian for his time.  </p>

<p>So here we have the number 39.  Josiah was 39 years old when
he dies, which is 3 x 13.  As we examine the Bible, just like for any other
thing, how does God use the number 3?  How does He use the number 13?  </p>

<p>We find that 3 has to do with purpose and that 13 has to do
with the end of the world.  This is one way of putting this, as 1988 was the
13,000<sup>th</sup> year of earth&rsquo;s history.  The great tribulation began in
that year.  Judgment began at the house of God and then transitioned to the
world on May 21<sup>st</sup> of this year, and so forth.  </p>

<p>So judgment began in the 13,000<sup>th</sup> year, and here
is Josiah, the last good king of Judah.  He began to reign in 640 B.C.  He
reigned 31 years to 609 B.C.  Then he was killed in battle with the Egyptians. 
From that point on, God removed all blessings from Judah.  Then it was not long
after that before the Babylonians and King Nebuchadnezzar came and finally
destroyed the temple.  They took the vessels and the silver and the gold into
Babylon and they took captives back to Babylon.  </p>

<p>So here is Josiah who began to reign in 640 B.C.  Now look
at 2 Chronicles 34:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the
land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the
governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the
house of JEHOVAH his God.  </p>

<p>The eighteenth year of his reign would be 622 B.C. or 623
B.C.  This is because the kings of Judah could reign according to accession or
non-accession.  I forget exactly which one it is; but, again, this does not
matter because 622 B.C. would be inclusive and 623 B.C. would just be exact. 
This does not matter.  It is one of these two years and I believe that it is
622 B.C.  </p>

<p>This would be the eighteenth year of Josiah, and Josiah
wanted to repair the house of God.  This was a good thing, but was this major
enough for God to keep track of this all of the way to the thirtieth year of
the days of Ezekiel?  Well, no, not really.  </p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that in Josiah&rsquo;s eighteenth
year &ndash; and he was eight when he began to reign &ndash; how old was he?  He would have
been 26.  Broken down this is 2 x 13.  He was not 27 and he was not 29.  He was
26, which is 2 x 13.  Again, we see an emphasis on the number 13.  This is
happening because God is trying to use these numbers to direct our attention to
13,000 years of history.  </p>

<p>We are not going to read all of this, but in 2 Chronicles
34:14-16, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
house of JEHOVAH, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of JEHOVAH <i>given
</i>by Moses. And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found
the book of the law in the house of JEHOVAH. And Hilkiah delivered the book to
Shaphan. And Shaphan carried the book to the king&hellip;  </p>

<p>Somehow, the Book of the Law was lost.  Remember what God
asks, &ldquo;Do ye not hear the law?&rdquo;  The whole Bible is the Law of God.  And so we
can understand that they lost the Bible.  They misplaced it in the house of the
Lord.  </p>

<p>We might laugh, but has anybody here lost their Bible?  You
do not know where it is and you have to look for it when you want to read it
occasionally.  This is not a good thing.  </p>

<p>The churches have lost the Bible, even though they have them
in great numbers.  You can also lose the Bible when you do not know where truth
is, when you do not know what God is saying in His Word.  And this is the
condition of the churches today.  </p>

<p>So the Book of the Law was lost; it was completely lost. 
But the important thing here is that it was found.  Hilkiah finds the Book of
the Law, and then they give it to King Josiah, the most faithful king that
Israel or Judah ever had.  Even though he was a young man, when they read this
to him, he &ldquo;rent his clothes.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then Josiah brings all of the nation together so that they
can hear the words of the Law.  Then a great revival began where they cast out
all of their idols.  Josiah was very zealous.  He wanted to do things God&rsquo;s
way.  He was fully a man of God who wanted to do things His way.  </p>

<p>Well, in 1988 when the great tribulation began, God opened
up the Scriptures.  He took the seals off; and even though we have had these
Bibles all through history, we never understood them.  </p>

<p>So in 1988, God basically gave us the Bible.  And over the
last 23 years and now just a little bit more, we have been learning truths from
the Bible that have never been known before.  </p>

<p>Again, we see the number 13 in Josiah&rsquo;s age.  He was 26. 
Thirteen years from this point, he will die at age 39; and so God is breaking
things up and emphasizing the number 13 in order to help us understand that we
find the Bible when God opens up the seals.  He did this in 1988 and this has
been continuing up until this time.  </p>

<p>Now, this is something that we would want to keep track of. 
They found the Bible.  Thirty years later, Ezekiel is moved by God to make this
reference.  There is nothing else that happened in the eighteenth year of
Josiah that would really be significant enough.  But they found the Book of the
Law, the Bible; and God is keeping track by telling us of the thirtieth year,
which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity.  And so 593 B.C. is thirty
years from the finding of the Bible.  </p>

<p>What if we kept counting down?  God does not do this for
us.  He only gives us one reference.  In the other references in Ezekiel, you
will find phrases like &ldquo;the fourteenth year&rdquo; or other references to certain
years.  In one place, it says, &ldquo;in the fourteenth year after that the city was
smitten,&rdquo; and things like that.  </p>

<p>So there is no other reference anywhere in the Bible to the
finding of the Book of the Law, but this is enough because it gives us the date
when the Book of the Law was found, it gives us the timeframe of thirty years
later, and so we understand that 593 B.C. was the thirty-year mark.  </p>

<p>If we continue on to 539 B.C., what is this?  This is the 70<sup>th</sup>
year.  In 609 B.C., Josiah is killed.  In 539 B.C., 70 years later, this is the
end of the Babylonian rule and the release of the captives.  In 539 B.C., the
king of Babylon is slain.  </p>

<p>If you remember, this is when God came and wrote with His
finger on the wall, and nobody could interpret this.  But then the queen comes
in and says, &ldquo;There is a man, oh king, in your kingdom and he interpreted
dreams for your father, Nebuchadnezzar.&rdquo;  At this point, Nebuchadnezzar had
probably been the grandfather or great-grandfather, because Nebuchadnezzar had
been long dead.  </p>

<p>So Daniel comes in to read the writing on the wall, but he
did not need to go to God like he did in former times to petition God, &ldquo;O Lord,
what does this mean?&rdquo;  This is what happened with Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. 
Daniel does not need to do this at this time.  He is just simply able to
interpret this right away.  </p>

<p>Let us turn there to Daniel 5.  It says that the king of
Babylon wanted to make Daniel a great man for interpreting the writing on the
wall, but Daniel tells him to just keep it.  Then we read in Daniel 5:24-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
was written. And this <i>is </i>the writing that was written, MENE, MENE,
TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This <i>is </i>the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.  </p>

<p>This is said twice, because something doubled means that it
is shortly going to come to pass.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Daniel 5:27-29:  </p>

<p class="verse">TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. Then
commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and <i>put </i>a
chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he
should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>

<p>But Daniel had told them to keep their gifts, because he
understood that this kingdom was at an end.  What good would it do to be made
the third ruler in the kingdom of a kingdom that was coming to an end?  </p>

<p>Then we red in Daniel 5:30-31:  </p>

<p class="verse">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
And Darius the Median took the kingdom, <i>being </i>about threescore and two
years old.  </p>

<p>This happened at the end of the 70 years.  The death of the
king of Babylon or the conquering of the kingdom of Babylon happened very
quickly, like &ldquo;a thief in the night.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>They had been partying and drinking from the vessels of the
temple, the vessels of gold and silver.  They were having a big party. 
Belshazzar was there with a thousand of his lords.  It did not seem that they
were concerned about the approach of the Medes and the Persians.  It was almost
as if they did not know anything about this.  </p>

<p>The army of the Medes and the Persians would have had to
have been huge in order to conquer Babylon, because Babylon was a great
nation.  And so how could this huge army approach them?  Where were their
watchmen?  </p>

<p>We can ask this same question of the churches.  Where were
your watchmen?  How could God come and take your kingdom of Babylon and you not
even know it?  But He did.  He came like &ldquo;a thief in the night&rdquo; and He took the
kingdom of Babylon.  </p>

<p>So where is Satan today?  Well, when one king conquers
another king, he puts his foot on his neck.  This is really one way that we
could look at this.  This is like the king of Babylon being slain,
historically, after 70 years.  This king was not the cause of trouble in Daniel
6 when Daniel was thrown into the den of lions.  That was not because of the
Babylonians.  It was actually Darius who did this, and Darius loved Daniel.  He
loved Daniel and he did not want to do this; but out of necessity, because the
law of the Medes and the Persians could not be changed, he did cast him into
the lions&rsquo; den.  </p>

<p>But we should not think that because we have come to the end
of the great tribulation and to the end of the rule of the king of Babylon,
which we have done, that everything is going to be a bed or roses in relation
to Satan.  Daniel was still in Babylon, but the Babylonians were not ruling
Babylon &ndash; and we are still in the world.  Daniel was in Babylon and under the
rule of Darius who is the same person as Cyrus.  </p>

<p>And what does God call Cyrus?  He calls him &ldquo;my shepherd.&rdquo; 
A shepherd takes care of sheep.  Again, we see the destruction and the end of
the 70 years and then we see the good shepherd Cyrus taking care of the sheep.  </p>

<p>We are going to stop here and have a word of prayer.  </p>

<p><i>Dear Father, we do thank You for this wonderful
information.  We thank You for how we had this all wrong.  We thought that we
were silenced.  We thought that somehow it had been a mistake, an error, that
we did something wrong; and yet this was all perfectly according to Your plan. 
No one has silenced us.  It is You who has removed the great commission in one
way, because we no longer have to warn the world in order that they might be
saved.  This is all finished and done.  Father, we pray that You would help
us.  We pray that You would feed us.  We know that You will.  You will search
out Your sheep and protect and feed them.  We pray for all of those people out
there in the world, all those out there in India and in China and in Africa and
in South America, wherever they are.  We pray that You would comfort them and
feed them and bless them more and more.  May You also continue to bless us
here.  Father, we pray that You would help us in all things today to keep our
thoughts on things above and to do Your will.  We pray these things in Christ&rsquo;s
Name.  Amen.  </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
