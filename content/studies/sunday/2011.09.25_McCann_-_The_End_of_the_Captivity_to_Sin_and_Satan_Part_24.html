<p>We were looking at the idea of one new moon to another and
one Sabbath to another that we find in Isaiah 66.  Isaiah 66:22-23 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
shall remain before me, saith JEHOVAH, so shall your seed and your name remain.
And it shall come to pass, <i>that </i>from one new moon to another [<i>new
moon</i>], and from one sabbath to another [<i>sabbath</i>], shall all flesh
come to worship before me, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the new heaven and new earth.  This is
referring to eternity.  </p>

<p>Does this mean in eternity that things are going to be like
this life where we have one out of seven days to worship?  In eternity, are we
going to worship God like we do here on Sundays?  </p>

<p>This is not the way that God describes the new heavens and
the new earth.  He speaks of dwelling with His people in their presence
forevermore.  </p>

<p>Remember what we read in Revelation 21.  This is a beautiful
chapter that describes the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the Bride of Christ or the
elect of God.  Revelation 21:22-26 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb <i>is </i>the
light thereof. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. And
the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night
there. And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.  </p>

<p>Here in this temple, the gate would shut at nighttime, but
there is no night.  This means that the gate is perpetually open.  </p>

<p>This is the explanation of what we read in Ezekiel 46.  This
speaks of &ldquo;the prince&rdquo; and this is a figure of speech for Christ.  We read in
Ezekiel 46:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of <i>that </i>gate
without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare
his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the
threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut
until the evening.  </p>

<p>But there is no night, so evening never comes.  </p>

<p>This is a similar statement to what we read in Isaiah 65
where God says that &ldquo;the child shall die an hundred years old.&rdquo;  This does not
make sense, except for the fact that God is indicating that a hundred-year-old
infant just cannot be because He is emphasizing that there is no end to life.  </p>

<p>So, too, if it were possible for night to come, then God
would shut the gate.  But once He opens that gate to let His people in, which
He is going to do on October 21, then the gate of Heaven, that glorious holy
city, the New Jerusalem with the Lord Jesus as the temple, will always be
open.  It will always be day.  This is when day and night cease because &ldquo;day
and night&rdquo; is a time reference that ends with this world.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in Ezekiel 46:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
this gate before JEHOVAH in the sabbaths and in the new moons.  </p>

<p>So here again we see that we are going to worship the Lord
&ldquo;in the sabbaths and in the new moons.&rdquo;  Isaiah said &ldquo;from one sabbath to
another&rdquo; and &ldquo;from one new moon to another.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The Sabbath ended on May 21, that Sabbath that covered the
great tribulation period.  The new moon ended because the moon went dark.  The
Bible tells us, &ldquo;Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun
be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.&rdquo;  The moon went dark.  The
next time that the moon will come again, the new moon, will be October 21.  </p>

<p>I think that maybe a verse in Colossians 2 will help us to
understand this.  We read in Colossians 2:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath <i>days:</i> Which
are a shadow of things to come; but the body <i>is </i>of Christ.  </p>

<p>Everything in this world is a shadow, all of the laws, all
of the sacrifices.  The ceremonial laws and the feasts, all of those things
typified Christ who is the substance of all of those things.  </p>

<p>So when the one new moon ends, which it did when the moon
went dark on May 21, then when Christ comes, He is the substance of the new
moon and this will be an eternal new moon.  This will be an eternal fulfillment
of what the new moon represented.  </p>

<p>It is the same thing with the Sabbath.  The Sabbath pointed to
rest in Christ, as it says in Hebrews 4:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works
were finished from the foundation of the world.  </p>

<p>Christ is the essence of the Sabbath.  We enter into His
rest.  He did the work to save His people.  When He comes, this will be the
substance that the Sabbath has always pointed to.  It will be the eternal
Sabbath rest because we will go into Heaven itself.  </p>

<p>This is why Isaiah is making this statement and this is why
Ezekiel 46:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; The gate of the inner court that
looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath
it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.  </p>

<p>The substance of these things will be fulfilled at Christ&rsquo;s
coming.  The shadows pointed to this.  When He comes, the gate opens.  The
seven messengers, who are fulfilling one last duty, pour out the vials of the
seven last plagues.  Then that is it.  </p>

<p>Once this is complete, the implication in Revelation 15 is
that they enter back into the temple, or that man can then enter into the
temple.  Since all of the unsaved will be gone at that point and it will be
over for them, then it can only be the true believers who will enter back in.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Revelation 15.  We read in the last verse
of Revelation 15, Revelation 15:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven
plagues of the seven angels [<i>messengers</i>] were fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Then we read in the next chapter, Revelation 16:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels [<i>messengers</i>], Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath
of God upon the earth. And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the
earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the
mark of the beast, and <i>upon </i>them which worshipped his image.  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;noisome&rdquo; is a word that is normally translated as
&ldquo;evil&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; and so this is an &ldquo;evil&rdquo; thing. The word &ldquo;grievous&rdquo; is also
translated as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or &ldquo;wicked.&rdquo;  And so there is a strong emphasis here that
this is not good.  This is about as bad as it gets.  This is an evil, wicked,
sore judgment that is being poured out.  </p>

<p>If we think about this, if we really think about this, it is
far worse to remove the possibility of salvation than anything that could
happen physically.  This is worse than anything physical that could be done to
people.  To take away the hope of salvation, to remove that Day of Salvation
and for God to say that this is over and that there will be no more salvation
is a horrible thing.  This is an evil thing.  </p>

<p>When God causes a hurricane or an earthquake, He says that
He creates evil.  So, too, this is an evil thing.  This is a very grievous sore
upon the men who had the mark of the beast.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;sore&rdquo; is found twice in Revelation 16 and this is
also found in Luke 16 with the rich man and Lazarus.  I do not think that this
is found anywhere else.  It says in Luke 16:19-21:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,  </p>

<p>Here is that word.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich
man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  </p>

<p>This is a parable and Lazarus is representing a child of
God.  He is picturing true believers, but he has sores and desires to be fed
with the crumbs from the rich man&rsquo;s table.  In other words, he is being
afflicted and his desire for just the crumbs of these riches is not being met. 
</p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in Luke 16:22-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in
hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom.  </p>

<p>By the way, this word &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; is plural here.  The first
&ldquo;bosom&rdquo; is singular.  This second &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; should have been translated
&ldquo;bosoms.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my
tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that
thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.  </p>

<p>God is looking first at Lazarus who had a difficult life. 
He had a hard time.  He had sores during his days on the earth; but now the
rich man who had an apparently easy and comfortable life is being tormented and
he is now the one desiring something.  He just wants a drop of water.  </p>

<p>What does water represent in the Bible?  It represents the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>So the big point of this parable is, &ldquo;If only I could have a
little bit of hope of salvation, because I am in torment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is not a coincidence.  It is intentional that God is
laying this out, because we are in five months of torment according to
Revelation 9 where we read of there being no hope of the Gospel for someone to
become saved.  </p>

<p>The rich man wants just a little drop of water.  Is it
possible?  The answer is that no, it is not.  There is &ldquo;a great gulf fixed,&rdquo; and
so this is an impossibility.  This is the judgment of God.  There is no mercy
because there is no more salvation.  </p>

<p>God uses the sores of Lazarus and then contrasts it with the
rich man who then winds up in torment, and I think that we can relate this a
little bit to what is going on in Revelation 16.  Those upon the earth are now experiencing
an evil and a sore judgment that has come upon them.  This is basically the
same thing that came upon the rich man.  He was given no water and no hope of
God bestowing His grace anymore if he was not already saved.  </p>

<p>It says again in Revelation 16:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had
the mark of the beast, and <i>upon </i>them which worshipped his image.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Revelation 13, we read about the image to
the beast in verse 14 and following.  It says in Revelation 13:14-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by <i>the means of </i>those
miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them
that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had
the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the
image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause
that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  </p>

<p>This would be the churches who have the ability to speak. 
They can communicate.  </p>

<p>The problem today for people is that these churches, even
though they claim to be the church of Christ, were under the authority of Satan
during the great tribulation and they are filled with emissaries of Satan. 
They come looking like Christ, like they have the Gospel, and yet they do not. 
</p>

<p>This is that image that Satan wanted people to worship. 
This is because if people believed that God was there and if they bowed down to
that, if he was able to deceive them like he had been able to deceive Adam and
Eve, he would receive the worship.  This was what was going on for the 23-year
great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Revelation 13:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And
that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the
beast, or the number of his name.  </p>

<p>The mark in the hand is just language indicating that
someone&rsquo;s will is owned by Satan, because the hand represents the will.  This
is why Jesus said, &ldquo;If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.&rdquo;  Stop the way you are
going.  </p>

<p>Here, the mark is &ldquo;in their right hand, or in their
foreheads.&rdquo;  Their forehead is where their mind is, and so this is indicating
an individual&rsquo;s mind or their spirit or soul is owned by Satan.  </p>

<p>Who would this be referring to?  This would be every unsaved
person, every unsaved individual in the world.  If someone is unsaved at this
point, there are no more elect to save.  </p>

<p>These individuals have received a &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; but there is no
literal mark.  I know that some people get mixed up by this and try to find
answers to the Bible by looking at literal solutions to verses, but they always
end up being wrong.  This is a spiritual mark that cannot be seen and it just
indicates that a person is owned by Satan.  This mark is mentioned in
Revelation 16.  This is the &ldquo;grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of
the beast,&rdquo; which is every unsaved person.  </p>

<p>So God is going to make a distinction.  First of all, there
are five months of torment on all of the world, on every unsaved individual. 
Secondly, this is also &ldquo;<i>upon </i>them which worshipped his image,&rdquo; which
goes back to the image of the beast in the churches.  In particular, this is
the judgment that comes upon the churches and congregations.  They receive more
stripes as they were immediately slain as soon as we moved into the five-month
period, and there is absolutely no hope for them.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in Revelation 16:3-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
became as the blood of a dead <i>man; </i>and every living soul died in the
sea. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of
waters; and they became blood. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou
art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast
judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast
given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. And I heard another out of the
altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i>are </i>thy
judgments.  </p>

<p>So the water is being turned to blood and blood has to do
with judgment, just like the moon turns to blood that we read about in a couple
of places during this time.  This is a spiritual reference.  </p>

<p>If we go to the ocean or to the river, we do not see any
blood literally.  But the way that God is looking at this, this is referring to
all of the waters of the earth, not just a third part of the waters.  </p>

<p>The third part of the waters were turned to blood in
Revelation 8.  We read in Revelation 8:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became
blood; And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life,
died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.  </p>

<p>This third part is typifying the church.  God judged them.  </p>

<p>What was this judgment that turned their waters to blood? 
It was the removal of His blessing, the removal of His Spirit, the removal of
salvation from the churches, even though they did not know this.  They probably
heard that Family Radio was teaching this.  They more than likely heard this
and were very annoyed about the fact that Family Radio was teaching the end of
the church age and that God&rsquo;s people should come out.  </p>

<p>And why was Family Radio teaching this?  They were teaching
this for the people&rsquo;s own benefit, because the waters were turned to blood and
they could not drink them.  All of the Gospel waters in every church and in
every denomination across the face of the earth turned to blood.  This is what
happened to the third part during the great tribulation.  But outside of those
churches, the waters had not been turned to blood because God was sending forth
the latter rain.  </p>

<p>We know that Family Radio went into all the world in a great
way.  God&rsquo;s people carried the Gospel outside of the church and there was a
tremendous blessing on this witness of the Word of God.  But at the same time,
the waters of the church were turned to blood.  </p>

<p>Revelation 16:3 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
became as the blood of a dead <i>man; </i>and every living soul died in the
sea.  </p>

<p>The difference here is that this does not say that this
occurred only on the third part of the sea.  It is just says &ldquo;the sea.&rdquo;  This
is because this judgment has expanded.  </p>

<p>We knew this.  We knew that judgment began at the house of
God and that this judgment was for 23 years.  Then we knew that judgment would
transition.  </p>

<p>You can read Jeremiah 25 where God tells us that He will
begin this at Jerusalem and then He will judge all of the other nations.  We
actually have a very clear example of God&rsquo;s judgment on the church here.  </p>

<p>We thought that this would be spiritual.  But then when He
turned to the world, we mistakenly thought that that would be much more
physical.  But, no; this judgment is actually the same thing.  </p>

<p>This is why He uses the same language.  The church&rsquo;s waters
turned to blood, because God left them to themselves.  Whether they knew this
or not, they just went through great tribulation.  They had no salvation.  No
one who remained in the church received any blessing for those 23 years.  </p>

<p>Now, for five months, whether people know this or not and
whether people are aware of this in the world is not the point.  God&rsquo;s judgment
is much more gentle than we would ever think.  He judged the church and, to
Him, this was a horrible thing.  </p>

<p>Look at the language of Jeremiah and look at much of the
language of the Bible.  Look at His weeping over the fact that He pronounced that
awful judgment upon the congregation, which just boiled down to His Holy Spirit
leaving and Satan entering in.  And now, He has left the world in the sense
that there is no more salvation for the world; there is no more blessing.  </p>

<p>This is as it says in Revelation 18, and I want to read this
so that we understand exactly what I mean by saying that He left the world. 
This verse is referring to Babylon, which typifies the world.  It says in
Revelation 18:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>We read this in the past and thought that this meant that
Christ left, because He is the Bridegroom, and that He took the believers, the
Bride.  We thought that this meant that we would physically leave the world. 
But, no; this is very similar to what we read in Amos 8 where it says that
there is a famine of hearing in the land, and this applied to the church.  </p>

<p>Here, this is saying &ldquo;the voice,&rdquo; which is the Word of God,
of Christ the Bridegroom and of the Bride, as we would carry that Word, &ldquo;shall
be heard no more at all.&rdquo;  This is because it takes God to open up the ears. 
The Bible tells us that &ldquo;faith <i>cometh </i>by hearing, and hearing by the
word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But here we are.  We did not go anywhere.  God is still
everywhere present.  He is still omnipresent.  He has not left in that sense, but
He has removed the ability for man ever again to hear the Word.  If He did not
hear by May 21, he is never going to hear ever again.  The voice will never be
heard, which is what He is referring to here as &ldquo;the light of the candle.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God can use the small example of putting out the light of
the Gospel like a candle or He can use a very big example and refer to the sun
itself and say that the sun will be darkened.  He is saying the exact same
thing.  He will put out the light of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Going back to Revelation 16, we read in Revelation 16:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the fourth angel [<i>messenger</i>] poured out his vial upon
the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And men were
scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over
these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>

<p>This is unusual.  This is out of place almost because we
keep reading about darkness: the darkening of the sun, the darkening of the
moon, the falling of the stars.  Actually, even in Revelation 16:10, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for
pain,  </p>

<p>Spiritually, the world is dark.  But now, God introduces the
sun; and not only the sun, but a scorching sun that is able to produce great
heat.  As a result of this heat, men blaspheme the name of God and do not
repent.  </p>

<p>We were just talking about this a little bit at lunch.  On
May 21 and for the few days thereafter in May and for a couple of weeks into
June, things got pretty hot, did they not?  Things got pretty hot and we were
not imagining that.  We were not imaging that.  Spiritually, this is a
scorcher.  This is the way that God speaks of this time and He does this in
many places.  </p>

<p>Let us look at 1 Peter 1:6-7.  By the way, I am waiting for
someone to ask when we are ever going to get back to 1 Peter, because we
started in 1 Peter in this Bible study and have never made it back.  Now, we
are back to 1 Peter.  We read in 1 Peter 1:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: That the trial of your faith,
being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with
fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
Christ:  </p>

<p>This speaks of a trial of faith by fire.  This is not an
uncommon idea in the Bible.  This is the same idea that we see in 1 Corinthians
3.  I will read several verses so that we can see how this fits.  Actually,
this fits with what we were talking about before with the temple actually being
living people.  It says in 1 Corinthians 3:9-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <i>ye
are </i>God's building. According to the grace of God which is given unto me,
as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.
But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can
no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon
this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every man's
work shall be made manifest&hellip;  </p>

<p>Just to define this work, look at 1 Corinthians 9:1.  God is
moving Paul to write this.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?  </p>

<p>He is speaking to the Corinthians and saying, &ldquo;Ye people,
are ye not my work in the Lord?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Now return to 1 Corinthians 3.  We read in 1 Corinthians
3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Every man's work shall be made manifest&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;manifest&rdquo; means that something is revealed to be
exactly what it is.  This is because what was the problem all through history? 
It was the difference between the wheat and the tares.  You could not tell a
wheat from a tare.  You could not tell a true child of God from someone who was
just really covering it up because they were their same old self with no change
in their heart at all.  </p>

<p>Yet it says again in 1 Corinthians 3:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
declare it&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the Day of Judgment.  We are in Judgment
Day.  This is Judgment Day.  This began on May 21 and this continues for five
months or 153 days.  Since this day is declaring this, we should be seeing
evidence of who the true people of God are and who are not.  </p>

<p>Many of us can be fooled so easily.  Just because somebody puts
on a hat and a shirt, we think that they are our brother and our sister.  But
that is not a brother or sister.  If someone carries a sign, that is not a
brother or sister.  It was the same sign that we carried, yes; but a real
brother or sister is what God has to make.  He is the only One who can make
this.  </p>

<p>This actually began right on May 21, did this not?  This was
almost instantaneous with some people.  They began to immediately distance
themselves from Family Radio and from Mr. Camping, from anything to do with
this.  It was within a week that I think I heard from people who had all been
onboard prior to May 21 that we were liars, that we were false prophets, that
everyone should turn off Family Radio and never turn it on again.  Within one
week, this was going around in many places.  </p>

<p>But thank God that He has His people and that they were
carrying signs and they were wearing hats and they were wearing shirts and
handing out tracts.  But not everyone that did these things were His people.  </p>

<p>This particular vial that we are reading about in Revelation
16 is not targeted so much at the church; actually, not at all.  This is
targeting those who had identification with the true Gospel outside of the
church.  </p>

<p>Let us finish reading 1 Corinthians 3:13 and then we will go
back to Revelation 16.  1 Corinthians 3:13 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every
man's work of what sort it is.  </p>

<p>There are so many verses that we could go to.  Remember that
when the Lord Jesus is revealed from Heaven, He comes taking vengeance.  We
read in 2 Thessalonians 1:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels [<i>messengers</i>],  </p>

<p>Again, this is God&rsquo;s people judging the world with Him.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:  </p>

<p>This began when Judgment Day began.  This is the time of
fire and brimstone, of &ldquo;flaming fire,&rdquo; of scorching heat.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in 1 Corinthians 3:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward.  </p>

<p>This would be referring to a true child of God who is going
to come through like gold.  He will be purified.  This is what Daniel said.  He
said, &ldquo;Of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to
make <i>them </i>white, <i>even </i>to the time of the end.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then it says in 1 Corinthians 3:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he
himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.  </p>

<p>The one who will be saved is the true believer who brought
the message.  This individual was His Work.  This work is a person, but this
work is burned up if the person is unsaved because they turn out to be wood,
hay, and stubble and not gold, silver, and precious stones, not someone who was
truly one of God&rsquo;s elect.  </p>

<p>Going back to Revelation 16, we read again in Revelation
16:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And men were scorched with great
heat&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;scorched&rdquo; is found twice here in Revelation 16
and only two other times in the New Testament.  They are in parallel parables. 
It is found once in Matthew 13 with the parable of the sower.  We read in
Matthew 13:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and
forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the
sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered
away.  </p>

<p>This is one place.  The other place is in Mark 4:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: But when the sun
was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.  </p>

<p>These are the only other two places where we find this word
&ldquo;scorched.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;heat&rdquo; in Revelation 16 is related to this word,
but the word &ldquo;scorched&rdquo; itself is found twice in Revelation 16 and once in
Matthew and once in Mark.  In both cases, it has to do with the parable of the
sower throwing the seed, which is the Word of God.  This is what Christ goes on
to explain about this parable.  And this seed lands upon the hearts of men.  </p>

<p>This is what God&rsquo;s people did all through history.  They
threw the seed out there.  It landed where it may.  Then God gives the
illustration in this parable of the different types of ground that this seed
landed on.  In this case where it landed on ground that wound up being
scorched, this is because it fell on &ldquo;stony ground.&rdquo;  There was no depth and no
deepness for it to take root.  </p>

<p>We understand that when you sow seed in your garden, you
cannot sow this on a rock.  This is because when the sun gets hot, there are no
roots.  The roots were not able to get deep enough in order to strengthen the
plant to survive.  </p>

<p>Isaiah 11 defines the root for us.  We read in Isaiah
11:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse&hellip;  </p>

<p>Christ is the root.  If there is no root because there is no
deepness of earth, this is the problem.  This is completely the problem.  Jesus
is not indwelling that person.  And it did not matter how they responded to the
Gospel.  It did not matter how joyfully and how happy they were.  Any of that
type of response did not matter.  The problem was that it could not penetrate
beyond a heart of stone, a heart that is deceitful and desperately wicked. 
That seed landed on that type of heart, but Christ was not in that heart and so
there was no growth.  </p>

<p>Turn to Mark 4.  Jesus explains this parable.  He would do
this occasionally to help us in understanding how He wrote the Bible.  We read
in Mark 4:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; And have
no root in themselves&hellip;   </p>

<p>People heard about May 21 maybe two years ago.  Maybe they
heard about this one year ago.  Maybe they only heard about this two weeks
before May 21.  We have to remember that this was all over the place.  This was
on the television.  People saw this as they drove down the road on billboards. 
There were seemingly people everywhere pestering people with tracts.  </p>

<p>It was everywhere, and there would be an individual who
somehow had identification with the Gospel.  They would be looking at this, and
no one could deny that this was certainly along the lines of what Christ would
want His people to do.  We were told, &ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel,&rdquo; and here were these people doing this boldly.  This had a certain
attraction.  Plus, they were talking about an end of the world very definitely
and very certainly, and this had an awful lot of attraction.  </p>

<p>Why is it that so many people go to those ladies with their
crystal balls or who read their horoscopes or who call into those psychic
hotlines, all of those types of things?  People want to know the future.  They
want to know their future.  </p>

<p>So here were people who were predicting the future, and what
we had really was a lot of people who joined up.  A lot of people joined up. 
Some joined up further back.  Some joined up a little closer as it got nearer
and nearer.  A lot of people joined up and it was not hard for people to join
up.  We were shoveling out the shirts.  They were on the back table. All we had
to do was ask people if they wanted a shirt.  We did not have any questionnaire
for people to fill out.  We were not trying to find out where people stood
spiritually.  </p>

<p>God forbids that at this time.  We have no one in authority
checking people as to whether they are truly a child of God or not.  This was a
matter for the authority in the church.  Nobody does this now, and so it was
very easy for people to join up.  </p>

<p>We would say that we were going downtown with a caravan,
etc.  We would speak of going overseas.  With those who were interested in
going overseas, we did try to make sure that that was an individual who was
believing like we were.  But if they wanted to go downtown with us to hand out
tracts, who was to stop them?  </p>

<p>So a lot of people got shirts.  A lot of people got hats.  A
lot of people got signs.  They were right with us outwardly, but not where it
counted.  This is because inwardly they did not have that root.  They did not
have that root at all.  </p>

<p>I think that this parable had application all through
history, but we can make this connection now because God is the One who is
using this word &ldquo;scorched&rdquo; that is found twice in Revelation 16 and that is
only found elsewhere in this parable of the sower.  And so He is putting His
finger on something that relates to the Day of Judgment, to the day of fiery
trial, like it said in 1 Peter.  </p>

<p>In Mark 4, we also read about the sun.  It goes on to say in
Mark 4:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
immediately they are offended.  </p>

<p>We experienced affliction leading up to May 21, but it was
minor.  People called us names or they ripped up a tract, which was very minor
stuff.  Yet in addition to this, there was the comfort of having so many people
with us.  There was all of this interest that the world was showing in the
Gospel for it seemed like the first time in history.  All kinds of things were
making it very exciting to continue on in doing that.  </p>

<p>But then it did not happen like we thought.  There was no
great earthquake.  There was no resurrection physically of the dead.  There was
no rapture of the living on May 21.  Immediately, mocking was taking place.  </p>

<p>I had been talking about the ten days of May, from May 21 to
May 31, and the first couple weeks of June, because they were not pleasant.  It
was a very uncomfortable time and I really had the feeling that people were
looking at me.  It was as if they knew.  In my neighborhood, they definitely
knew.  Little kids would even come up to me and ask, &ldquo;Why did that not
happen?&rdquo;  Little tiny children would ask me this.  </p>

<p>The heat was turned up.  The heat was turned up like never
before.  And any kind of previous affliction or tribulation that we have
experienced for the Word&rsquo;s sake was nothing in comparison to this beginning of
the five months.  It really kind of made me and others, too, wonder what these
five months was going to hold before we began studying this and realized that
we could relax.  </p>

<p>We could relax.  We could settle back.  We needed to
remember that we were sheep and that we have a Good Shepherd watching over us
and protecting us; and this is how this has turned out.  It has quieted down. 
Nobody hardly says anything.  We do not hear a peep from the church.  </p>

<p>Where is the problem coming from?  The problem is coming
from those who were wearing hats and shirts and signs.  Why?  This is because
they were offended.  They were offended.  </p>

<p>They are angry, they are very upset, they are embarrassed,
and this is not good.  Jesus said, &ldquo;For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of
my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
glory.&rdquo;  But they will say, &ldquo;Oh, I am not ashamed of the Word of God.  I am
ashamed that we proclaimed something that was not true.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is not the reason why the heat has been turned up.  It
was God&rsquo;s plan all along to accomplish two things.  He intended to lay a snare
for all of the world and for Satan.  At the same time, He intended to try His
people.  God wanted us to misunderstand this.  I know how this sounds, but God
is not responsible for our errors.  All He has to do is to leave us to
ourselves.  Believe me; we can misunderstand all by ourselves.  He wanted us to
misunderstand in order that He could bring about this time of a scorching sun,
this time of raising affliction and tribulation for all those who brought the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>His people will make it through.  They are not going to be
burned up.  They are not going to be destroyed.  But unfortunately for others,
the problem is that there is no root.  The problem is that Christ is not within
their hearts.  </p>

<p>Lord willing, we will maybe try to finish up with Revelation
16 and look at the great river Euphrates being dried up.  God is leading us
into this chapter and it could be that He is preparing us for the coming day
when He will take His people from this world into the next.  This has been
typified and pictured by the crossing of the Red Sea and by the crossing of the
  Jordan.  He also mentions later in Revelation 16:12 about the river drying
up.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
