<p>Turn to Esther 3.  We will probably go into chapter four and
maybe even a little bit into chapter five.  Today, if possible, I would like to
lay out how Esther ties into May 21 and how it locks in.  I would like to lay
out how this locks in.  This is not just a light thing.  It locks in.  </p>

<p>Since Esther locks into May 21, this will help us to
understand what happened on May 21, which was Judgment Day.  Also, once it
locks in, then the Feast of Purim takes on an entirely new light.  We would
necessarily have to look at this in a different way.  </p>

<p>We need to remember the spiritual chronology in the book of
Esther.  In chapter one with Vashti, we have national Israel as she typifies Israel. 
Then she is put away as God put away Israel in 33 A.D.  </p>

<p>Then in chapter two, there is the gathering of virgins to
Shushan.  We saw how that during the New Testament period as the Gospel went
out into the world, it typified the looking for the Bride of Christ and that
God typified those who came in as foolish and wise virgins.  In several places,
He identifies virgins with those who came into the churches.  </p>

<p>Then at the end of chapter two, we have the two doorkeepers
who were rebels.  They were caught, exposed, hung, and made an open shame. 
This pointed to the end of the church as the church came under the judgment of
God, just as those two men came under the judgment of King Ahasuerus; and then
the church age ended.  </p>

<p>Chapter three immediately begins with the advancement of
Haman, with his promotion, which was pretty much in conjunction with the death
of the doorkeepers.  This is because this depicts the end of the church age,
and what did God do then?  He loosed Satan.  </p>

<p>Then Ahasuerus promotes Haman&rsquo;s seat above all of the
princes, just as Satan took his seat in the temple as the &ldquo;man of sin.&rdquo; 
However, Mordecai refuses to bow down; and Revelation 13 gives us the
information about the beast that comes up out of the sea.  At the time of the
great tribulation, an image is made to the beast and all who will not bow down
should be killed.  </p>

<p>So Mordecai was to be killed.  That was what Haman wanted to
do.  All of the people of Mordecai were to be killed also.  </p>

<p>We can see how chapter one identifies with Israel, how
chapter two identifies with the New Testament church age, how chapter three
identifies with the great tribulation.  It then progresses and actually moves
on in a very orderly way.  </p>

<p>This is why I said that this is a spiritual chronology.  It
is giving the history of God&rsquo;s salvation plan, and then it gets to the point of
the end of the church age and God&rsquo;s judgment on the churches with the
advancement of Haman.  Then Haman goes to King Ahasuerus and buys the Jews, and
the king sells them into Haman&rsquo;s hands.  It is said a couple of times in Esther
that the king sold them.  Esther said this to King Ahasuerus, &ldquo;For we are sold,
I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had
been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue.&rdquo;  This is why she
went before the king.  </p>

<p>We looked at Judges 4:2 last time.  Let us look at this
again.  This kind of language is found a few times in the book of Judges.  We
read in Judges 4:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of
JEHOVAH, when Ehud was dead. And JEHOVAH sold them into the hand of Jabin king
of Canaan&hellip;  </p>

<p>There again, God&rsquo;s people, Israel, do evil and God sells
them.  </p>

<p>What did this mean?  It meant that He turned them over; He
gave them up.  He put them into possession; because if you buy something, it
becomes yours.  It becomes your possession.  </p>

<p>So God sold His people into the enemy&rsquo;s hands because of
their rebelliousness.  This is exactly what God did during the great
tribulation when He loosed Satan.  When He turned over the churches and
congregations to him, He placed them in his hands, &ldquo;Do with them as you will.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Well, I want to destroy all the Jews.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Go to it&rdquo; is basically what God
said.  </p>

<p>At the beginning of the great tribulation, where were God&rsquo;s
people?  Those who heard the Gospel were those who primarily were going to
church.  We were in the churches when God handed them over into Satan&rsquo;s hands
back in 1988.  We did not hear about the end of the church age until about 2000
or 2001, and so the church is where we were.  </p>

<p>We do not see this laid out in Esther.  Historically, King
Ahasuerus seems to have no concern for the Jews at all; but we know that God
has a great concern for His elect.  He knew that not one of them would ever
perish.  That is not possible.  But He wanted to allow Satan to do this.  That
was His plan in order to destroy and bring judgment on the churches.  Satan,
from his perspective, wanted to kill all of the elect.  This is why he brings
false gospels that have no salvation in them.  If people actually believe them,
they will be destroyed.  </p>

<p>So King Ahasuerus sells the Jews into Haman&rsquo;s hands, and
then it says in Esther 3:12-13 that the scribes are called on the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded
unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that <i>were </i>over every
province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the
writing thereof, and <i>to </i>every people after their language; in the name
of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring. And the
letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces&hellip;  </p>

<p>There were 127 provinces, which typified the whole world;
and these letters were carrying a message of judgment and that there was a set
date for the destruction of the Jews.  </p>

<p>These letters were basically killing, which reminds us of 2
Corinthians 3:6 that says, &ldquo;For the letter,&rdquo; referring to the Bible,
&ldquo;killeth.&rdquo;  This sending forth of these letters sealed with the king&rsquo;s ring
identifies with the Word of God, the Bible, as information goes out into all of
the world and is published to all of the people.  </p>

<p>Look at Esther 3:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that
day.  </p>

<p>Does this sound familiar?  Where else do we find something
like this in the Bible?  The only thing that I think comes close is Caesar&rsquo;s
proclamation that all of the world would be taxed.  That had to do with his
kingdom and all of the nations under him and that everyone would be taxed; but
in the book of Esther, it is definitely identifying with what God said in
Matthew 24:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what is going on in Esther.  It is preached
to 127 provinces and published to all people, and what was it concerning?  It
was concerning the end of the Jews, a set date, a time when they were to be
killed.  </p>

<p>We can see how this relates to May 21, but, of course, the
date here was not May 21.  It was the 13<sup>th</sup> day of Adar.  But let us
look at this spiritually and see what the people were hearing.  The Jews, the
elect who are in all of the world today, are in every nation; and these Jews in
the 127 provinces heard the date that would be of the 12<sup>th</sup> month and
the 13<sup>th</sup> day.  </p>

<p>The number 12 in the Bible relates to the fullness of
whatever is in view.  Fullness, in this case, is the fullness of time, because
it had to do with time.  We have seen repeatedly that the number 13 in the
Bible has to do with the end of the world.  1988 was the 13,000<sup>th</sup>
year of earth&rsquo;s history and the time of the end.  </p>

<p>So this actually related to the Jews as well as to all of
the people in all of the provinces, because this was published in all of the
provinces.  Not only the Jews heard this but everyone who was not a Jew also
heard a message of judgment that would come, spiritually, in the fullness of
time and that it would involve the end of the world.  And then we saw the
tremendous repentance of Mordecai and that all of the Jews in all of the
provinces began to sit in sackcloth and ashes.  </p>

<p>This should comfort us because God is really giving us an
insight into what spiritually happened when all of the world heard this.  This
did not happen to all of the people of the world but to the spiritual Jews of
the world.  All of the elect people were broken by this information.  They were
troubled by it and they were weeping.  Spiritually, they were brought low.  </p>

<p>Let us go back again to the timing of the proclamation.  It
was given on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month.  Haman came
before the king.  Remember that Esther 3:7 already told us that they cast the
lot.  The date was chosen earlier but we find out in verse 12 that the date
selected by lot would be Adar 13.  This is published on the 1<sup>st</sup>
month and the 13<sup>th</sup> day, and so that would have been exactly eleven
months later.  </p>

<p>So Haman gets the king&rsquo;s permission.  The letter is
written.  It is sealed by the king&rsquo;s ring and it becomes law.  It is
unalterable.  You cannot change or alter the law of the Medes and the
Persians.  In that way, too, we see how the king&rsquo;s law and his word identify
him as God as the Word of God is unchangeable.  You cannot alter the Word of
God.  </p>

<p>So the proclamation is given on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of
the 1<sup>st</sup> month of Ahasuerus&rsquo; twelfth year.  Where was this published
first?  Where was this proclamation given?  It was given in Shushan.  It says
this in Esther 3:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down
to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.  </p>

<p>This means that they definitely heard it.  This word
&ldquo;perplexed,&rdquo; by the way, is the word &ldquo;entangled&rdquo; in Exodus 14:3 when Pharaoh
says of the Jews, &ldquo;They <i>are </i>entangled in the land, the wilderness hath
shut them in.&rdquo;  This word is only found three times in the Old Testament.  It
is found here in Esther 3, in Exodus 14, and then in Joel 1:18 where it is also translated as &ldquo;perplexed.&rdquo;  Joel 1:18 relates to the time of the great
tribulation.  </p>

<p>So here in Esther 3, the city of Shushan hears this
announcement and it is perplexing to them.  We are not going to get into what
this means spiritually.  The important thing is that they hear it.  </p>

<p>When did they hear this?  If this was given the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month, when did Shushan hear it?  They heard it on
the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month.  When did someone in the province
 of India hear it?  They probably heard this a lot later than that because the
post had to go by horseback or camel or dromedary.  How ever they went for that
long of a distance, it probably would have taken some time.  But in Shushan, it
was published immediately because that was the central government.  That was
where the law was given; and so everyone in Shushan heard this on day one.  It
is important that they heard this from day one.  </p>

<p>Also, when the kings of the Medes and the Persians would
give a law, I think that we can be pretty sure that they would date it, which
is just like so many things of our day.  I do not think that we are any
different than past civilizations.  We date everything.  Our newspapers have
the date.  Not everyone does this, but if I write a letter, I date it.  I date
my notes.  Sometimes I put the wrong date, but I date my notes.  If you look at
a book, the book will have its date in the beginning of the book.  We tend to
date everything.  </p>

<p>Of course, as far as the laws of kings, it would be wise for
them to have a date.  What if they had a question about that law?  What if they
needed to find that law again?  How were they going to find it?  Remember that
they did search for the decree of the king in the book of Ezra.  In Ezra 6,
this is after Cyrus had given permission for the Jews to begin rebuilding the
temple.  Then it was stopped and then they began to build again under the prophesying
of Haggai and Zechariah.  But then the question came up as to why they were
building this, and so word came back to the later King Darius as we read in
Ezra 6:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. And there was
found at Achmetha, in the palace that <i>is </i>in the province of the Medes, a
roll, and therein <i>was </i>a record thus written: In the first year of Cyrus
the king <i>the same </i>Cyrus the king made a decree <i>concerning </i>the
house of God at Jerusalem&hellip;  </p>

<p>So they actually had a &ldquo;house of the rolls.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is like congress today and the presidents of our day. 
They pass a lot of laws.  New laws are constantly being made and old laws are
constantly being changed or altered.  In the case of the Medes and the
Persians, they could write a new law, as we will see in the book of Esther, but
they could not change one of their old laws.  </p>

<p>These laws were very important, and so they would be kept in
order.  There would be the rolls of King Cyrus according to his years, and we
see that they found &ldquo;the first year of Cyrus.&rdquo;  Of course, if they already have
them dated by year, what is the next step?  More order was needed than that
because a king could make many decrees in one year; and so they would have them
by month and, naturally, they would have them by day.  This is the way it would
be done if they were very orderly, and these people were very orderly and law-abiding
people.  I think that we can be very sure that the law that was given in
Shushan would have had a date on it.  It would have had a date.  </p>

<p>For some laws, we can absolutely see the importance of
having a date, like in Daniel 6 when King Darius who took Babylon made a decree
that he was deceived into making.  We read in Daniel 6:7-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to
establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask
a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be
cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the
writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
Persians, which altereth not. Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the
decree.  </p>

<p>So here was a law given with a date, an expiration date of
30 days.  Do you think that this was important for them to know the date that
this law was given?  Else, how would they know when the 30 days would have been
up unless they knew the first day when it began?  That would have been the only
way to know when they were safely past the 30 days and could make a decree
again.  </p>

<p>So even though it does not say that the law was dated, it
would have had to have been.  We do not read that it was given on such-and-such
a day and then expired 30 days later, but it would have necessarily had to have
had the date even though we do not read it explicitly.  </p>

<p>It actually does not matter, but I think that it is a fact
that their laws would have had dates.  It does not matter because it was
published in Shushan and the city of Shushan was perplexed.  </p>

<p>This would have included Esther.  Where was Esther?  She was
in the palace.  Would Esther have heard about that law?  I am sure that she would
have.  She would have also known that that law was given.  </p>

<p>Then we move into Esther 4.  We read in Esther 4:1-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; And came even before the king's
gate: for none <i>might </i>enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. And
in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, <i>there
was </i>great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing;
and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. So Esther's maids and her chamberlains
came and told <i>it </i>her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she
sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but
he received <i>it </i>not. Then called Esther for Hatach, <i>one </i>of the
king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
commandment to Mordecai, to know what it <i>was, </i>and why it <i>was.</i> So
Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which <i>was </i>before
the king's gate. And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries
for the Jews, to destroy them. Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the
decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show <i>it </i>unto
Esther&hellip;  </p>

<p>So Mordecai had a copy of the writing and he gave it to
Hatach the chamberlain, and Hatach took it to Esther; and so she would have had
a piece of paper or a scroll of some sort that would have had this new decree
laid out.  On it would be the time that it was given.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and to declare <i>it </i>unto her, and to charge her that she
should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request
before him for her people. And Hatach came and told Esther the words of
Mordecai. Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
Mordecai; All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do
know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the
inner court, who is not called, <i>there is </i>one law of his to put <i>him </i>to
death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he
may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty
days. And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.  </p>

<p>We will slow down maybe next week and go back over this to
see some of the significant things spiritually, but right now we are interested
in the dating and the timing of the decree given and how this relates to
Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Notice what Esther said when Mordecai sent word back for her
to go into the king.  She responds, &ldquo;I have not been called to go into the king
for thirty days.&rdquo;  Is this true or false?  This is false.  She did not say &ldquo;for
thirty days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is how I have always read this and I think that this is
how we have always read it, that the last time that she went into the king was
thirty days ago.  This is how we would say it.  </p>

<p>It is January 1<sup>st</sup>, so let us say that the last
time I went into the king or into the palace or personally met with the king
was on December 2<sup>nd</sup>, thirty days ago; and so I have not been called
to go into the king for thirty days, meaning that was the last time.  But she
is not referring to that.  What is she referring to?  She says, &ldquo;I have not
been called to come in unto the king <span class="underline">these</span> thirty days.&rdquo;  Why &ldquo;these&rdquo;? 
&ldquo;These&rdquo; is a demonstrative pronoun.  It refers to something that is close or to
something that is near or to something that is far: these or those, this or
that.  This is normally referring to an object, to something that is in view.  </p>

<p>For instance, if we go to 1 Kings 17:24, this word that is translated &ldquo;these&rdquo; is found there.  This is a pretty common word.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the woman said to Elijah, Now by <span class="underline">this</span> I know that
thou <i>art </i>a man of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;By this&rdquo; is referring to the action of her son being raised
to life.  She is referring to a particular thing, not just anything but &ldquo;by
this.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It is the same thing in 2 Kings 5:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, <i>Am </i>I God, to kill and to
make alive, that <span class="underline">this</span> man doth send unto me to recover a man of his
leprosy?&hellip; </p>

<p>This was the case of Naaman the Syrian.  The king of Syria
sent a letter to the king of Israel telling him that Naaman was coming to be
cured.  </p>

<p>So the king of Israel is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>Am </i>I God, to kill and to make alive, that <span class="underline">this</span>
man&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is not referring to just any man, but to the man who
sent the letter, the king of Syria.  </p>

<p>This is also found in Esther 9:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore they called these [<i>note: this is not the word</i>]
days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of <span class="underline">this</span>
letter&hellip;  </p>

<p>So it is this particular letter.  There could be a million
letters, but &ldquo;this&rdquo; is the letter.  </p>

<p>When Esther is saying, &ldquo;I have not been called to come in
unto the king <span class="underline">these</span> thirty days,&rdquo; she can hold up the copy of the
writing in her hand, the copy of the decree that was given her that was
probably dated.  Even if it was not dated, she would know that the decree was
given thirty days ago on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month.  </p>

<p>For that period of time, she was trying to explain to
Mordecai, to the one who adopted her, &ldquo;I have had no opportunity; I have had no
chance to make any plea to the king for these thirty days,&rdquo; because that period
of time was what was in view between her and Mordecai.  That was what she was
referring to.  </p>

<p>Mordecai does not care if she went into the king six months
ago.  No; the important thing that they are discussing is the decree that was
given, and that is what Esther is referring to when she said, &ldquo;I have not been
called to come in unto the king these thirty days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This tells us the date that she and Mordecai are having this
discussion.  What date would that have been?  Thirty days later after 1/13,
because the decree was given on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month, would have been the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month. 
This would have been when she was speaking to Mordecai.  </p>

<p>This has been checked out, by the way, by someone who is
very good at this, Mike Cook.  He is the one who came up with the 722,500 days,
which is the timeline from the cross to May 21, 2011.  I think that he is very,
very good at finding out these kinds of things.  I have a spreadsheet from him
for anyone who would like to see it that lays out the whole 12<sup>th</sup>
year of King Ahasuerus.  You can see it day-by-day, and from the 13<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month to the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month is 30 days.  </p>

<p>Why is this important?  This is important because what does
Esther then say to Mordecai?  Look at Esther 4:13-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. For if thou
altogether holdest thy peace at this time, <i>then </i>shall there enlargement
and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's
house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom
for <i>such </i>a time as this? Then Esther bade <i>them </i>return Mordecai <i>this
answer,</i> Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and
fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and
my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which <i>is </i>not
according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. So Mordecai went his way, and
did according to all that Esther had commanded him.  </p>

<p>So now we are reading an historical account in Esther where
Esther said to Mordecai, &ldquo;Gather the Jews and fast for three nights and three
days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us say that they began that night, which was the night
of the 13<sup>th</sup>, then the night of the 14<sup>th</sup> and the night of
the 15<sup>th</sup>.  The first day would have been the 14<sup>th</sup>, the
second day would have been the 15<sup>th</sup>, and the third day would have
been the 16<sup>th</sup>; and so it would have been 2/16.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Esther 5:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass on the third day&hellip;  </p>

<p>On the third day, she went into the king.  This would have
been 2/16 and this is pretty close.  But someone might be wondering, &ldquo;Close to
what?  What are you talking about?&rdquo;  Well, remember the flood?  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Genesis 7.  By the way, &ldquo;close,&rdquo; as they
used to say, only matters in horseshoes and hand grenades.  God does not deal
with &ldquo;close.&rdquo;  When somebody says, and I have heard this with timelines, &ldquo;Well,
we go here and we jump there and then we are just two weeks away from something
important.&rdquo;  No; no.  God does not do things that way.  With God, it is precise
and it is exact; it is not horseshoes.  Leaners do not count.  You have to get
it right on the mark and then you can know that this is what God is doing.  </p>

<p>In Genesis 7, after seven days when God first forewarned
Noah and said, &ldquo;For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the
earth,&rdquo; we realized that this statement was given in 4990 B.C.  Then we
realized that 2 Peter insists that we give one thousand years for a day.  When
we go seven thousand years later, it lands in 2011, which was last year because
this is now 2012.  But remember the day that the flood began.  </p>

<p>It says in Genesis 7:11:   </p>

<p class="verse">In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  </p>

<p>This began the flood period on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of Noah&rsquo;s calendar.  </p>

<p>We were all amazed &ndash; I know that I was &ndash; when 7,000 years
later, we were looking.  We knew that 2011 would be 7,000 years, but where
would it fall?  Well, it so happened that May 21, 2011 was the last day of a 23-year great tribulation period, exactly.  From May 21, 1988 to May 21, 2011 was a full 23 years.  It was also precisely 8400 days and the number 84
has everything to do with the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>So there is the spot.  God put His finger on it.  He locked
it in; and so we thought that May 21 would be Judgment Day.  Actually, what it
turned out to be was the day that God shut the door.  </p>

<p>Some people say that Genesis 7 does not refer to a door
because it says in Genesis 7 that &ldquo;the LORD shut him in.&rdquo;  You tell me, what
else could have been shut?  What else shut them in?  Did they have the door
open when the flood came?  No; of course it was the door.  </p>

<p>God uses this language of &ldquo;shut&rdquo; in connection with a door
many times.  He shut the door and the door in the Bible represents Christ; and
He is the door to Heaven.  He is the only door.  We will not get into this
right now, but this was the significance.  The great significance of May 21 was
that it was the end of the great tribulation after 7,000 years.  </p>

<p>How else could that have worked out?  That had to be God
putting His finger on that date of the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, because May 21 of 2011 in the Hebrew calendar is the 17<sup>th</sup> day
of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  God, by causing all of that to happen, was
saying, &ldquo;Yes; this is the date and this is where you look.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So in Esther, we find that a decree is given.  Spiritually,
the context is during the great tribulation and this decree is published to all
of the world.  It is sent out on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month.  Then Esther refers to a time period of 30 days.  </p>

<p>Come on.  How easy would it be to be wrong about this and to
be off?  If she had said 40 days, it would not fit.  If she had said 20 days,
29 days, or any other number, it would not fit.  The number 30 is the one
number that makes this fit.  If the decree had been given on the 10<sup>th</sup>
day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month or the 28<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month or any other day but the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup> month,
it would not fit.  If there had been no period of three nights and days of
fasting, it would not fit.  </p>

<p>But someone could say, &ldquo;This does not fit because it is on
the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month when Esther goes into the
king.&rdquo;  Yes, but let us read from Esther 5.  It says in Esther 5:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass on the third day&hellip;  </p>

<p>That would have been the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that Esther put on <i>her </i>royal <i>apparel, </i>and stood
in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the
king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the
house.  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
court, <i>that </i>she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to
Esther the golden sceptre that <i>was </i>in his hand. So Esther drew near, and
touched the top of the sceptre. Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou,
queen Esther? and what <i>is </i>thy request? it shall be even given thee to
the half of the kingdom. And Esther answered, If <i>it seem </i>good unto the
king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
prepared for him.  </p>

<p>God does not want us to miss the timing, which was 2/16.  On
the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, they were to come to this
banquet.  </p>

<p>Was not that first banquet that Esther had a very strange
banquet?  I have always thought that it was just so strange, because they do
come and then look what happens.  We read in Esther 5:5-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had
prepared. And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What <i>is </i>thy
petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what <i>is </i>thy request? even to
the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. Then answered Esther, and said,
My petition and my request <i>is;</i> If I have found favour in the sight of
the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for
them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.  </p>

<p>What date would this have been?  This would have been on the
17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>We see everything that had to fall into place in order for
this to have worked out.  Any other date but the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 1<sup>st</sup>
month would not fit.  If Esther had said any other length of time than those 30
days, it would not fit.  If they had fasted for any length of time different
than the three days and three nights, it would not fit.  If they had fasted not
at all, it would not fit.  If they had come to the first banquet and everything
had been laid out there, it would not fit.  But for some reason, she tells them
to come back the next day; and God makes a point that she came on the third
day.  The first banquet was on that day, and then the next day or &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;
would have been the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>If what had occurred at that second banquet of wine would
have been something that had no spiritual significance, then I would say that
maybe all of these things were coincidences.  But what happened on that 17<sup>th</sup>
day?  How did it begin?  </p>

<p>The king could not sleep; and so Haman had a bad day.  He
had a very bad day.  He was in the outer court and he was brought in and he was
humiliated.  He was humbled and brought low right away.  He had to take
Mordecai, who was his enemy, around on horseback through the city.  What was
that doing to Mordecai?  It was lifting Mordecai up and exalting him.  Things
went downhill from there for Haman, and then he is hung on a gallows later that
day on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>That would have been a good place for the book of Esther to
end, but it does not end there.  Time goes on, because there is still a set
day.  There is still the 13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month, and
Haman still has ten sons.  They are not killed until the 13<sup>th</sup> day of
the 12<sup>th</sup> month.  </p>

<p>We will look at this, spiritually, next week.  But can you
see this?  I hope that you can, because I can see it.  I see that God has put
His finger on the date of May 21 through this 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  On that date, He is telling us that we were correct and that there was
a spiritual judgment day.  Satan was put down.  Christ was exalted and lifted
up, as Mordecai was brought around on horseback, and that it is not yet the end
because we have to go a little further.  </p>

<p>I wanted to lay this out because I would appreciate any
feedback towards this.  Also, I think that we are going to have to start
sharing this information, because there is a second letter that goes out to the
people and I think that everyone is going to need to know the significance of
this in order to see that we really should be sharing this information.  </p>

<p>I do not think that we will be doing anything like we did
prior to May 21.  We cannot because we do not have the resources.  We do not
have the ability to warn people about this date.  The world was warned about
May 21 and October 21, but no one heard about Purim; and so I think that we
will try to do what we can.  </p>

<p>Keep this in mind.  It is so quiet out there that when you
make a little sound, it can sound pretty loud.  It is so dark that when you
light a little match, it can seem like a big fire.  Also, God does not need
us.  He can do this.  But just imagine what one or two well-placed billboards
could do at this time.  I do not know what God is going to do, but I think that
we can just do what we can and then let Him take it from there.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
