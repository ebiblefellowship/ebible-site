<p>We will be looking at Revelation 19 today.  We had gone to
Revelation 19 last time and we saw that there was a marriage in view between
the Bride of Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ who is the Bridegroom.  </p>

<p>This &ldquo;marriage supper&rdquo; is not like we would understand a marriage
feast to be.  We would understand a marriage feast to be an event where we
would wear our best formal attire and participate in a sit-down dinner.  No;
this supper is actually a battle.  This is the battle of Armageddon.  This is
Judgment Day, and so the fowls are called to this feast to feed on all of the
dead bodies of the enemies of God.  This spiritually began on May 21 with all
of those in the churches and congregations, and this will conclude on October
21 with the rest of the unsaved who are in the world.  </p>

<p>We were able to lock in the timing of this &ldquo;marriage supper&rdquo;
because of what we read in Ezekiel 32.  I will just read a couple of verses in
Ezekiel 32.  Ezekiel 32 is talking about the dragon, who is Satan, and he gave
the beast his authority.  It says in Ezekiel 32:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thus saith the Lord JEHOVAH; I will therefore spread out my net
over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my
net. Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open
field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I
will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.  </p>

<p>The dragon is taken out of his waters and thrown into the
open field.  Ezekiel 29 adds the information, &ldquo;I will cause the fish of thy
rivers to stick unto thy scales.&rdquo;  In Revelation 19, this would be referring to
&ldquo;the beast&rdquo; and &ldquo;the false prophet,&rdquo; as the false prophet identifies with the
churches.  But here is where we can pinpoint the time that this is happening. 
We read in Ezekiel 32:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make
the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall
not give her light. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,
and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>When the sun is darkened is when the dragon is taken out of
his waters, he is cast upon the open field along with the fish of his rivers,
and then they are given to the fowls.  </p>

<p>So when was the sun darkened?  Matthew 24:29 tells us, &ldquo;Immediately
after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened.&rdquo;  This is one
tie-in.  A second tie-in that locks this in is Revelation 9:2.  When &ldquo;the
bottomless pit&rdquo; is opened and smoke comes out of the pit, this darkens the
sun.  </p>

<p>This is the first thing that happens, and smoke has to do
with God&rsquo;s judgment.  We also know that what is going on in Revelation 9 is for
five months, which began on May 21.  The sun was darkened spiritually on May 21
and will remain dark over the whole earth.  Spiritually, no one will see the
light of the Gospel for these five months.  </p>

<p>Leading into Revelation 19, let us go to the close of
Revelation 18.  This is describing the fall of Babylon, which historically
happened after that 70-year period that typifies the great tribulation.  And so
this is what happens after the great tribulation.  Here is what God says in
Revelation 18:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is another synonym for the same thing.  There is no
sunlight, there is no moonlight, and there is no starlight.  There is not even
the light of a candle.  There is darkness, complete darkness, spiritually speaking,
in all of the earth, because Babylon here is typifying the whole world.  </p>

<p>Then it continues to say:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard
no more at all in thee&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;The voice of the bridegroom&rdquo; is referring to Christ. 
Remember that John the Baptist said in John 3 that he heard the Bridegroom&rsquo;s
voice, and then he said, &ldquo;He must increase, but I <i>must </i>decrease.&rdquo;  The
voice of Christ is the Word of God, the Bible.  </p>

<p>Think about what this is saying.  This is saying that the
Bible will be &ldquo;heard no more at all&rdquo; in Babylon for these five months.  </p>

<p>Is this true?  Family Radio is still broadcasting.  They are
still sending the Bible into all the world.  It is still going into all the
earth, which is Babylon.  Is not Babylon hearing the &ldquo;voice of the bridegroom,&rdquo;
the voice of Christ?  </p>

<p>No.  The key phrase here is &ldquo;the voice of the bridegroom <span class="underline">and</span>
of the bride,&rdquo; because it is the believers who carry this Word.  This says
again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the voice of the bridegroom <span class="underline">and</span> of the bride <span class="underline">shall be
heard no more</span> at all in thee&hellip;</p>

<p>So this does not mean that we have been removed.  This does
not necessarily have to mean this at all, even though we thought that we would
be taken out.  But this does not mean that.  </p>

<p>What was the condition of the church over the last 23
years?  They had the Bible and they had preachers preaching the Bible, but they
had one problem.  There was a famine of hearing, and we know that the Bible
tells us, &ldquo;Faith <i>cometh </i>by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What God is saying is that when He does this &ndash; and He has
already done this beginning on Judgment Day &ndash; that never again would someone be
given spiritual ears to hear the Word of God anew.  People all over the world
can hear the Bible with their physical ears, but never again will anyone be
given the gift of spiritual life and spiritual ears to hear what Christ has
said in parables, to understand these things and to perceive them.  This will
not happen anymore, because this says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no
more at all&hellip;  </p>

<p>Remember what we read in Psalm 19 and how God speaks of the
celestial lights or the celestial bodies.  He tells us in Psalm 19:1-2:   </p>

<p class="verse">The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth
his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth
knowledge.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that there is a God, even though they deny
this.  They suppress this and hold this down.  They say that there is no God,
and then they try to live out their lives in this lie, which people can and do;
and yet everyone knows that there is a God.  Everyone knows deep down that,
obviously, God created these things.  </p>

<p>Look now at verse 4.  We read in Psalm 19:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which <i>is
</i>as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber&hellip;    </p>

<p>So Christ is the Bridegroom and He is also the Sun, that great
light.  He is the light of the world.  And God here equates the Bridegroom with
the Sun.  And He is telling us in every way possible that the sun is dark and
that the voice is gone, that there is no longer any salvation.  </p>

<p>It is not a small thing and it is not a minor matter to say
that God is still saving when He is not.  Some people say that we should be
careful in saying that salvation has ended, and they are right.  This is true. 
But we have to be very careful, actually, we have to be equally as careful if
someone dares to say that there is salvation when there is not salvation.  </p>

<p>This is what is going on with the gospels in the churches. 
They claim that they have salvation.  They tell people to come to them and that
they will provide salvation, but there is no salvation there.  </p>

<p>Is this a small thing?  Is this not why God basically
brought judgment upon them?  Was it not because they made this kind of a claim? 
</p>

<p>God is telling us all over the Bible that the door has shut,
the door to the sheepfold.  He is telling us that the sun is dark and that the
voice is no longer heard.  He is telling us this in many, many ways.  The
amount of evidence that God has given us that May 21 was Judgment Day is
overwhelming.  </p>

<p>If someone says that this is true but that God is still
saving, how could this be possible?  How is this possible?  </p>

<p>God made something very, very sure when He stressed something
while Abraham was interceding for Sodom.  Abraham had asked God, &ldquo;Wilt thou
also destroy the righteous with the wicked?&rdquo;  Then Abraham interceded as he
counted down the possibility of the righteous in Sodom, from fifty down to
twenty.  Far be it from the Lord to destroy the righteous with the wicked.  </p>

<p>Lot lived in Sodom, and the Bible tells us that he had a
righteous soul.  2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 2 tells us, &ldquo;For that righteous man
dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed <i>his </i>righteous soul
from day to day with <i>their </i>unlawful deeds.&rdquo; </p>

<p>So God waited until Lot stepped his foot into Zoar before
bringing the fire and brimstone. This is because Lot represents all of the
righteous, and all of the righteous have to be in a safe place, which is
spiritually only in Christ, before fire and brimstone can fall.  </p>

<p>Fire and brimstone cannot be falling spiritually, which
means that Judgment Day cannot be here, if there is a righteous soul out there
who has not been brought to safety and who has not been delivered.  If there is
an elect person anywhere in the world who still needs to be saved, meaning that
salvation has not yet been applied to them and that they have not been
redeemed, this means that God could not have brought Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>There are people who understand many of these things.  They
understand that May 21 was a special day.  They understand that it ended the
great tribulation.  Even those who say that God is still continuing to save throughout
these five months admit these things.  They admit this, but they have a big
problem when we look at Revelation 7.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Revelation 7 where we read about the
&ldquo;multitude, which no man could number.&rdquo;  This is what we read in Revelation 7:9,
and then it says in Revelation 7:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?  </p>

<p>Notice that this is speaking of &ldquo;white robes.&rdquo;  This is just
like what the Bride wears and just like what the horsemen in Revelation 19
wear.  This indicates that one&rsquo;s sins have been taken away and that they are
now pure in God&rsquo;s sight.  They have been made spotless and holy.  </p>

<p>So the following question is asked of one of the elders:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence
came they?  </p>

<p>Then we read in Revelation 7:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I said unto him, Sir&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; is the word for &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo;  It is the Greek
word <i>kurios</i> (pronounced koo'-ree-os).  </p>

<p>So Revelation 7:14 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I said unto him, Sir [<i>or Lord</i>], thou knowest. And he
said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.  </p>

<p>This does not say that they came out of five months of
torment.  This does not say that they came out of October 21.  The great
tribulation, which was an exact 23 years, ended on May 21, and they came out of
that great tribulation.  </p>

<p>I do not know what other group people must be thinking
about.  There are the firstfruits who came during the church age.  Then there
are those brought in during the latter rain, and the latter rain ended on May 21, 2011.  These are finally brought in on October 21.  This is when God will bring
everyone to Heaven.  </p>

<p>By the way, fruit was gathered before the feast.  Fruit was
not gathered during a feast.  All of the men had to go to Jerusalem and they
may have lived hundreds of miles away.  Do you think that God would have
burdened them by having them first go to the feast and then run back home at
the end of each day in order to continue harvesting their crops?  </p>

<p>No.  They harvested their crops before they held the feast. 
In this way, they did not appear before the Lord empty.  This is as He said,
&ldquo;They shall not appear before the LORD empty.&rdquo;  It was then that they had
something to rejoice in.  It was then that they had an offering that they could
make as they brought in their fruit for the year.  </p>

<p>Anyone who thinks that God is going to go all the way in
harvesting souls until the very last day of October 21 has no historical feast
to base this on.  None at all.  God said three times that it was after the
fruit was gathered in that the feast was to be held.  Actually, once He said &ldquo;after&rdquo;
and twice He said &ldquo;when,&rdquo; which is past tense.  This was when they were to hold
the feast.  </p>

<p>So the great multitude came out of great tribulation, not
out of five months.  Even though the great multitude is here during these five
months, at least the vast majority of them who will not have died during this
time, God is still not continuing to save.  </p>

<p>God views this as saving all of them during the 6100 days of
the latter rain.  This is what we are identified with, which is like the three
thousand who were saved on Pentecost in 33 A.D.  The great multitude cannot be
identified with anything else but the great tribulation.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Revelation 19.  We see the Bride in verse 8
and that she has &ldquo;made herself ready.&rdquo;  Then we read in Revelation 19:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.  </p>

<p>Whenever we see the language of &ldquo;fine linen, clean and white&rdquo;
or &ldquo;white robes,&rdquo; this is pointing to the elect people of God, to those who are
the true believers.  When we read about angels, like we do in Revelation 15,
who are &ldquo;clothed in pure and white linen,&rdquo; these are not angels.  They are not
spirit beings because this points to &ldquo;the righteousness of saints.&rdquo;  This is
pointing to Christ&rsquo;s righteousness that He has provided for His people.  </p>

<p>Several times in the book of Revelation, we read of those
clothed in white.  We just read in Revelation 7 that the great multitude is in
white robes.  Here in Revelation 19, the Bride is arrayed in white.  </p>

<p>Now go down to verse 14.  We read in Revelation 19:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the armies <i>which were </i>in heaven followed him upon
white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.  </p>

<p>These armies are God&rsquo;s people.  They are all of the elect.  Just
like the Bride are all of God&rsquo;s elect who have been saved throughout history,
these horsemen are all of the elect.  This is why we had to modify what we were
understanding about Revelation 9 and the 200 million horsemen.  This number
does include all of the elect saved throughout time.  </p>

<p>What God is doing is that He is bringing judgment through
the salvation of His people, through the completion of saving all of the
elect.  I would not want to say that this is the complete judgment, but this is
most of it.  The essence of this judgment is that God has saved all of His
people.  </p>

<p>Let me just describe what I mean.  God saved 200 million
throughout all of history and He mentions them in Revelation 9.  These were all
of those whose names were written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life.  </p>

<p>Upon saving the last one of them, there are now no other
names in this Book who need to become saved.  This was done by the last day of
the great tribulation, which was May 21.  Then we transitioned into Judgment
Day for five months.  </p>

<p>But it is this fact or this information that brings the
torment to all of the unsaved in the world who are not in the churches.  This
is because this is sorrowful information.  This is awful news.  This is because
the whole world has always lived in sin, yet they lived with the possibility of
salvation throughout history, except for that period of 2300 evening/mornings
where virtually no one was being saved during the first part of the great
tribulation.  </p>

<p>Then on May 21, something happened that has never happened
before to where now no one can ever become saved again.  This is the torment
for the unsaved of the world and this is the deathblow or the killing of those
in the churches.  </p>

<p>God is using His people to fight the battle of Armageddon,
just like we see Christ here in Revelation 19 on a white horse.  We read in
Revelation 19:11-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
sat upon him <i>was </i>called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth
judge and make war. His eyes <i>were </i>as a flame of fire, and on his head <i>were
</i>many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And
he <i>was </i>clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called
The Word of God. And the armies <i>which were </i>in heaven followed him upon
white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to describe this battle with the beast and
his army.  </p>

<p>But now we have a problem, because are we not supposed to be
marching peacefully and rejoicing with no need to fight in this battle?  Is
this not what we find in 2 Chronicles 20 with Jehoshaphat and his army, which
is also a picture of Judgment Day?  </p>

<p>Well, on one hand, we are an army that is going to the
battle that God is going to win.  On the other hand, we have no need to fight. 
This is because God is basically using us, the elect, as an instrument, which
is like what we thought before.  </p>

<p>If you remember, Mr. Camping taught that on May 21 the
rapture of the living and the resurrection of the dead would be the deathblow
to all of those left behind.  This is what would have brought the torment and
the sorrow that they were not one of them.  </p>

<p>Of course, things did not happen this way.  The five months
came and what God did did not require an actual rapture and resurrection to bring
that blow.  It just required God to save everyone whom He intended to save.  It
is this that is the lethal blow that comes against all of the unsaved, whether
they are in the world or in the church.  It is that final completion that is
the battle of Armageddon, and God uses His people in this sense.  </p>

<p>Let us look at the color white.  We find that Christ is on a
white horse, the believers are clothed in white.  So if we go to Revelation 6,
we again find a reference to Jesus in verse 2.  It says in Revelation 6:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had
a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to
conquer.  </p>

<p>This is referring to the beginning of the church age. 
Notice that this says that He is going forth.  The victory will be won, but God
has to first bring His Word throughout many centuries, which is what He did
through the many years of the church age.  And so He goes forth conquering and
then finally will conquer.  At this time, He has now conquered because the
victory has been won.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;conquer&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; or
&ldquo;victory.&rdquo;  In Revelation 15:2 where we read of those who got victory over the
beast, the word &ldquo;victory&rdquo; there is the same word as &ldquo;conquer.&rdquo;  And so at this
time, Christ has now conquered.  His people won the victory on Judgment Day and
throughout this period of time of these five months.  </p>

<p>So that was one reference.  Let us also go to Revelation 1
where we find Jesus in view again.  We read in Revelation 1:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <i>one </i>like unto
the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the
paps with a golden girdle. His head and <i>his </i>hairs <i>were </i>white like
wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <i>were </i>as a flame of fire;  </p>

<p>This language fits perfectly with what we read in Daniel 7. 
We read in Daniel 7:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
days did sit, whose garment <i>was </i>white as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne <i>was like </i>the fiery flame, <i>and </i>his
wheels <i>as </i>burning fire.  </p>

<p>This matches well with what we read in Revelation 1
describing Jesus, which means that Jesus is &ldquo;the Ancient of days.&rdquo;  This is no
surprise to us.  The Bible tells us everywhere that Christ is eternal God.  He
is the Almighty.  </p>

<p>But then look at verse 10.  We read in Daniel 7:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Revelation 20 has this same kind of language.  We find
eternal God on what kind of a throne in Revelation 20?  In Revelation 20:11-12,
we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for
them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
opened: and another book was opened, which is <i>the book </i>of life: and the
dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according
to their works.  </p>

<p>This is referring to a &ldquo;great white throne,&rdquo; so you had
better have on white robes if you have anything to do with Judgment Day at this
&ldquo;great white throne,&rdquo; because this is going to require absolute purity,
absolute perfection, without spot.  You can have no spots at all, not one sin
will be permitted.  This requires the robe of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.  </p>

<p>But notice that this judgment is the opening of the books. 
The Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life is opened and has within it the names of 200 million,
the 200 million whom God saved throughout all of history, from Abel all the way
to whoever that last one was before He brought Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>This has everything to do with judgment, everything; because
if your name is not found in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life, this means that you are
under the wrath of God.  This is the judgment of God.  You will not have
eternal life.  You are not going to live forever.  </p>

<p>This is an awful thing.  Whether people know this or not is
not important.  It is an awful thing to just have a few days of time and not
eternity, when God has given such a glorious blessing in His salvation to those
elect ones whom He chose.  </p>

<p>So here in Daniel 7, we find that Christ is &ldquo;the Ancient of
days.&rdquo;  The judgment is set.  The books are opened.  Then we read in Daniel
7:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake: I beheld <i>even </i>till the beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and given to the burning flame.  </p>

<p>When does this take place?  </p>

<p>Turn back to Revelation 19.  This is describing events that
do conclude in October, the last day of the five months.  But these events
describe what began on May 21, which is the victory over the beast who was just
referred to.  It says in Revelation 19:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and
against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the
mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast
alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.  </p>

<p>This is telling us that they are not dead.  They are not
dead.  They are alive.  This is because this happened on May 21.  Satan still
exists.  He has conscious existence.  I would not say that he has life, but he
does have conscious existence.  He thinks.  He has a mind.  So, too, do those
in the churches and congregations who are identified with the false prophet. 
They are very much alive physically, but God judged them when we made this
transition.  </p>

<p>This went from being in the church where no one was being
saved, to an expansion of this where in all of the world no one can be saved. 
Therefore, this slew them.  From May 20<sup>th</sup> to May 21<sup>st</sup>,
which was Judgment Day, they were taken and cast into a &ldquo;lake of fire,&rdquo; and
this is all spiritual.  </p>

<p>Do not think about these things literally.  There will be a
literal last day when there will be the final destruction of this creation and
then the creation of a new heavens and a new earth.  But as far as the
beginning of Judgment Day, this is all spiritual.  The beast and the church
have been slain, and yet they still live.  </p>

<p>If we go back to Daniel 7, it says in Daniel 7:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the
burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</p>

<p>This is obviously referring to Judgment Day.  Obviously, the
beast was slain in the burning fire; and God connects what verse 12 says with
verse 11 by saying &ldquo;as concerning the rest of the beasts.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Earlier in Daniel 7, God speaks of four beasts.  These
identify very much with Revelation 13.  Look at Daniel 7:3.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
another.  </p>

<p>Now look at Revelation 13:1.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea&hellip;  </p>

<p>Clearly, God makes this link.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Daniel 7:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet
of it: and it <i>was </i>diverse from all the beasts that <i>were </i>before
it; and it had ten horns. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up
among them another little horn&hellip;   </p>

<p>Now go back to Revelation 13:1, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten
crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.  </p>

<p>Daniel 7 and Revelation 13 go hand in hand.  The beast is
Satan who is loosed.  Revelation 11 says that he ascends out of the bottomless
pit.  He kills the two witnesses, which began the great tribulation period and
judgment on the church.  Now Daniel 7:11 is describing the beast as being taken
and killed, but that there are other beasts.  </p>

<p>Basically, what this is saying is that Satan officially had
his rule come to an end in the church and in the world, but that he still
exists.  In Daniel 7:12, it says that they &ldquo;had their dominion taken away.&rdquo;  He
has no official authority, none.  His dominion has been taken away, and yet
their lives &ldquo;were prolonged for a season and time.&rdquo;  This is because there is
still time after he goes into the &ldquo;lake of fire,&rdquo; which we read about in
Revelation 19.  </p>

<p>This is another confirmation.  The sun darkens on May 21. 
Ezekiel 32 said that this is when the dragon is given to the fowls.  Now God is
indicating that the beast goes into the fire, and yet &ldquo;the rest of the beasts&rdquo;
have an extension of some sort, a prolonging of time, which will go for five
months.  We know that this is what is going on.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Revelation 19.  In verse 14, it speaks of
&ldquo;the armies <i>which were </i>in heaven.&rdquo;  Then Revelation 19:15 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword&hellip;</p>

<p>This is speaking of Christ and this sword is the Word of
God.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule
them with a rod of iron&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is a reference to Psalm 2.  We read in Psalm 2:7-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will declare the decree: JEHOVAH hath said unto me, Thou <i>art
</i>my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give <i>thee </i>the
heathen <i>for </i>thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth <i>for
</i>thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt <span class="underline">dash
them in pieces</span> like a potter's vessel.  </p>

<p>Here is a reference to a &ldquo;rod of iron.&rdquo;  It is Christ who
has this &ldquo;rod of iron.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;dash them in pieces&rdquo; is a Hebrew word that is
also found in Jeremiah 51.  This is going to relate to Jacob who typifies the
elect people of God.  Remember that it said in Psalm 2 that the &ldquo;rod of iron&rdquo;
would basically dash the wicked in pieces.  In Jeremiah 51:19-23, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">The portion of Jacob <i>is </i>not like them; for he <i>is </i>the
former of all things: and <i>Israel</i><i> is </i>the rod of his inheritance:
JEHOVAH of hosts <i>is </i>his name. Thou <i>art </i>my battle ax&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Jacob.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou <i>art </i>my battle ax <i>and </i>weapons of war: for with
thee will I <span class="underline">break in pieces</span> the nations&hellip;    </p>

<p>This is the same word for &ldquo;dash them in pieces.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee
will I destroy kingdoms; And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his
rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; With
thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in
pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and
the maid; I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and
with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with
thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.  </p>

<p>Nine times do we read this word for &ldquo;break in pieces,&rdquo; all
referring to &ldquo;with&rdquo; Jacob.  This is Babylon.  Jeremiah 50 and 51 are speaking
about Babylon and the judgment upon Babylon for what they did to God&rsquo;s people
in holding them captive and refusing to let them go.  </p>

<p>Now the captivity is turned.  God takes Jacob, the elect,
and is saying that with the elect He will break them in pieces.  He says this
again and again.  He says that He will break them in pieces nine times and once
He says that He will destroy them.  This equals ten times that He is referring
to their destruction, and ten has to do with the completeness of breaking them
in pieces.  This is referring to today, Judgment Day, when all of the unsaved
in all of the earth are being broken in pieces or dashed in pieces.  </p>

<p>Do you remember Psalm 137?  We will look at this and then
close.  This is a Psalm about Babylon.  We read in Psalm 137:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when
we remembered Zion.  </p>

<p>It then goes on; but towards the end of this Psalm, there is
language here that people have tried to use against God for a long time. 
Because of what this verse says, they have tried to paint the picture that He
is not a good God or a loving God or a kind God or a merciful God.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 137:8-9.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <i>shall
he be, </i>that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. Happy <i>shall he be, </i>that
taketh and <span class="underline">dasheth</span> thy little ones against the stones.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;dasheth&rdquo; is the same word for &ldquo;break in
pieces.&rdquo;  This is speaking of Babylon and says that &ldquo;happy <i>shall he be</i>&rdquo;
who takes their little ones, their little children, and breaks them &ldquo;against
the stones.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>How awful and how terrible this language is, and so they say
that our God is obviously ruthless, that He is just terrible if He would take
little children, even if it was an enemy, and dash them against the stones.  But
we know that this is not the character or the nature of God.  </p>

<p>Remember what God tells us in Ezekiel 33:11, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Say unto them, <i>As </i>I live, saith the Lord JEHOVAH, I have
no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way
and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways&hellip;  </p>

<p>We went to these verses many, many times leading up to May
21.  We were pleading with people and beseeching them on Christ&rsquo;s behalf to
turn because the door was shutting.  And God did turn those whom He intended to
save.  But it is a very, very great truth that He takes no pleasure or no
delight in killing the unsaved who are rebels and who have done everything
deserving of death.  </p>

<p>It is not like we do not deserve to be destroyed in horrible
ways.  We do because of our sin, but God does not delight in this.  What does
He delight in?  He delights in saving an elect people according to His good
pleasure.  This is what He delights in.  He delights in saving, but He does not
delight in destroying.  </p>

<p>So what does Psalm 137:8 mean?  It says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <i>shall
he be, </i>that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.  </p>

<p>The first question is who is the one who is said to be happy
here?  This says, &ldquo;Happy <i>shall he be</i>.&rdquo;  Who is this referring to?  Is
this referring to God?  No; this is not referring to God.  This is referring to
the people of God.  </p>

<p>Look at Revelation 18:6.  This is referring to Babylon and
it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  </p>

<p>Here God says to reward her &ldquo;even as she rewarded you.&rdquo;  And
Psalm 137:8 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;happy <i>shall he be, </i>that rewardeth thee [<i>Babylon</i>]
as thou hast served us.  </p>

<p>This is saying that as Babylon has done to us, we do to Babylon. 
We are the ones who are said to be happy here; not God.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Psalm 137:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Happy <i>shall he be, </i>that taketh and dasheth [<i>or
breaketh in pieces</i>] thy little ones against the stones.  </p>

<p>We are the ones who are happy to be taking the little ones
of Babylon and breaking them in pieces.  </p>

<p>God is saying that this is being done with Jacob, &ldquo;with
thee,&rdquo; and so we will break in pieces this and we will break in pieces that. 
It is &ldquo;with thee.&rdquo;  &ldquo;With thee&rdquo;; God will use us to break in pieces.  </p>

<p>We are not happy about this either.  It is not that we take
any pleasure in the death of the wicked either.  No; God is not saying this. 
But what is another word for &ldquo;happy&rdquo;?  Another word for &ldquo;happy&rdquo; is the word
&ldquo;blessed,&rdquo; and this is the same in the Old Testament as in the New Testament.  </p>

<p>In Deuteronomy 33:29, this word &ldquo;happy&rdquo; is defined.  This is
the same word as the word for &ldquo;blessed.&rdquo;  We read in Deuteronomy 33:29:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Happy</span> <i>art </i>thou, O Israel: who <i>is </i>like unto
thee, O people saved by JEHOVAH&hellip;  </p>

<p>Happy are you because you are saved.  </p>

<p>Then in Psalm 144:15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Happy</span> <i>is that </i>people, that is in such a case: <i>yea,
</i><span class="underline">happy</span> <i>is that </i>people, whose God <i>is </i>JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 32, we have this same Hebrew word for &ldquo;happy&rdquo; that
is translated as &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; twice in the first two verses.  We read in Psalm
32:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Blessed</span> <i>is he whose </i>transgression <i>is </i>forgiven,
<i>whose </i>sin <i>is </i>covered. <span class="underline">Blessed</span> <i>is </i>the man unto whom
JEHOVAH imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit <i>there is </i>no guile.  </p>

<p>Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven.  This means to
be blessed, and now we understand.  We now understand that Psalm 137 has
nothing to do with any kind of perverse joy or satisfaction in the death of the
wicked.  It has to do with God saving His people.  </p>

<p>Psalm 137:8 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; <span class="underline">happy</span> [<i>or
blessed</i>] <i>shall he be</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to God&rsquo;s elect.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. </p>

<p>This is as God said in Revelation 18:6.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 137:9 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="underline">Happy</span> [<i>blessed</i>] <i>shall he be</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is because God&rsquo;s people have all become saved.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;that taketh and dasheth [<i>breaketh to pieces</i>] thy little
ones against the stones.  </p>

<p>This information and this fact that God has saved everyone
in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of Life is what breaks in pieces all of those who are in the
churches, which include little ones.  They are already slain.  And this will
break in pieces all of the rest of the people of the world who are not saved on
the very last day, which is October 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>This is the judgment of God.  This is the information that
He keeps going back to again and again and again.  This is Judgment Day.  It is
not a pleasant thing that we have entered into the Day of Judgment and will
continue in this for these five months.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
