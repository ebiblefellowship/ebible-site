<p>We are going to continue a Bible study in 1<sup>st</sup>
Peter 1 today.  We are in chapter one.  I will read the first five verses before
we start.  It says in 1Peter 1:1-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, Elect according to
the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
peace, be multiplied. Blessed <i>be </i>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, To an
inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
heaven for you, Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
ready to be revealed in the last time.  </p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>Last week, we were looking at the end of verse three and
into verse four.  I understand that there were some technical difficulties.  I
am not sure what everyone heard, but we saw that God has provided for His
people an inheritance that is incorruptible due to the resurrection of Christ
from the dead.  </p>

<p>We can understand this when we realize that everything in
this world is corruptible.  Apart from the Word of God, everything has an end. 
Everything will rot and fade away, as it goes on to say, and yet the gift of
faith or the gift of salvation that God gives His elect people, people who were
chosen before the foundation of the world to receive this inheritance, goes
into eternity future.  This wonderful gift of God is incorruptible.  It cannot
pass away.  It cannot be lost in any way.  Plus, this is in Heaven, as it says
in 1Peter 1:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
not away, <span class="underline">reserved</span> in heaven for you,  </p>

<p>This is how safe and secure this wonderful promise of God
is.  It is not on earth; because if this was on earth, like any treasure, a
thief could break through and steal.  But since this is in Heaven, no thief can
break through and steal.  This gift is totally and eternally secure.  This is
just the tremendous information that we get from the Bible.  The good news of
the Bible or of the Gospel for the children of God is that salvation is
reserved.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; is found in 2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 2
a couple of times.  It says in 2Peter 2:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <i>them </i>down
to hell, and delivered <i>them </i>into chains of darkness, to be <span class="underline">reserved</span>
unto judgment;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Satan and the fallen angels, the
demons.  They have been judged and they have been under the wrath of God.  </p>

<p>This is just a matter of the utter completion or of the
fulfillment of all things.  The final destruction of these beings is reserved. 
It is kept.  This word &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; is also translated sometimes as &ldquo;keep/kept&rdquo;;
and so it is &ldquo;reserved unto judgment&rdquo; and it is guaranteed that this will take
place one day.  </p>

<p>This same word is also found in 2Peter 2:17 in reference to false prophets:  </p>

<p class="verse">These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is <span class="underline">reserved</span> for ever.  </p>

<p>This is just indicating that on the last day when the
unsaved individuals who brought other kinds of gospels experience the judgment
of God and are destroyed, they will experience an eternal destruction, which is
how God describes annihilation in the book of Jude where He calls it &ldquo;the
blackness of darkness for ever.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Try to imagine how you would describe an eternal
annihilation.  What would be the best description of nothing?  How would you
describe nothing?  The best way is to close your eyes and to picture blackness,
which is the way that God describes this in the Bible.  It is the &ldquo;mist of
darkness&rdquo; forever or the &ldquo;blackness of darkness&rdquo; forever, and this is kept or
reserved for those who are not God&rsquo;s elect and yet they are involved in the Gospel. 
They are ministers of the Gospel or teachers of the Gospel, and yet they
themselves are not children of God.  </p>

<p>This is why 2Peter 2:19 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
servants of corruption&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is just a very accurate description of the overwhelming
majority of teaching out there in the Christian world.  This is 100% in the
churches, but this is also in ministries outside of the churches.  This is
delivered like a promise, and the degree of promises concerning eternal life
are just overwhelming, &ldquo;If you do this or that, if you walk down this aisle, if
you accept Christ, if you say the sinner&rsquo;s prayer, if you get baptized, if you
regularly attend our church and follow our confession and creeds, then the
result is that you will have liberty; you will have freedom, you will have
life.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But the ones promising this are themselves &ldquo;the servants of
corruption.&rdquo;  They are still in the bondage of sin and under the wrath of God. 
They cannot even get themselves freed from this predicament, and yet they are
daring to promise others life.  This is just a horrible thing that is going on
in the Christian world today.  </p>

<p>Going back to 1Peter 1:4, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible...reserved in heaven for you,  </p>

<p>The child of God, the one who is a true believer, has
tremendous security, hope, confidence and assurance regarding salvation.  </p>

<p>Speaking of something reserved, it is getting near
summertime when a lot of people make reservations for their summer vacations. 
If you have a family and you have discussed vacation plans with the family and
you talk about a possible destination, if you have young children especially,
they probably want to know whether or not you made a reservation.  This becomes
much more real to them if a reservation has been made.  Then they get very
excited.  The real issue is, &ldquo;Did you make the reservation?&rdquo;  There is security
for the children when a reservation is made.  It is then that they begin to
believe that they are actually going to get to go there, and this is because
the reservation has been made.  </p>

<p>Just discussing things and not making a reservation means
that you probably will not even end up going, and they realize this.  Plus, a
lot of times when you make a reservation, what does the hotel require?  For
whatever kind of plans that you are making, they require either a down payment
or a deposit.  </p>

<p>God has basically used this idea regarding our eternal
inheritance.  In Ephesians 1, we read about this.  God does this because He
knows how frail and weak we are and how quickly troubled we can get.  He tells
us in Ephesians 1:10-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather
together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are
on earth; <i>even </i>in him: In whom [<i>Christ</i>] also we have obtained an
inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh
all things after the counsel of his own will: That we should be to the praise
of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also <i>trusted, </i>after
that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also
after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which
is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession, unto the praise of his glory.  </p>

<p>This is really quite a bit of information that God is giving
us in these verses; but, again, this is referring to the inheritance that is
given to the children of God.  Notice that He says that we were &ldquo;sealed with
that holy Spirit of promise.&rdquo;  The Holy Spirit seals the individual who is one
of God&rsquo;s elect.  </p>

<p>Prior to salvation, that individual (who had always been one
of God&rsquo;s elect) did not have the Holy Spirit seal him.  They had to wait for
the fullness of time according to God&rsquo;s plan for their life.  At some point in
that person&rsquo;s life, God brought the Gospel to them and saved them.  In
salvation, the Holy Spirit enters into this individual and indwells them.  </p>

<p>This indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a wonderful thing. 
One of the things that it is is a promise that God has purchased them, that He
has redeemed them, that He has paid for their sins, that He has saved them; and
yet we tend to think that salvation is just receiving a new heart and a new
spirit.  </p>

<p>This is part of salvation.  This is one part and this is a
big part of salvation.  The Bible calls it &ldquo;the first resurrection,&rdquo; and yet
salvation is not complete when we just receive a new heart and a new spirit. 
Salvation is completed when we receive our new body, a resurrected body.  This
is the second resurrection.  </p>

<p>So God saves a person.  He takes out their heart of stone
and He gives them a heart of flesh.  He has His Spirit within that individual
now and He has sealed that individual; that is, it is now absolutely certain
that God has placed His seal on that person and that this person will not die
the death of other men.  This person will not cease to exist and be annihilated. 
This individual will live forever.  </p>

<p>This is part of the promise; but also, this person is
guaranteed to receive a new resurrected body and to enter into the new heavens
and the new earth and to live and dwell with God forevermore.  All of the
promises of the Bible, all of the glorious things that the Bible tells us about
eternity future, are now promised to that person and the Holy Spirit is
basically a down payment of these promises.  </p>

<p>This is why it says in Ephesians 1:14, which is referring
back to the &ldquo;holy Spirit of promise&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which is the <span class="underline">earnest</span> of our inheritance until the
redemption of the purchased possession&hellip;  </p>

<p>We have heard of earnest money.  If you are buying a house,
you put a down payment on the house.  This is a good analogy and a good way of
comparing what God is saying here.  He has purchased the individual and
redeemed them and given the Holy Spirit as a down payment on the future
fulfillment of the promise.  </p>

<p>We also find this word in 2Corinthians 1:22.  It says in 2Corinthians 1:20-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">For all the promises of God in him <i>are </i>yea&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, it is positive that they will be fulfilled, and
this is referring to Jesus.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. Now he which
stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, <i>is </i>God; Who
hath also sealed us, and given the <span class="underline">earnest</span> of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>

<p>Notice again that in the context of all of the promises of
God, we read of the Holy Spirit sealing us and giving us &ldquo;the earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts,&rdquo; because this is basically God&rsquo;s oath.  This is His
assurance and His absolute guarantee.  </p>

<p>If you or I or if any believer out there has experienced
salvation, if we have experienced a new birth, and if we have seen evidence of
this in our lives, if God has granted us assurance of this and we just know by
God&rsquo;s grace that He has saved us, this salvation or this knowledge that the
Holy Spirit indwells us gives us complete confidence in all of the other
promises of the Bible, the promises of God concerning the future.  The Holy
Spirit assures us, since He is within us, that just as God gave us this
tremendous salvation, He will fulfill all other things.  </p>

<p>Of course, now the question is when.  Let us say that we are
here for twenty more years.  This is nothing in comparison to the eternity to
come.  Any length of time is nothing in comparison with eternal blessings and
riches; and so the child of God has all things in his favor if he has &ldquo;the
earnest of the Spirit,&rdquo; if the Holy Spirit is within him.  </p>

<p>There is also another verse in 2Corinthians that speaks of
the earnest.  It says in 2Corinthians 5:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For we know that if our earthly house of <i>this </i>tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed
upon with our house which is from heaven: If so be that being clothed we shall
not be found naked. For we that are in <i>this </i>tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality
might be swallowed up of life. Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame
thing <i>is </i>God, who also hath given unto us the <span class="underline">earnest</span> of the
Spirit. Therefore <i>we are </i>always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:  </p>

<p>Do you see how God refers to the children of God having &ldquo;the
earnest of the Spirit,&rdquo; and how, because of this, we are &ldquo;always confident&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in 2Corinthians 5:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">We are confident, <i>I say, </i>and willing rather to be absent
from the body, and to be present with the Lord.  </p>

<p>So we are confident that if we were to die today, tomorrow,
or anytime soon that we would go to be with the Lord and that we would begin to
experience more of the promises of God as we would await the fulfillment of the
body.  We are confident that we would receive that resurrected body and so on,
and this confidence stems from and is the result of the indwelling Spirit of
God.  This is what gives the believer this confidence.  </p>

<p>Let us return to 1<sup>st</sup> Peter in our study of
chapter one.  We will move on to verse 5.  It says in 1Peter 1:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who are <span class="underline">kept</span> by the power of God through faith unto
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.  </p>

<p>Even though the word &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; in verse 4 is also
translated as &ldquo;keep/kept,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;kept&rdquo; here in verse 5 is a completely
different Greek word.  This word is found four times in the New Testament.  One
place that I think is helpful is in Philippians 4:7.  We read in Philippians
4:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And
the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall <span class="underline">keep</span> your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>We see here the word for &ldquo;kept&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;keep.&rdquo; 
This is the action of God.  It is the &ldquo;peace of God,&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;peace of
God&rdquo;?  Christ is or peace, and it is the &ldquo;peace of God&rdquo; that keeps our hearts
and minds through Christ Jesus.  God is the one who does this, and God is the
one in 1Peter 1:5 who tells us that our inheritance (the tremendously bountiful
spiritual blessings that we receive in Christ) is kept by the power of God. 
This, again, addresses the great security of these spiritual riches that await
each child of God, each sinner who has been given, by the grace of God, such a
goodly (to use a word) salvation plan.  </p>

<p>I would like to take a look and do a word study on the word
&ldquo;power&rdquo; in 1Peter 1:5.  I think as we do, we are going to learn something about
Matthew 24, because this word is found in Matthew 24.  I do not think that we
have correctly understood what was being said in Matthew 24.  </p>

<p>So let us take a look at how the word &ldquo;power,&rdquo; which is the
Greek word <i>dunamis</i> (Strong&rsquo;s #1411), is used in several places; then we
will go over to Matthew 24 and we will see how it is used there.  </p>

<p>First, it says in Luke 5:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of
every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the <span class="underline">power</span> of the
Lord was <i>present </i>to heal them.  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;power&rdquo; is that same Greek word <i>dunamis</i>. 
Notice that this is referring to healing.  When Jesus would do healings, like
when a leper was cleansed or when the blind could see or the lame could walk, we
know that this pointed to salvation.  They were true historical and physical
healings, but those healings typified the spiritual healing that comes with
salvation as God heals the sin-sick.  </p>

<p>In the same book, in Luke 9:1-2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them <span class="underline">power</span>
and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. And he sent them to preach
the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.  </p>

<p>Again, this is the same Greek word <i>dunamis</i>.  The
twelve were given power and authority over devils and to cure diseases.  The
disciples went out, which is a picture of the sending forth of the Gospel as
the Word of God has power to heal, power to cast out devils.  Again,
spiritually, this would typify salvation.  </p>

<p>It says in Romans 1:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the <span class="underline">power</span>
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also
to the Greek.  </p>

<p>Again, we read that the Gospel of Christ is the power of
God; and so, one way that we could describe the Gospel would be to use a
synonym that the Bible presents, which is that the Gospel is the &ldquo;power of
God.&rdquo;  The Bible even tells us what power it possesses.  It possesses the power
&ldquo;unto salvation.&rdquo;  The power of the Gospel is that it can bring salvation to
sinners.  </p>

<p>This verse is direct in its statement and we are getting a
better understanding of the word <i>dunamis</i>.  This word actually involves
many aspects of God&rsquo;s power.  It could describe certain things.  For instance,
in 1Peter 1:5, the inheritance that is reserved in Heaven is:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;kept by the <span class="underline">power</span> of God&hellip;  </p>

<p>Salvation could be in view here, but it also involves other
attributes of God because there are also a couple of other things that are
involved with this word <i>dunamis</i>.  The &ldquo;power of God&rdquo; is the Gospel of
salvation &ndash; it is the power of God unto salvation &ndash; as well as the sending
forth of this Gospel, the preaching of this Gospel.  </p>

<p>We see this even further in 1Corinthians 1:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the <span class="underline">power</span> of God.  </p>

<p>This is another direct statement, like we found in Romans
1:16.  Here it says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the preaching of the cross&hellip;is the <span class="underline">power</span> of God.  </p>

<p>There is a lot of preaching of the cross today, but it lacks
the power of God.  God even addresses this elsewhere in the New Testament; but
still, the true preaching of the cross or when the Bible is taught faithfully
and when truth is proclaimed, it is the power of God, the <i>dunamis</i> of
God.  </p>

<p>Further down in 1Corinthians 1:23-25, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; But unto them which are called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ the <span class="underline">power</span> of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the
foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than
men.  </p>

<p>Christ Himself is called the &ldquo;power of God,&rdquo; and we always
have to keep in mind that Jesus is &ldquo;the Word&hellip;made flesh.&rdquo;  Christ is the Word
made flesh, and if we were to search where Christ was (and Christ is the power
of God), we would go to the Bible.  On every page of the Bible, we could say,
&ldquo;Here is Christ, the power of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So the preaching of the cross is the power of God, the
Gospel unto salvation is the power of God, and Christ, the Word, the Bible
itself, is the power of God.  </p>

<p>In 1Corinthians 2:4-5, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And my speech and my preaching <i>was </i>not with enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of <span class="underline">power</span>: That
your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the <span class="underline">power</span> of
God.  </p>

<p>This is in relation to Paul&rsquo;s preaching as God moved him to write
these words.  </p>

<p>Let us just look at a couple more verses, and there are
others.  For now, let us look at 1Thessalonians 1.  It also uses this word <i>dunamis</i>. 
We read in 1Thessalonians 1:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in <span class="underline">power</span>,
and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we
were among you for your sake.  </p>

<p>Let us go to one last place to look at this word before we
go to Matthew 24.  Look at Hebrews 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who being the brightness of <i>his </i>glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his <span class="underline">power</span>,
when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high;  </p>

<p>We read here again of the &ldquo;word of his power,&rdquo; the Word of
God.  Scripture or the Bible is the power of God.  </p>

<p>A little further along in Hebrews, we actually read about
the Word.  It tells us that the Word is &ldquo;quick [<i>living</i>] and powerful.&rdquo;  The
word  in this verse in Hebrews that was translated as &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; is a different
Greek word, but it is definitely the same idea.  </p>

<p>The Word of God is the power of God and the Gospel is &ldquo;the
power of God unto salvation.&rdquo;  It was His will in the Great Commission that
people would preach the Gospel to all creatures.  It would be shared with all
mankind.  Then according to God&rsquo;s will and according to His plan of election, this
would bring spiritual healing to those whom God intended to save.  All of these
things are included in this word <i>dunamis</i>, the power of God.  </p>

<p>When we go to Matthew 24:29, we find that this says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven&hellip;  </p>

<p>Is this to be taken literally?  Will the sun be darkened and
will the moon not give its light and will the stars fall?  We have gone over
this many times.  </p>

<p>No; it is impossible for this to be literal.  This is
because Mark 13:24-25 tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, And the stars of heaven shall
fall&hellip;  </p>

<p>So Mark 13:24 looks at a period of time after the
tribulation, a period that it calls &ldquo;days.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Think about stars falling from the sky.  It says in Revelation
6, &ldquo;And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So for a science trivia question, how many stars would it
take to fall to the earth before the earth was completely obliterated?  The
answer is not even one; because before one star got anywhere near the earth,
the earth would melt with a fervent heat.  This is because stars are intensely
hot and very enormous.  One star would destroy the earth long before it reached
us.  </p>

<p>Spiritually speaking, this must mean then that immediately
after the tribulation, these strange events will take place in the celestial
bodies.  This must be spiritual, because after the tribulation it says that
this will be taking place for &ldquo;days&rdquo; in Mark 13:24.  God also helps us further
when He tells us in Luke 21:25, which is a parallel passage:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is indicating that this will be a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; of something
and not a reality.  The sign just points to the reality, and the reality is the
darkening of the Gospel lights.  </p>

<p>So the question that all of us are faced with is when the
tribulation ended.  When did the tribulation end?  If the tribulation ended on May 21, 2011, then the Gospel lights were put out.  If, however, there is a lengthening of
the tribulation, then this would not be for some time.  </p>

<p>We find all sorts of people arguing that there is still
salvation, but they are not addressing what took place on May 21.  They do not
tell us if the tribulation ended or if the tribulation is continuing.  They do
not tell us many, many things.  No questions are answered.  We are just
expected to adopt this and pressure is put on us to adopt this just because
they believe that we must; and yet this is not what the believer does.  The
child of God waits on the Lord.  The questions must be answered.  </p>

<p>Let us finish reading Matthew 24:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  </p>

<p>The Greek word for &ldquo;powers&rdquo; here is <i>dunamis</i>, but why
is it in the plural form?  Why is it that God tells us that &ldquo;immediately after
the tribulation&rdquo; that &ldquo;the powers of the heavens shall be shaken&rdquo;?  What could
this mean?  </p>

<p>Could this be referring to the sun, moon, and stars?  We
know that these are not literal, so this has to also be spiritual itself.  When
we just looked at the word <i>dunamis</i>, we found that it has much to do with
preaching, with the sending forth of the Gospel, which is the &ldquo;power of God
unto salvation,&rdquo; with the Word of God, the Bible.  These are the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; of
God, &ldquo;the powers of the heavens.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is just as the sun, moon, and stars relate spiritually
as we realize that the sun represents the light of Christ, the moon represents
the law of God, the Bible, and the stars represent the true believers; and this
is interesting because this is exactly what we found with the word <i>dunamis</i>. 
<i>Dunamis</i>, the power of God, was involved in the sending forth of the true
believers.  <i>Dunamis</i> was involved with the Word of God, just like the
moon represents the law or the Word of God.  <i>Dunamis</i> was involved with
Christ Himself, just like the sun typifies the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>So we do see, spiritually, that <i>dunamis</i> has
everything to do with the light of the Gospel, with the salvation of God, with
the preaching of the salvation of God, with the sending forth of the Gospel
into the world; and now, &ldquo;Immediately after the tribulation&hellip;the powers of the
heavens shall be shaken.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We must honestly ask a question.  We search and we go to God
because there are some things that we just do not know right now.  There is
some confusion, and so we go to the Lord and we ask for wisdom, &ldquo;O Lord, what
is going on?  What are You doing?  What has happened since May 21 of last
year?  Can You please show us?&rdquo;  Yet we must be willing to accept what the
answer is.  We cannot dismiss possible answers.  We cannot say, &ldquo;Well, I will
accept everything but that there is no more salvation.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I am not saying this for now.  I want to go back, which I
have done, with an open mind and I want to look at what is going on, at what
God is teaching, and at what is spiritually happening right now.  I want an
open mind.  If God has a plan to save people still, fine; but we need to find
this information in the Bible.  We do not get this from outside of the Bible. 
We do not get this intuitively.  We do not get this from other individuals. 
This must come from the Bible itself.  </p>

<p>Is it not something that the Bible indicates that the power
of God has everything to do with the Bible, with the Gospel, with salvation and
with the sending forth of it?  It tells us that immediately after the
tribulation, these powers of the heavens will be shaken; and so this is
something that we must look at.  </p>

<p>Why is it that since May 21, there have been no tract
trips?  Why is it that true believers, faithful men and women, have been
sitting at home on Sundays and many other days during the week and not sharing
the Gospel?  Why are true believers not out there?  Why are they not bringing
forth the Gospel to the world?  Most of all, why do they not have a horrible
conscience about this?  Why are they not convicted in their souls, like they used
to be?  </p>

<p>I can speak from experience about this.  I remember how I
felt in the past when I could have handed out tracts for a couple of hours
standing on a street corner, but I did not.  If I went to a store and failed at
giving the person who was checking me out a tract, I would have been strongly
convicted in my mind as I walked out, &ldquo;Oh, I should have given that person a
tract.&rdquo;  Why is it that I and many others cannot not only give a tract to
someone like the person checking us out at the store, but also not have any
conscience about not spending any time whatsoever in not doing this for going
on close to a year now?  Why are believers seemingly content in not bringing
forth the Gospel to the world?  </p>

<p>If you remember, Family Radio was expanding for years and
years.  God was opening up doors left and right with new radio stations and
opportunities to share the Gospel.  Why has this expansion stopped?  Why is it
in Philadelphia where I live right outside of the city that when we turn to
WKDN 106.9 FM right now, there is no Family Radio?  Family Radio is off the air
here and I think also in parts of Maryland.  It has lost two major stations in
this area, and so on.  We could continue.  There is no forward expansion any
longer with the sending forth of the true Gospel into the world.  </p>

<p>Some people might say that this is just because of May 21
and a failed date.  They might say that this is why there are no tract trips
and that this is why people are not out there.  </p>

<p>Well, I was around in 1994.  In 1994, there was a prediction
about September of that year, and yet Family Radio continued with its tract
trips.  They had a core group in India all the way through that period.  I even
remember joining that core group in the summer of 1995 as the Gospel continued
to go out and as Family Radio continued to expand at that point and in the
years following.  </p>

<p>The time that we are now in is not similar.  This is not
because of a failed date.  God&rsquo;s people continually go back to the truth of the
Word and we always shared the Word because that is the desire that God had
placed within us.  </p>

<p>What has happened?  What happened on May 21, 2011?  Why is it that we had thought that May 21 would be the completion of the tribulation,
the 23 years and the full 8400 days?  Since that point, it certainly seems that
the powers of the heavens have been shaken because the Gospel power, the Bible,
is not going forth as it has been.  </p>

<p>We will continue to study and to pray for wisdom, but may we
all be willing to receive what God has for us.  We will stop here.  </p>
