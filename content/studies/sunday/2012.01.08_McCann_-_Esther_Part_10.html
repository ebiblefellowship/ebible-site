<p>Let us go back to Esther 5.  I will read the first five
verses.  It says in Esther 5:1-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on <i>her </i>royal
<i>apparel, </i>and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against
the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house,
over against the gate of the house. And it was so, when the king saw Esther the
queen standing in the court, <i>that </i>she obtained favour in his sight: and
the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that <i>was </i>in his hand. So
Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. Then said the king unto
her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what <i>is </i>thy request? it shall be
even given thee to the half of the kingdom. And Esther answered, If <i>it seem </i>good
unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I
have prepared for him. Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he
may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that
Esther had prepared.  </p>

<p>Again, it is the third day, which is what date on the
calendar of King Ahasuerus&rsquo; kingdom?  It is the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, and God makes sure that we understand that the banquet was that same
day, &ldquo;Come this day unto the banquet.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We found that once Esther made the statement that she had
not been called into the king &ldquo;these thirty days&rdquo; that God was very careful to
detail every day thereafter for those three days.  In Esther 5:1, he states,
&ldquo;Now it came to pass on the third day.&rdquo;  In Esther 5:4, He states that it was
&ldquo;this day&rdquo; that they came to the banquet.  He was very, very careful to make
sure that we know where we are after that point.  This is the 16<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>We have been seeing Esther as a type and figure of the true
believers because she is the bride of the king.  King Ahasuerus is a figure of
God.  He reigns over 127 provinces and Esther is his wife, but we were thinking
that there was a switch made here and that Esther becomes a figure of Christ. 
This was primarily because of the language of the three days of fasting and the
language of &ldquo;the third day,&rdquo; but there are some things that we have to think
about.  </p>

<p>Christ was three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth, which really points to Thursday night in the garden, then Friday night,
then Saturday night in the tomb; and then the three days were Friday, Saturday,
and then He rose on Sunday.  But God makes sure that we know that Christ did
this all alone.  Isaiah says, &ldquo;And I looked, and <i>there was </i>none to help;
and I wondered that <i>there was </i>none to uphold: therefore mine own arm
brought salvation unto me.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But here, Mordecai and all of the Jews fast with Esther and
her maids.  We could still think, though, that maybe this is a picture of all
of the believers being in Christ.  But more than that, when we get to the third
day, Esther presents herself before the king.  She does go into the inner
court, but she is not bearing sin in any way.  She is not doing as Christ did. 
Christ paid for the sins of His people before the foundation of the world and
then He demonstrated this in history in 33 A.D.  Not even in a figurative way
is she bearing sin that we can see.  She also goes into the inner court by
grace, not according to law.  Then as she approaches, she must find favor in
the king&rsquo;s sight; and then the king holds out his scepter.  </p>

<p>The second reason why we used to think that Esther was a
type of Christ was because she was interceding, which is the work of Christ. 
He is the intercessor on behalf of His people.  He is the One who goes to God
the Father.  He is the One who pleads for those whom He has saved, as we see in
Isaiah 53:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore will I divide him <i>a portion </i>with the great, and
he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul
unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of
many, and made intercession for the transgressors.  </p>

<p>Christ, who is in view here, bore the sin of many.  The only
time that He did this was before the world began.  Then it says that He made
intercession for them.  </p>

<p>As Christ experienced the wrath of God, He was doing this
for the elect&rsquo;s sake.  All of the sins that you and I are guilty of in our
lives &ndash; past, present, and future &ndash; were laid on Him, if we are a child of God,
before the world began.  God poured out His wrath and Jesus died to satisfy the
Law&rsquo;s demands for each one of His elect.  </p>

<p>So the penalty was completely paid.  It was one act of
intercession done and finished from before the foundation of the world.  All
was accomplished.  But in the book of Hebrews, the Bible does speak of Christ
continuing to intercede.  We read in Hebrews 7:24-27:  </p>

<p class="verse">But this <i>man, </i>because he continueth ever, hath an
unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
for them. For such an high priest became us, <i>who is </i>holy, harmless,
undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth
not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own
sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up
himself.  </p>

<p>So, again, Christ offered up Himself once and that was an
act of intercession; but then as it says in verse 25:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  </p>

<p>The way that I think we can understand this is that God
saved the whole company of the elect, every single one, before the world began;
but the history of the world had to unfold.  Each of these people had to be
born into the generations of the world all throughout history.  </p>

<p>When an individual would be born into the world and they
would come under the hearing of the Gospel, it was as if Christ was there
saying, &ldquo;Yes; this is one whom I paid for.&rdquo;  Then He would intercede with the
Father.  Then we could say that through the blood of Christ or through just the
hearing of the Gospel, God would save that individual and apply it.  The
application of redemption was made.  </p>

<p>Also, whenever these people sin after salvation, it is as
though God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is right there instantaneously interceding
with the Father and saying, &ldquo;I paid for that sin, too.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>I do not know how God works this out, but we could imagine
how often this would be done, even though God does not need reminding.  They
are One; they know the elect; they know that all of their sins are paid for. 
In this sense, it is a constant reinforcement that all the sins of every child
of God were completely paid for; and so, &ldquo;He ever liveth to make intercession
for them.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is why we have that great security of eternal life.  It
is because our eternal life can never be taken away.  Our sins have been
completely paid for and Christ will live forever to declare this, to make this
statement.  </p>

<p>Is Esther a type of Christ then because He is the
intercessor?  No; we have to look at everything.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Romans 8:26.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  </p>

<p>So the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, makes intercession
for us on our behalf; and yet God is speaking of our prayers, &ldquo;We know not what
we should pray for.&rdquo;  He is talking about the child of God.  We are going to
Him in prayer.  We are going to Him beseeching Him and we do not know what we
should pray for.  We really do not, do we?  We have some idea, maybe a little
bit, but we do not know exactly what to pray for; and so the Holy Spirit, the
Spirit of God, helps us and intercedes on our behalf to God &ldquo;with groanings
which cannot be uttered.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then look at the next verse, Romans 8:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what <i>is </i>the mind
of the Spirit, because he [<i>the Spirit</i>] maketh intercession for the
saints according to <i>the will of </i>God.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what Esther was doing.  She was going before
the king to make intercession.  Yes, she made intercession on behalf of
herself, but she also made intercession on behalf of all of the Jewish people
in the kingdom.  She was going to the king and beseeching him that they might
live, which would mean that she would live.  </p>

<p>We can see how God, of course, was completely involved in
this.  The Holy Spirit leads His people to prayer.  He leads us to go to the
Father and to cry out to Him.  More than this, He even makes intercession when
we do this on behalf of the saints.  </p>

<p>So Esther was the bride of King Ahasuerus, which clearly
typifies the relationship between the Father or Christ and the church, but she
does not go into the king according to law; she goes in according to grace. 
When she goes in, she finds favor.  </p>

<p>Going back to Esther 5:2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
the court, <i>that </i>she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out
to Esther the golden sceptre&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;favor&rdquo; is like the word &ldquo;grace.&rdquo;  The king could
have put her to death.  That was the law, and God can put any of us to death
because we have broken the Law.  Esther broke the law.  If she went into that
inner chamber, she could die.  </p>

<p>Is it not something that in the law of the Medes of the
Persians, they made a provision for grace?  They made allowance for the king to
grant favor.  </p>

<p>This very much pictures the Law of God.  Within the Law of
God, we have language that tells us that God can be merciful.  He can be
gracious to sinners.  He can pardon iniquity; but, of course, this is only done
through Christ.  </p>

<p>This is the thing.  If Esther is a picture of Christ, how
can the king bestow grace?  The Father bestowing grace to Christ does not match
up.  Esther is going in and she is finding grace.  Also, it is not just a
matter of three days and there is no payment for sin involved.  There is a
fourth day, which is the second day of the banquet.  This means that several
things do not add up and it does fit when we see Esther as a picture of the
believers.  </p>

<p>So Esther comes in and she touches the golden scepter of the
king.  In relation to this, let us look at Hebrews 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But unto the Son <i>he saith, </i>Thy throne, O God, <i>is </i>for
ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness <i>is </i>the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>

<p>So this scepter represents the righteousness of God,
Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.  This is where she is finding grace.  This is how the
king can grant her favor and, spiritually, how God can pardon sinners.  </p>

<p>She comes before the king, which is a place that, by law,
she cannot be.  She touches the scepter, which indicates the righteousness of
the Lord Jesus.  The Bible tells us that He is righteousness Himself.  In this
sense, it is as though God is imparting the righteousness of Christ to her,
thereby allowing her to live and to make her plea, to be able now to beseech
Him and to make her request.  In her intercession, we can understand that this
is being done through the Holy Sprit and by the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>Again, let us look at the spiritual chronology of Esther. 
It is going from Vashti, who represents national Israel, and then she is put
away in Esther 1.  Then the virgins are gathered unto Shushan.  The Gospel went
out into the world and the believers came in, who are typified by virgins. 
These virgins were gathered to Christ, which Shushan represents.  </p>

<p>At the end of Esther 2, two doorkeepers are killed.  These
two doorkeepers were rebels who wanted to usurp the king, and these two
doorkeepers are a picture of the New Testament church and the end of the church
age.  They are hung and made an open shame, and they came under the judgment of
the king, just like the church came under the judgment of God on May 21, 1988.  </p>

<p>In Esther 3, Haman is advanced.  He is promoted.  His seat
is lifted up above all of the other princes.  This is in conjunction with the
death of the two doorkeepers.  Spiritually, this represents the loosing of
Satan as he takes his seat as the &ldquo;man of sin&rdquo; in the temple.  </p>

<p>As chapter 3 goes on, we find that Mordecai will not bow
down.  This relates to Revelation 13 when an image comes up and then an image
is made to the beast.  It actually says that whoever will not bow down should
be killed.  This is why Haman was so furious with Mordecai and the people of
Mordecai.  </p>

<p>This was indicating that Christ and His people or the Holy
Spirit within His people will not bow down to Satan who has taken his seat as
the &ldquo;man of sin&rdquo; in the churches and congregations.  After all, Satan could
reason, &ldquo;God has put me here.  God has given me authority,&rdquo; just like King
Ahasuerus lifted up Haman.  It is true and so Satan feels that we should bow
down, but God&rsquo;s people will not bow down.  </p>

<p>As we continue, we then see that Esther 3 is representing
the time of the great tribulation.  During that period of time, there is a
proclamation made to the world, all 127 provinces, of a day of judgment.  There
will be a day when the Jews were to be killed.  </p>

<p>When we look at this spiritually, what did they hear?  They
heard that the fullness of time had come, which was related to two numbers &ndash;
number 12 and number 13.  The number 12 represents the fullness of time, and
the number 13 represents the end of the world.  </p>

<p>This is the message that all of the Jews in all 127
provinces heard.  As a result of hearing this, they were broken in heart and
sitting in sackcloth and ashes along with Mordecai, which is what happened to
God&rsquo;s elect who were all scattered throughout the world when they heard the
message of Judgment Day.  Then we saw that God has actually placed in the book
of Esther, following this, a spiritual chronology that leads right up to May
21, the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>By the way, this is only valid until 2012.  There is an
expiration date, because our link is not through years.  It is through the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  This is where God is tying this in.  It is
with the flood and with May 21.  </p>

<p>Once this is locked in, and it is, then it is like we are in
the midst of the book of Esther when Haman dies, and then the next thing is the
13<sup>th</sup> day of the 12<sup>th</sup> month.  It does not apply to 2013 or
2014 because the lock with this is with May 21; then this time is followed by
the next Feast of Purim.  It only applies to 2012.  That is the only connection
that we have.  If March 2012 were to come and go, what would it mean that Haman
was killed on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month?  If we tried
relating this to May 21 of 2013, that would not mean anything.  It is only
valid really at this time as we look ahead to the next date of Purim, which
would be in March of this year, only a couple of months away.  </p>

<p>Then we saw the intense fasting leading right up until the
time that Esther goes into the king; and we can see how this relates.  She is
going before the king and the spiritual chronology of this is right before May
21.  </p>

<p>I do not like doing this, because we cannot look at outward
events and then place them into the Bible.  People can get into trouble trying
to do this.  However, when we learn something from the Bible &ndash; for example, we
see language of the fig tree being in leaf again &ndash; and then we look out into
the world &ndash; and after almost 2,000 years, Israel became a nation again &ndash; we see
that it matches.  But we would never want to do the reverse by looking out into
the world and then trying to find something in the Bible that matches.  </p>

<p>But let me ask you something.  What were you doing on May 20<sup>th</sup>
for yourself, for your family, for your friends, for the world?  What were you
doing?  </p>

<p>Many, many, many of God&rsquo;s elect were going to God in prayer
in a sincere and serious way like they had never done before.  We approached Him
like Esther.  Many of us did not even know if we were elect.  I remember
meeting many people who were getting the Gospel out.  They believed all of
these things, but they just did not have that assurance.  But many were
approaching God for themselves and for their families.  I know that parents
were praying deeply for their children and for people whom they knew.  </p>

<p>Then prayers were also being offered up for those in China
and in India and in Africa.  All over the world, people were praying for God&rsquo;s
elect.  God&rsquo;s elect all over the world were praying because we believed it.  We
knew that it was going to happen.  We knew that Judgment Day was coming.  We
thought that the door to Heaven was shutting, and we were correct.  </p>

<p>We were correct because that was May 21 and May 21 was the
equivalent date to when the flood came and to when the door shut, and so God&rsquo;s
people were making intercession.  We were pleading on behalf of the spiritual
Jews in all of the kingdom, in all 127 provinces or in all of the world.  </p>

<p>So God here is indicating that Esther, who I think typifies
the believers, found favor in His sight.  Then look at what He says in Esther
5:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
what <i>is </i>thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the
kingdom.  </p>

<p>This represents that the king will grant Esther&rsquo;s request,
but this does not mean that God granted our request for each individual whom we
prayed for.  They might not have been a Jew spiritually; but for every
spiritual Jew whom we were praying for, God granted our request.  He gave them
deliverance and He spared them.  We do not actually read about the request here
but this is the request that we know about on the second day of the banquet,
which was the fourth day or the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Proverbs 10:24 in relation to our petition
being brought to God.  We read in Proverbs 10:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
of the righteous shall be granted.  </p>

<p>Esther touched the tip of the king&rsquo;s scepter.  It was a
righteous scepter.  She was granted the righteousness of Christ.  </p>

<p>We know that Jesus is the righteous One and that &ldquo;by the
obedience of one shall many be made righteous.&rdquo;  All of God&rsquo;s elect became
righteous and &ldquo;the desire of the righteous shall be granted.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we prayed according to the will of God for the salvation
of individuals who happened to be God&rsquo;s elect, God heard this.  He granted it
and He applied the Word to their hearts and redeemed them and they became born
again.  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Esther 5:6.  It says:   </p>

<p class="verse">And the king said unto Esther at the <span class="underline">banquet</span> of wine&hellip;    </p>

<p>By the way, this is a &ldquo;banquet of wine,&rdquo; and the word
&ldquo;banquet&rdquo; is also translated as &ldquo;feast/feasted/feasting.&rdquo;  It is the same word
that is used in Esther 1 a few times.  For example, we read in Esther 1:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the third year of his reign, he made a <span class="underline">feast</span> unto all
his princes and his servants&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word is used a couple more times in this passage in
Esther 1.  This is the same word that is used in Esther 5 that is translated as
&ldquo;banquet&rdquo; and it is a &ldquo;banquet of wine.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Finally at the second banquet of wine, Haman is going to
die.  Keep in mind the king of Babylon in the book of Daniel and what happened
to him at the end of 70 years.  At the end of 70 years, what happened?  The
king saw the writing on the wall.  He was drinking wine with a thousand of his
lords and it says that the queen came into the banquet house.  So that king was
at a banquet of wine.  Daniel interprets the writing; then later that same
night, the king dies.  The king of Babylon died at a banquet of wine at the end
of 70 years, exactly as Haman will die at a banquet of wine on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month.  </p>

<p>This leads me to think along the lines of God giving the cup
of the wine of His wrath to Haman on that day, because it was Judgment Day.  We
will see this clearer as we go on; but May 21 was Judgment Day.  This is
confirmation, as we read this in Esther.  No; it was not the rapture and it was
not a great earthquake, but it was Judgment Day for Haman.  It was Judgment Day
for the enemies of God and it was the salvation of all of God&rsquo;s elect.  </p>

<p>Also, as Esther intercedes and the king does finally grant
her request for the Jews on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month, all of the Jews in all of the provinces are delivered on the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month without exception.  There is not one Jew who
had to be delivered later.  All of the Jews were really saved by the action of
the Holy Spirit interceding through Esther, who typifies the believers who
brought the Gospel to the world.  Each and every one of the Jews in all of the
kingdom finds deliverance on that day.  It was just a matter of actually
working this out until the 12<sup>th</sup> month when that day would come, but
that day itself was really when the intercession was made and the petition was
granted.  </p>

<p>Going back to Esther 5:6-8, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What <i>is
</i>thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what <i>is </i>thy request?
even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. Then answered Esther,
and said, My petition and my request <i>is;</i> If I have found favour in the
sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to
perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall
prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.  </p>

<p>This is all we know about this first banquet.  Why did
Esther do this?  Maybe she was fearful.  Maybe she just wanted some early
indicators that the king was favorable towards her.  I do not know; but we do
know that as a result of this, the next day will be the 17<sup>th</sup> day of
the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, which is the equivalent date to May 21 that was
Judgment Day.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in Esther 5:9-6:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but
when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for
him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. Nevertheless Haman refrained
himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh
his wife. And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of
his children, and all <i>the things </i>wherein the king had promoted him, and
how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. Haman said
moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the
banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her
also with the king. Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
the Jew sitting at the king's gate. Then said Zeresh his wife and all his
friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow
speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in
merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he
caused the gallows to be made. On that night could not the king sleep, and he
commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read
before the king. And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought
to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. And the king said, What honour and dignity
hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. And the king said, Who <i>is
</i>in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's
house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had
prepared for him.  </p>

<p>A few people have been saying that Satan knows all about the
end; but, surprisingly, Haman had no clue that he was about to die.  He went in
thinking, &ldquo;I am going to talk to the king to have Mordecai, my arch enemy, put
to death&rdquo; and the king probably would have granted this.  Earlier when Haman
requested the death of all of the Jews, including Mordecai, the king sold them,
&ldquo;Sure; it sounds good.&rdquo;  And yet that night, coincidentally, the king could not
sleep and so he has the record read of the account of the two doorkeepers,
Bigthana and Teresh, who were rebels.  They were put to death because Mordecai
informed Esther of this and she certified this in his name to the king.  </p>

<p>So here is Haman and it seems that he has no idea of what is
about to happen.  He has his plans, but they are completely thwarted and turned
around.  The next thing he knows, he is walking down the streets of Shushan
parading Mordecai around on horseback and declaring, &ldquo;Thus shall it be done
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.&rdquo;  This was how Haman&rsquo;s day began
and it only got worse from there.  </p>

<p>I think that we can safely say that we do not know all that
Satan is aware of, but here, since Haman represents Satan, Satan seems to have
some definite ideas about May 21 that did not go his way.  God changed things
on him and brought judgment upon him.  I think that we can say this.  </p>

<p>The other thing I want to make note of before I stop is that
it was back in Esther 2 that Esther married the king in the 10<sup>th</sup>
month of his 7<sup>th</sup> year.  A little after that, probably in the 8<sup>th</sup>
year, or it could have been the 9<sup>th</sup> year since there are no details
of this, is when the two doorkeepers were found out.  </p>

<p>So this happened a couple of years before this at least.  It
could have been the 8<sup>th</sup> year and this is now the 12<sup>th</sup>
year.  It could have been two, three, or four years earlier when the
doorkeepers had made their plot against the king, but their death typifies the
end of the church age and the beginning of the great tribulation.  Then they
are completely out of mind for a period of a few years.  No mention is made of
them until the king cannot sleep on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
month.  Then the account is read of the two doorkeepers who represent the
church that came under the judgment of God, which we know was May 21, 1988.  </p>

<p>Amazingly, it was May 21, 2011, spiritually, that was
basically in view when the king was reminded about them and asks, &ldquo;What honor
and dignity has been done to Mordecai?&rdquo;  This was because Mordecai had revealed
their plot.  He revealed their unfaithfulness.  </p>

<p>In other words, God found out the sins of the church and He
brought judgment upon them.  Then on May 21, 2011, which happened to be the end
of the great tribulation and the last day of the judgment on the church, this
is brought to Ahasuerus&rsquo; mind, or to God&rsquo;s mind, that no honor or dignity had
been done to Mordecai, or to the Lord Jesus Christ, for bringing judgment on
the churches and congregations.  </p>

<p>The reason that Haman is taking Mordecai around the city on
horseback is to honor him for bringing judgment on the churches and that
judgment is now up because it is May 21.  It is a day of exaltation for Christ,
and Satan who had taken his seat of authority in the church is now abased.  He
is brought down and deposed and he is the one, like a servant, who is leading
Mordecai around on horseback.  </p>

<p>So another interesting thing that matches May 21 is that the
two doorkeepers are brought into remembrance on the morning of the 17<sup>th</sup>
day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month, and then the account will continue.  </p>

<p>We will continue on.  May 21 is going to be in focus until
Esther 8.  Then Esther 9 will get into Purim itself.  But the rest of the book
of Esther deals with Judgment Day and a little bit with the period thereafter
that we are currently in.  </p>

<p>I will stop here.  </p>
