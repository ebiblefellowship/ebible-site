# Did God Lie to Adam and Eve? Part 3

Adam and Eve did not die physically on the day they ate of the forbidden fruit.
But did they die? The answer is yes. Let's read from the book of Ephesians
2:1:

And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
{:.verse}

As a result of the sin to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil--Adam and Eve and all of mankind died that very day SPIRITUALLY.

Due to disobeying God they died in their soul existence. But, they did not die
physically just yet. Actually, the Bible tells us that Adam lived to be 930
years old before he died physically. Yes indeed, because of sin mankind dies
physically at some point. But mankind did not die physically "in the day" they
ate of that tree.

Now let's ask the all important question: did God lie to Adam and Eve when 
He told them that "in that day" you eat of the tree you will die? Did Satan 
tell them the truth when he said, "Ye shall not surely die?"

The answer is absolutely not! God cannot lie the Bible tells us. It was a true
statement--Adam and Eve did die "spiritually" as the Lord had said. God simply
did not give them all the information about what kind of death it would be. In
other words, the Lord brought about a spiritual judgment upon mankind, which
fulfilled His Word.
