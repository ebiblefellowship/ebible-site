<p>Let us look now at Revelation 9:14. It says there: </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
</p>

<p>In relationship to this language of loosing and binding,
turn to Matthew 18:18: </p>

<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven&hellip; </p>

<p>Actually, the tense would be &ldquo;having been bound in heaven.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Then it continues to say: </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven. </p>

<p>And, again, this would be &ldquo;having been loosed in heaven.&rdquo; </p>

<p>In the above Scripture, we find Christ setting up the
sending of the Gospel into the world throughout the New Testament Era. It is
through the Gospel that God&rsquo;s people could bind men; and it is through the
Gospel that men could be loosed. This is because it is the Word of God that
looses those who are in spiritual prison, those who are in spiritual captivity.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, we read in John 11:44 concerning the
resurrection of Lazarus: </p>

<p class="verse">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto
them, Loose him, and let him go. </p>

<p>Lazarus was dead and he was bound with graveclothes; but
here, Christ says, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth,&rdquo; and he is loosed. We can see that
salvation is definitely in view. Having once been bound and then loosed is
another way in which God points to salvation in the Bible. </p>

<p>We read in Luke 13:11-16: </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up <i>herself.</i>
And when Jesus saw her, he called <i>her to him, </i>and said unto her, Woman,
thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid <i>his </i>hands on her: and
immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. And the ruler of the
synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the
sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to
work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. The
Lord then answered him, and said, <i>Thou </i>hypocrite, doth not each one of
you on the sabbath loose his ox or <i>his </i>ass from the stall, and lead <i>him
</i>away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham,
whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on
the sabbath day?</p>

<p>Once again, we see this binding and loosing. Like this poor
woman, people are bound to Satan and to sin, and Christ looses them. </p>

<p>So we see in Revelation 9 that these four angels
(messengers) were bound in the great river Euphrates. The command is given to &ldquo;loose&rdquo;
them. We will see how the four messengers are representative of the 200 million
whom God will save out of this world.  The four messengers typify the sum total
of God&rsquo;s elect people: all those whose names were written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book of
Life. </p>

<p>Since the four messengers are synonymous with the 200
million horsemen, we could also say that 200 million were bound in the great
river Euphrates. These are the 200 million who were delivered and who came out
of spiritual bondage and captivity on that great day, the glorious day of May
21. </p>
