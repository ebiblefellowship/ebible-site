<h1>Study on the Number Five</h1><br /><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>God uses the number 5 in connection with both salvation and judgment. </p>

<h3>Examples Signifying Salvation </h3>

<p>Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves of bread <span class="verseref">(Matthew 16:9)</span>. The five thousand people represent those who are saved by partaking of the Bread of Life, which is Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.<span class="verseref"> (John 6:35)</span></p>

<p>Five shekels were paid for those who are to be redeemed. These individuals represent those who are saved:</p>
<p class="verse">And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. <span class="verseref">(Numbers 18:16) </span></p>

<h3>Examples Signifying Judgment </h3>

<p>We read about the five unsaved brothers who were still under God's judgment:</p>
<p class="verse">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come   into this place of torment. <span class="verseref">(Luke 16:28)</span> </p>

<p>The book of Revelation speaks of five months of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. <span class="verseref">(Revelation 9:5)</span></p>
<p class="verse">And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. <span class="verseref"> (Revelation 9:10) </span></p>

<h3>Examples Signifying Both Salvation And Judgment </h3>

<p>The five wise virgins of <span class="verseref">Matthew 25:1-13</span> represent those who are ready to meet God (the saved). The five foolish virgins represent those who aren't ready to meet God (the unsaved who are still under the judgment of God). </p>

<p>David chose five stones when going to battle with Goliath <span class="verseref">(1 Samuel 17:40)</span>. This signifies the judgment of God that was about to come upon Goliath (who is heading up those that oppose God's people) and it also signifies the salvation that is about to be brought to Israel.</p>
