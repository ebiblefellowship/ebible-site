<h1>Israel&rsquo;s Declaration of Independance on May 15, 1948</h1>

<p>Israel signed their Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. The Declaration
states that the British Mandate governing Palestine would remain in effect until
midnight (May 15), and at that time the interim government of Israel would begin
to rule. So the first &ldquo;official&rdquo; day of statehood for Israel was Saturday May
15, 1948. Mr. Camping stated this was the day of Pentecost. Pentecost day began
on the evening of May 15th. Mr. Camping alluded to this first &ldquo;official&rdquo; day but
did not say the date.</p>

<p>This is not a coincidence, this is another example of the precision that God has
used in unfolding the timeline of history tied to the ceremonial feast days. The
final 40 year test for Israel began on the day of Pentecost in 1948 and ended
the day before Pentecost in 1988, the same day that God was finished with the
churches and the tribulation began, at which time BOTH keepers of the vineyard
would fall under the judgment of God.</p>

<p>This 40-year period can be viewed as exactly 40 years. The church age began on
Pentecost in AD 33 and ended the day before Pentecost in AD 1988. That was an
exact 1955-year period. Likewise, the final testing period for Israel, and the
final 40 years of the vineyard under the care of the churches, began on
Pentecost AD 1948 and ended the day before Pentecost in AD 1988.</p>

<p>There is an amazing parallel to this, which took place at the Exodus, the
official beginning of the vineyard (Isa 5 1-7, Psalm 80:8-9, 15). Exactly 40
years after the Exodus, God commanded Joshua to arise and enter Canaan in three
days (Josh 1:11). Thus the vineyard began with an exact 40-year period and ended
with an exact 40-year period. This is another testimony to the amazing precision
of design that God has used to unfold His salvation plan.</p>
