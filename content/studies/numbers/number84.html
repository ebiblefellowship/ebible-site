<h1>The Number 84</h1>
<h2 class="teacher">by Robin Harp</h2>
<p>The number 84 is seen in the duration of the great tribuation.  Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jacob&rsquo;s tribulation - 1st historical type of the great tribulation was from 1879 B.C. to 1872 B.C. = 7 years X 12 months = 84 months</li>
  <li>Judah&rsquo;s tribulation - 2nd historical type of the great tribulation was from 609 B.C. to 539 B.C. = 70 years X 12 months = 840 months</li>
  <li>Today&rsquo;s tribulation - 3rd and actual great tribulation is from 1988 A.D. to 2011 A.D. = 23 years X 365.2422 days = 8400 days</li>
</ul>
