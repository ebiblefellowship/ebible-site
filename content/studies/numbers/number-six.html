<h1>Study on the Number Six</h1><br /><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>God often uses the number six in relation to work. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>God worked six days in creating this universe:</p>
<p class="verse">For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it
  <span class="verseref"> (Exodus 20:11)</span> </p>

<p>We are to do all of our weekly work in six days:</p>
<p class="verse">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work
  <span class="verseref"> (Exodus 20:9)</span></p>

<p>Six years were given to do all the work of planting and harvesting:</p>
<p class="verse">And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof
  <span class="verseref"> (Exodus  23:10)</span></p>

<p>Hebrew servants were supposed to be set free after working for six years:</p>
<p class="verse">If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
  <span class="verseref">(Exodus 21:2)</span></p>

<p>We also find the number six used in connection with Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross: It was the sixth hour when Christ was ordered to be crucified <span class="verseref">(John 19:14-15)</span>. It was the sixth hour when darkness fell upon all the earth just before Christ died. <span class="verseref">(Luke  23:44)</span></p>
