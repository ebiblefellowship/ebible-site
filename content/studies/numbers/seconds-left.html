title: Seconds Left

<h1>Seconds Left</h1>

<p>There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. 
There are, therefore, 60x60x24 = 86,400 seconds in a day.

<p>There are about 2 years left out of a total of 13,023 years for all of history.</p>

<p>So we now define two ratios which must equal one another. One is years left to 
total years, and the other is seconds left (which we&rsquo;ll call x) to seconds in a 
day. The two ratios, therefore, are:</p>

<pre><code>
   x:86400 and 2:13023
   
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s rewrite these as fractions so that we can do math operations on them:</p>

<pre><code>
     x       2
   ----- = -----
   86400   13023
   
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s cross-multiply in order to isolate x:</p>

<pre><code>
       2x86400
   x = -------
        13023
		
</code></pre>

<p>This simplifies to:</p>

<pre><code>
       172800
   x = ------
        13023
		
</code></pre>

<p>Which finally simplifies to:</p>

<pre><code>
   x = 13.27
   
</code></pre>

<p>The number 13.27 is close enough to 13.25, so we can safely say, in simple language, that 
there are the equivalent of 13 and a quarter seconds left.</p>
