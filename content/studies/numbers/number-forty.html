<h1>Study on the Number Forty</h1><br /><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>If the number 40 has spiritual significance it would seem to be related to testing.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Jesus was tested for 40 days by God through the use of Satan:</p>
<p class="verse">Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days   and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. 
  <span class="verseref">(Matthew 4:1-2)</span></p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
  <span class="verseref">(Luke 4:1-2)</span></p>

<p>The Israelites were tested for 40 years in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep is commandments, or no. 
  <span class="verseref"> (Deuteronomy 8:2) </span></p>

<p>Ninevah was given 40 days&rsquo; notice of destruction to test if they would repent:</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
  <span class="verseref">(Jonah 3:4-5)</span></p>

<p>The raining for 40 days and 40 nights in Noah&rsquo;s day pointed to a test that focuses on believing what we read in the Bible about Christ&rsquo;s return:</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished
