<p>Hello and welcome.  The Bible clearly teaches that there
will be an end of the world.  This teaching is found in many parts of the
Bible.  For instance, it says in 2 Peter 3:10-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
shall be burned up.<i> Seeing </i>then <i>that </i>all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner <i>of persons </i>ought ye to be in <i>all </i>holy
conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day
of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look
for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.  </p>

<p>This is typical of many statements in the Bible.  God has
not tried to hide this information.  He has made it abundantly clear and plain
that due to man&rsquo;s sin and his fallen corrupt nature, the Lord will bring
judgment on man and also on the whole creation by destroying it.  Then God will
speak and create a new heaven and a new earth where He, the Lord God, will
dwell with His people forevermore.  </p>

<p>This is what the Bible teaches.  As a result, God commands
mankind not to love the world, not to get too attached to the things of this
world; but rather, have our hearts, our desires, and our affections on things
above.  May our treasure be in Heaven and not on this earth.  </p>

<p>The reason for this is because the earth will not last
forever.  Mankind only spends a few short years here on this earth as it is.  During
the best of circumstances, a man may live seventy or eighty years.  Of course,
there are some who live more and some who live less.  But generally, a man may
live this length of time and then that will be it and anything he enjoyed in
this life will be taken from him.  </p>

<p>This is why God tells us to go to Him and to beseech Him for
mercy that we might find grace and that we might be given the gift of eternal
life, which is life that is real life, genuine life, a life that is not but for
a short moment.  It is a life that is forever and ever.  </p>

<p>The Bible has always told its reader, mankind, that this day
would come.  This has always been a promise of God&rsquo;s, and all of God&rsquo;s promises
do come to pass.  They are fulfilled; therefore, there must be a time when this
would be fulfilled.  There must be a time when there would be a last generation
upon this earth.  There must be a people who would be born during a time when
they would not be able to experience a life like the life of their fathers or
their fathers before them.  This is because in their time, it would be the
end.  </p>

<p>After hearing information from the Bible that May 21, 2011 will be the date of the Rapture and Judgment Day itself, some people say, &ldquo;Well,
it is not fair!  Why now?  Why during my lifetime?  Why during this generation?&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>We have to realize, of course, that, first of all, God does
not owe any person anything.  We are not owed anything in this world by God. 
However, God does give us wonderful blessings.  Whether we are saved or
unsaved, He sends the rain on both.  People enjoy the good things of this life,
whether they are saved or unsaved.  Yet God is not obligated.  It is not His
duty to provide these things.  God is under no duty to grant a long and joyous
life, full of riches and comforts, to anyone.  God does not owe any man or
woman or child this kind of a life.  </p>

<p>As we look at the history of the world, we actually need to
keep in mind that there have been many people, untold millions or tens of
millions or more, who have lived on this earth.  Throughout the generations of
the history of this world, they have died at a young age for different
reasons.  In many cases, it was due to a disease of some sort, especially if a
plague overtook a city or a land.  Sometimes it was due to poverty and
starvation, which is still continuing today.  Or it could be due to war.  Man&rsquo;s
inhumanity to his fellowman still exists.  All sorts of people have had their
lives cut short for one of these reasons, as well as others.  </p>

<p>This being so, did God unfairly treat them?  We know that
all things are according to the will of God.  He is the One who allows certain
events to take place.  We know that He is the God who is in control of all
circumstances.  So were they shortchanged in any way because they died as a
child or because they died as a young man in battle?  Did God do wrong?  </p>

<p>Of course not!  No, God did not do wrong.  We could never
say that a person has been wronged by God, no matter what the circumstances. 
We have to keep in mind that God does not owe you or me or anybody else
anything.  We have to remember that we have all fallen into sin and that we
have all rebelled against God.  Therefore, is God obligated in any way to
ensure that each rebel lives a long and pleasurable and prosperous life, even
though they are in sin?  No!  Absolutely not!  </p>

<p>Just think of a kingdom wherein some of the subjects to the
king rebelled against the king and did not want to serve him or to obey him or
to do his bidding.  Instead, they violently rebel.  It would be ridiculous for
us to think that the king needs to keep them comfortable during their
rebellion.   Of course not!  This would not be reasonable.  There is not a king
on earth who would feel any obligation to such subjects who are so rebellious
against him.  </p>

<p>Once again, the Bible has always warned mankind that there would
come an end to this world.  Therefore, there must be an end-time generation, a
generation who never reach their completion, mothers whose children are never
able to grow up, teenagers who are never able to enter college, college
students who are never able to enter their desired profession, and elderly
people who are never able to enjoy their retirement.  </p>

<p>This is the way that it must be for the last generations of
man upon this earth, and it so happens that we are that last generation.  If we
read what the Bible says, we will see that we do qualify.  The Bible tells us
that before God destroyed the world of Noah&rsquo;s day, He took account and saw that
the thought of man&rsquo;s heart &ldquo;<b><i>was </i></b><b>only evil continually</b>.&rdquo; 
Also, before He destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord saw the wickedness of
those cities.  </p>

<p>What about our generation?  Can we say to God, &ldquo;Oh God, it
is not fair for You to destroy us.  Look at how faithful we are.  Look at how
we desire to obey You.  Look at how we lift up the Bible and want to do all
that is found therein.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No.  This certainly does not describe our generation.  In
our generation, there are nearly seven billion people upon this earth, all in
sin.  Much of the world is going their own way and desiring sinful and evil
things like never before in the history of the world.  We definitely qualify as
the end-time generation.  </p>

<p>Well, it is upon us.  The time is now.  There will be no
more generations of man.  Therefore, may each one of us look at our own lives. 
If we need to mourn for days that will never come for our families and our
children, then let us mourn and get it out of the way.  Go as Jephthah&rsquo;s
daughter went.  For a couple of months, she went up and down the mountain
bewailing her virginity because she heard the news that her father had to offer
her as a sacrifice.  Her life was coming to an end.  </p>

<p>We also can mourn because it is as though we have gone to
the doctor and the doctor has confirmed that, yes, we have but a short time to
live.  Therefore, may you and may I and may each one of us look at ourselves
and our lives and not continue to feel sorry for ourselves that we cannot
continue to live in this world.  Instead, may we go to God and beseech Him for
eternal life, for that life that goes on into eternity future without end and
is the greatest of all things imaginable.  May we go to the Lord that He might
have mercy upon us at this time.  </p>
