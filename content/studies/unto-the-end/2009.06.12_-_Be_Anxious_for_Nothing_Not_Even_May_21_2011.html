<p>Hello and welcome.  Have you heard about May 21<sup>st</sup>, 2011?  Have you taken this information seriously?  </p>

<p>You should because the information regarding the rapture,
which will occur on May 21 in 2011, is not coming from any kind of supernatural
source.  It is not based on a dream or a vision.  No one received a tongue or
had a dream or a nightmare where they saw May 21 circled in red on a calendar. 
</p>

<p>No, it is not based on any of that.  If it were, we could immediately
dismiss it.  We know that God has given us His Word, the Bible.  When He
finished writing the Book, we read in the last book, the book of Revelation, in
the last chapter, where He told us, &ldquo;Do not add or subtract from this Word.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So this is it.  This is the complete Word of God.  And the
information about May 21<sup>st</sup> is not coming from anywhere outside of
the Bible.  It is coming directly from the Bible.  </p>

<p>This means that people who profess to be Christians ought to
give this a fair hearing.  They should, according to the Scriptures themselves,
be like the Bereans, whom the Lord identified as being noble, and check the
Scriptures to see if it is so.  </p>

<p>But many are not honestly receiving this information and
checking it out in the Bible.  They are, right off the bat, turning away from
it, ignoring it, avoiding it; and that, we could say, God&rsquo;s people would not do
because the source is correct.  It is the Bible and only the Bible.  It is the
Word of God; therefore, it should be examined and it should be evaluated for
trustworthiness.  </p>

<p>If anyone does do so, they would find much Biblical
evidence, conclusive Biblical evidence, that May 21 in 2011 will be the date of
the rapture and it will be followed by five months of torment for all those
left behind.  Then finally on October 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011, it will be the
end of the world and the end of all of the unsaved who are left behind.  </p>

<p>If you have been hearing this information, there might be an
interest in you, and there should be.  For the sake of self-preservation, an
individual really should have an interest in finding out more and finding out
if there is any way of escaping this awful judgment that is coming upon the
world.  </p>

<p>So I am sure, because the Lord is saving a great multitude
of people during these last days of the Great Tribulation up until May 21<sup>st</sup>,
that there are many in the drawing process where the Lord is dealing with many
people.  There could be many also who are feeling very uneasy, very troubled in
their minds, disturbed about how they have lived their lives and the things
that they have done.  </p>

<p>This is not a bad reaction.  This is a right reaction.  It
would remind us of the Ninevites.  When they heard the news that they only had
forty days, they did not continue on with business as normal.  They responded
by crying out to the Lord.  The life of their city was interrupted for a period
of time and the Lord spared them and delivered them.  So, too, He could deliver
others in our day, and He will save a great many.  </p>

<p>Well, if you are in this situation, what are you to do?  The
Bible gives us a principle, a principle that will apply from now until the end
of the world.  This principle can be seen in the book of Philippians.  In Philippians
4:6-7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Be careful for nothing&hellip;  </p>

<p>And the word &ldquo;careful&rdquo; is an Old English word that means &ldquo;anxious.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p class="verse">Be [anxious] for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And
the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and
minds through Christ Jesus.  </p>

<p>Yes, even the end of the world, &ldquo;<b>Be anxious for nothing</b>.&rdquo; 
We are fast approaching this date.  The time we have left will quickly fly by
and it would be very easy to get nervous and fearful and supremely anxious
about this approaching date for the end.  But the Lord gives us information
here that comes from the mouth of wisdom, from His mouth Himself.  </p>

<p>Instead of biting our nails and trembling&mdash;because, yes, we
will tremble&mdash;we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.  But how do
we work it out?  This is part of working it out.  We go to God.  We go to the
Lord &ldquo;<b>in every thing by prayer</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So if we find ourselves maybe down and so troubled in mind,
we can go to God and pray, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord, have mercy on me.  I beseech You to
save me.  Please, bless Your Word that I am hearing to my heart and make me one
of Thine elect.  Grant me repentance unto life.  Grant me Your mercy and Your
grace that I do not deserve and could never earn.  Only for Christ&rsquo;s sake, may
You have mercy on me.  And when You come, may I enter in, like the five wise
virgins, and may I ascend up into Heaven and not be left behind.  O Father, I
fear this.  I worry about this.  I am anxious that I might be left behind. 
Will You not, O Lord, grant me peace, peace with You that only comes through
salvation and Christ, peace of mind, peace that cannot be taken away, peace
that passes all understanding?  Please, grant me this peace in my soul.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Do you see how we can pray to God?  Do you see how we can
cry out to Him in our anxiety, in our anxious fears?  We can cast our care upon
Him and pray that He might care for us.  Maybe the next day, once again, we are
feeling anxious and worried and careful, so we can do this again and again.  </p>

<p>Actually, would this not be a good way of spending our time,
of leading into this coming day of the Lord&rsquo;s wrath?  We can just continue
beseeching the Lord and crying out, &ldquo;O Lord, even though You slay me, I will
trust in You.  Where can I go, for &lsquo;<b>Thou hast the words of eternal life</b>&rsquo;? 
I cannot and I will not run to any other source.  Only You, O Lord, are the
Rock.  May I be found standing upon You and not upon a house of sand.&rdquo;  </p>
