<p>Hello and welcome.  Please allow me to ask you a question. 
What are your priorities in life?  </p>

<p>Someone might say, &ldquo;Well, first of all, education; I need to
get a diploma, a Master&rsquo;s degree or a Doctorate.  That will set me up for a
good career,&rdquo; which is another top priority in many people&rsquo;s lives: a
good-paying job, a job that is worthwhile.  Thirdly, someone might say that a
top priority is having a family, finding a good wife or a good husband and
raising children in a nice home.  </p>

<p>These are the priorities of many people.  Many people are
striving and seeking to obtain these things.  Of course, people seek many other
things along with these because God has given us a world that is very enjoyable
and full of things that we can do that are pleasurable.  We can really enjoy
life as we live in this world.  </p>

<p>Well, also on many people&rsquo;s list is a right relationship
with God.  It is somewhere down on their list.  It is not near the top, but it
is on their list.  </p>

<p>God, actually, would rearrange our priorities, and this has
always been true.   It has always been a fact that God should not be number
five or number seven or number ten on our list of what we should be seeking
after in this life.  No, God would always have Himself as Number One. </p>

<p>Actually, considering the day that we are living in, as we
have learned from the Bible that May 21 in the year 2011 will be Judgment Day,
our priorities ought to be revisited.  Each one of us should look at what we
are doing with our lives.  What are we desiring?  What are we seeking after?  What
has Number One priority, as we go day-by-day?  </p>

<p>The Lord tells us in Matthew 6:31-33:</p>

<p class="verse">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these
things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you.  </p>

<p>This is the rearrangement of man&rsquo;s priorities by God
Himself.  </p>

<p>You know, the Lord is really helping us.  Here is the direction
for your life and for my life and for everyone&rsquo;s life, if we would but listen
to God&rsquo;s Word.  &ldquo;<b>Seek ye first</b>,&rdquo; not money, not food, not clothing, not
these things that are all around us in the world.  It is true that individuals who
have no concern for a right relationship with God seek these things at the top
of their lists.  But God says, &ldquo;Number One, seek the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is what is of the greatest importance and what ought to
be sought first: God&rsquo;s Kingdom, which is incredibly glorious and weighty and a
tremendously everlasting great mercy of God that anyone would be able to enter
His Kingdom. Seek this first because this lasts forever.  Because it is
eternal, this greatly supersedes any earthly joys or pleasures or involvements,
or anything else that this world can offer.  </p>

<p>You can pile up the greatest life imaginable.  You can be
the richest man and the most respected man and have all the things that you
desire; yet in comparison to a place in the Kingdom of God in God&rsquo;s Heaven for
all eternity, anything that you would be able to obtain in this life would only
last but a moment compared to the vastness of eternity future.  All of life is
only but a drop of water that quickly evaporates, in comparison to the eternal
life that awaits the child of God, with God dwelling in their very presence
forevermore.  </p>

<p>Therefore, it is obvious that God&rsquo;s Kingdom is so valuable that
it should be desired and sought first; not second, not any other spot, but
first.  We should get up in the morning going to prayer.  We should get up in
the morning reading the Bible.  We should begin each day first by going to
God.  In the back of our minds, as we are doing the necessary things of this
life, our desire really should be, &ldquo;Oh, I cannot wait to go to lunch in order
to spend some time with God&rsquo;s Word,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I cannot wait to get home, after all
my responsibilities are taken care of, so that I can pray to the Lord that He
might have mercy and help me and strengthen me to live and to do His will.&rdquo;    You
see, God&rsquo;s Kingdom is of the utmost importance.  Nothing can compare to it.  </p>

<p>Likewise, the Lord says, &ldquo;<b>Seek ye first the </b><b>kingdom</b><b>
 of </b><b>God</b><b>, <span class="underline">and</span> his righteousness</b>.&rdquo;  God tells us to seek
His righteousness because it is impossible that any of our righteousness can grant
us entry into the Kingdom of God.  It is only through what the Lord Jesus Christ
has done and His great work of faith that anyone can enter into Heaven and obtain
eternal life.  They really go hand-in-hand.  You cannot seek the Kingdom of God
any other way except through Christ and His righteousness.  It is only through
His righteousness that we would be permitted to enter into the gates of Heaven.  </p>

<p>How do we seek Christ&rsquo;s righteousness?  We go to God and we
confess, &ldquo;Oh Lord, I am a sinner and all my righteousness, that is all of my good
works or deeds or anything that I have done that even remotely seems like it
was a good thing, is nothing in your sight but like filthy rags.  Oh Lord, have
mercy on me.  Grant me the covering of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, that pure white
garment, the fine linen of the saints.  Wash me from my sins that I might be
clean and righteous only for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;   This is the way to go to God.  </p>

<p>Now, we do not know what God is going to do.  If we go to Him
pleading, it could be just as the Ninevites hoped.  As we cry mightily to God,
the Lord might turn from His anger.  This was the case with the Ninevites.  God
did turn and save many in that city.  </p>

<p>May He have mercy upon you and upon His people.  For this
day and for the few days that we have left, may we seek first that Kingdom of God
and His righteousness.   </p>
