<p>Hello and welcome.  Let me ask you a question.  Are you
saved?  Before you answer, please think about this.  Think about this because
the Bible encourages each person: &ldquo;<b>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the
faith</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why does the Bible encourage us to do this?  Is salvation
not a simple matter?  Is it not to simply hear the Gospel, recognize that you
are a sinner, admit this, say the sinner&rsquo;s prayer, and then confess Christ?  Is
it not as easy as one-two-three to just accept Him and believe on the Lord?  </p>

<p>Well, this is the easy methodology that the churches and
congregations present today, many of them; I will not say all.  But, actually,
this is not the methodology of the Bible.  </p>

<p>Many think that they are saved because they took a step of
faith.  They reached out and think that they brought the Lord Jesus to them
through some work that they did.  They would not call this a work, but it is.  They
pray.  They say the sinner&rsquo;s prayer.  They come down the aisle or just accept Christ
and then they think that it was a choice of their will.  </p>

<p>This is where the idea of &ldquo;free will&rdquo; comes from.  Theologians
encourage people, &ldquo;Well, you have a &lsquo;free will&rsquo; and you can exercise it any way
that you want.  You can reject Christ or you can accept Christ.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But this is not true when it comes to salvation.  We cannot
accept the Lord Jesus into our hearts and become saved because God tells us,
matter-of-factly&mdash;and this is about as definitive as anything could be in the
Bible&mdash;that we are not born by &ldquo;<b>the will of man, but of God</b>.&rdquo;  You can
read this in John 1:12-13.  We are born from above, as we read in John 3.  We
are born by the action of God.  It is He who must save us &ldquo;<b>and not we
ourselves</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Maybe this does not make any sense to you because then what
is the &ldquo;Gospel call?&rdquo;  God says, &ldquo;<b>Believe on the Lord Jesus </b><b>Chris</b><b>t,
and thou shalt be saved</b>;&rdquo; but the Bible also tells us that none can believe
to the degree that the Word of God demands, which is total belief &ldquo;<b>with all
thy heart and with all thy soul</b>.&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>There is none that seeketh after God</b>,&rdquo;

the Bible tells us in Romans 3:10-12, because we cannot seek God sufficiently
according to the Word of God.  </p>

<p>All of these commands are designed to show us that we fall
short.  We &ldquo;<b>come short of the glory of God</b>.&rdquo;  We just cannot get
ourselves into Heaven.  If we think that we do the least bit of work, then we
have corrupted the Gospel of grace.  We have perverted the Gospel of grace and
we have developed &ldquo;<b>another gospel</b>&rdquo; wherein there is no salvation.  </p>

<p>There is no question about this.  If you think that you have
done something, anything involved with salvation&mdash;that you took some kind of
action&mdash;then you do not have the salvation of the Bible and you are in a
dangerous position because you still do not have the salvation that the Bible
shows us.  </p>

<p>So what kind of salvation is that?  What can we do then?  </p>

<p>Well, God has given us a great privilege.  He is merciful
beyond anything that we can comprehend.  He is gracious to thousands.  He is
kind and good and a wonderful Saviour.  The Bible, again and again, tries to
show us the great love of God towards sinners and towards His elect people and God
encourages us to go to Him, not demandingly, not arrogantly and trying to force
Him to save us; no, but humbly and lowly, mindful of our situation, which is
that we are rebels and transgressors of the Law of God, guilty of breaking the
Law.  </p>

<p>We are guilty and deserving of the penalty of the Law, which
is an eternal death, an &ldquo;<b>everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord</b>,&rdquo; an end to existence.  This is what we deserve.  None of us deserves
God&rsquo;s grace or mercy.  He gives this to the undeserving.  </p>

<p>We are like a guilty criminal who is awaiting the death
penalty.  He has already been tried.  He is already subject to the death
penalty.  It is just a matter of when.  He is on death row.  Yet God permits us
to contact Him in order to beseech Him for pardon, that we might be spared and
delivered and saved.  </p>

<p>What a merciful God that He allows the worst offenders to
enter a plea for pardon!  And God gives us many examples of this.  One place in
the Bible where we see a right approach to the Lord in the matter of salvation
is in Psalm 123.  It says in Psalm 123:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
heavens.  Behold, as the eyes of servants <i>look </i>unto the hand of their
masters, <i>and </i>as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
our eyes <i>wait </i>upon JEHOVAH our God, until that he have mercy upon us.  Have
mercy upon us, O JEHOVAH, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled
with contempt.  Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
are at ease, <i>and </i>with the contempt of the proud.  </p>

<p>You see, here there is a cry for mercy and there is then
waiting.  This is what God permits us to do.  This is the Gospel of the Bible. 
</p>

<p>Yes, read the Scriptures.  Read the Word of God as much as
you can.  And while you are reading or after you read, stop and pray, &ldquo;O Lord,
O Father, have mercy on me!  Have mercy!  I am guilty and yet I have heard that
You are merciful and that Your mercy is everlasting.  Even though I know that
You will have mercy upon whom You will have mercy, I beseech You.  O Lord,
there is no reason, there is not good reason at all, no reason whatsoever why
You should save me.  I am as guilty as everyone and more so, and yet only
because You are merciful, only because You have provided a way of salvation
through the Lord Jesus, do I beseech You.  I look only to You.  I look nowhere
else.  There is no other gospel.  I will not bring salvation to myself because
that is deceitful.  I will perish if I do so.  So Lord I do wait, but time is
getting short.  O Father, have mercy!  Could it be that You will save me?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we wait.  We wait.  Today and tomorrow, if we find
ourselves still troubled and still not sure&mdash;we still wonder because we see our
sin&mdash;then we cry again and we beseech the Lord again and we wait.  We wait upon
the Lord, for it is in His hands.  </p>

<p>Could there be any better place for the whole matter to rest
than in the hands of such a gracious and merciful God?  </p>
