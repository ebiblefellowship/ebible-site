<p>Hello and welcome.  Please allow me to ask you a question. 
Will May 21, 2011 really be Judgment Day?  Are we really at the end of the
world?  </p>

<p>The answer is, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  May 21 in the year 2011 is it.  This
is all the time that God has allotted for salvation in this world.  There will
be five months additional time in the world, but it will be five months of
torment.  This torment will primarily be due to the fact that there will no
longer be any salvation possible for the inhabitants of the earth.  Therefore, May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day.  It is really, for all intents and purposes, the day of the
end, even though it will not be until five months later&mdash;on October 21 in
2011&mdash;when God actually destroys the earth and the universe and this whole
creation.  </p>

<p>God is not doing this out of the blue.  In the Bible, God
has often told mankind of His plain intention to destroy this universe.  Why is
God going to destroy it?  Because God created man good but man has brought the
judgment of God down upon himself with his sin, in his sinful rebellion against
his Creator.  </p>

<p>We read of God&rsquo;s intention to destroy this present world in
2 Peter 3:10 where it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
shall be burned up.  </p>

<p>This is also stated very clearly in 1 John 2.  God tells us
in 1 John 2:15-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Love not the world, neither the things <i>that are </i>in the
world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all
that <i>is </i>in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes,
and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world
passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth
for ever.</p>

<p>It is out of concern that God commands us to not love this
world.  We are not to get too attached because it is only here temporarily.  </p>

<p>How much more true is this today?  Our time left is
extremely short.  The time that we have left from now until the end of the
world is coming very quickly.  Like sand dropping out of an hourglass, the time
is almost gone.  </p>

<p>It is obvious that God will one day destroy the world.  I
say this because the Bible states this matter-of-factly for individuals who
believe the Bible, and it is God&rsquo;s people who believe the Bible.  For the ones
whom He has given faith and salvation and an understanding of His Word, they
absolutely believe that the Bible is the Word of God.  Therefore, of course,
God intends to destroy the world because this is throughout the Bible in
various places.  </p>

<p>Since this is the case, the question that must be asked at
this point is, &ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo;  Why not now?  Are we not ripe for judgment; that
is, this world that we live in and the church world also?  </p>

<p>As we see the churches and congregations everywhere in the
world fall away from the truth of the Bible, we really have to ask ourself the
question, &ldquo;Has not the sin of this world far surpassed the wickedness of any
past generations?  Can we look back in secular or church history to find a more
wicked people?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Some people like to point to the Roman Empire and say, &ldquo;Well,
they were immoral.&rdquo;  A lot of bad things are said about the Roman Empire; but,
actually, we find in the pages of the Bible that when the Romans were in view,
they had a very high regard for the law.  </p>

<p>So I do not think that this is arguable.  I think that this
is very obvious to all of us today.  We know that we are in uncharted waters. 
As far as it comes to wickedness, we are extremely more evil than any people
who have ever lived upon the earth.  The hearts of men have grown cold in this
day like never before.  The world is most definitely ripe for judgment.  </p>

<p>Likewise, the churches and congregations of the world have
fallen away from truth.  They disregard what the Bible teaches on point after
point after point.  They go their own way.  They teach their own doctrines. 
They develop their own music.  They even develop their own translations of the
Bible, a watered-down gospel, watered-down translations, worldly music, and
doctrinal teaching after doctrinal teaching in error and in opposition to what
the Bible says.  There has never been a time in history like now when, really,
the whole world with one voice is crying out to God for judgment.  </p>

<p>When we share that the Bible teaches that the end of the
world is coming in 2011, that Judgment Day is May 21, it is very significant
that people do not say&mdash;at least I have not run into anyone who has said
this&mdash;they do not say, &ldquo;Well, God cannot judge the world.  Look at how much
progress we are making as a human race.  Look at how we are progressing in love
and care.  Our society is at least making some progress in goodness.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Absolutely no one thinks this or says this.  They might say,
&ldquo;Oh, you cannot know.&rdquo;  People in the churches very significantly say, &ldquo;No man
knows the day or hour; this is why it is not going to happen.&rdquo;  However, they
do not say, &ldquo;Look at the churches.  Look at how faithful the congregations
are.  Look at how they so desire to obey God and His Word.  Look at their
diligence as they study, study, study to correct their doctrine.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No one says this.  Absolutely no one!  It is very obvious
for those who have eyes to see that the church of our day is exceedingly sinful
and has fallen away.  </p>

<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:3, God tells us that the Day of Christ
will not come:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;except there come a falling away first&hellip;  </p>

<p>Will May 21, 2011 really be Judgment Day?  </p>

<p>If we look at the world of our day and if we look at the
church world of our day, we can certainly see how it is most appropriate.  If God
brings judgment on that day&mdash;and He will&mdash;then nobody can say that it was
unfair.  No one can say that they should not have experienced the judgment of
God.  </p>
