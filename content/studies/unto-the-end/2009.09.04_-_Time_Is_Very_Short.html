<p>Hello and welcome.  Time is flying!  This is an expression that
we often find people using in this world.  It is true that people who are
living their lives in this world apart from God and apart from serving Him also
notice that time quickly passes by.  They spend the days of their lives
involved with education, in an occupation, in family life, in marriage, and in
raising children, as the world also notices this passage of time.    </p>

<p>I remember a couple of songs from about 20 or 30 years ago
that really related to the quick passing of time.  It is very interesting to
see how the world views this passing of time.  One was called &ldquo;Time Passages.&rdquo; 
Another song had as part of its lyrics, &ldquo;<i>Time keeps on slippin, slippin,
slippin&hellip;into the future</i>,&rdquo; which is a true statement.  </p>

<p>No one can stop time; however, there was an occasion in the
Bible when the sun stood still as the Lord fought for Israel.  But, really,
time continues on an onward march, going on until that appointed day, and we
have learned that this &ldquo;<b>appointed time</b>&rdquo; will be May 21, 2011, which will begin the &ldquo;<b>day of the Lord</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>By the way, time will still continue after May 21 for a
period of five months, which will be one hundred and fifty-three days of our
calendar.  Then finally on October 21, God will destroy this world and
universe.  The whole creation will be destroyed and then recreated into &ldquo;<b>the
new heavens and the new earth</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We have from now until then just a short space of time.  It is
a fact that time keeps on &ldquo;<i>slippin&hellip;into the future</i>.&rdquo;  Our time to bring
the Gospel, if we are true believers, has grown incredibly short; and our time
to hear the gospel, if we are not yet a child of God, has also grown incredibly
short.  Time is flying and this is normally the case, as the Lord wrote in Job
14:1: </p>

<p class="verse">Man <i>that is </i>born of a woman <i>is </i>of few days, and
full of trouble.  </p>

<p>This is a good summary of life as normal in this world; because
even if we were to live the expected lifespan of 70 or 80 years, as established
by God in Psalm 90, and even if we were to live a full and long life, the day
would eventually come for each one of us when God would come and take away our
spirit in death.  We would be at the same point that we are now, because each
one of us has now been given this notice from the Bible.   </p>

<p>This is very similar to an individual who goes to the doctor
and discovers that he has cancer.  The doctor informs him, &ldquo;You have a very
short time to live.&rdquo;  So what does this individual do?  </p>

<p>After the original shock wears off, it takes him maybe a few
days to assimilate this knowledge.  Then he would look at his life and he would
realize how vain and how lacking in meaning his life had really been.  Over the
short space of time that he had left, he would try to live his life in a more
honorable way.  </p>

<p>This is how the people of the world react to such news. 
However, the child of God must also take into account his life and look at his
days.  </p>

<p>Have you ever done this?  Have you ever looked over the
course of your life and reviewed how you have lived up to this point?  </p>

<p>With many of us&mdash;and I am afraid that this is true with me,
too&mdash;it is not a very pretty sight as we look back on the days of the years of
our lives and we see just how much time and how much of our lives we have
wasted and let go by.  </p>

<p>The child of God who has been given &ldquo;<b>a new heart and a
new spirit</b>&rdquo; desires to do it God&rsquo;s way and to serve God.  This is why we
find it very hard to see any worthwhile endeavors that we were involved with in
times past before we were a believer.  </p>

<p>Now, however, we have an incredibly worthwhile endeavor to
occupy our time with until this &ldquo;<b>great day</b>&rdquo; arrives.  What is this
incredibly worthwhile endeavor that we can be busy occupying our time with?  It
is sharing the Word of God.  It is warning people as &ldquo;<b>a watchman</b>&rdquo; that
time is short, as God commands us to do.  </p>

<p>You are not going to see your retirement and live a life of
ease in Florida or California or in some other vacation spot.  No, you are
never going to get there, because time is too short.  Instead, this is the time
to warn the people that the sword is approaching, as God commands us in Ezekiel
33.  In Ezekiel 33:3-7, it says:</p>

<p class="verse">If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
trumpet, and warn the people; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet,
and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall
be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning;
his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the
people be not warned; if the sword come, and take <i>any </i>person from among
them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the
watchman&rsquo;s hand. So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them
from me.  </p>

<p>This is our task.  Our overwhelming desire is to share this
information that is coming from God, because it is coming from the Bible and no
other source.  God commands us to &ldquo;<b>warn them from me</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>May the Lord work in us &ldquo;<b>both to will and to do of <i>his

</i>good pleasure</b>&rdquo; to perform that which He would have us do today.  With
the few days that we have remaining, may we utilize each day to the utmost of
our abilities to serve God in sharing this information that &ldquo;<b>the end of all
things is at hand</b>&rdquo; and that time is very, very short.   </p>
