<p>Hello and welcome.  May I ask you an extremely important
question?  Have you begged God for mercy as yet?  </p>

<p>You might wonder why you should beg God for mercy.  The
answer is that the Bible teaches us that every human being, every person, is a
sinner.  Because of our sin, we are under God&rsquo;s wrath and subject to eternal
destruction.  We will die, &ldquo;<b>For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death</b>,&rdquo; and time
for reconciliation with God has grown extremely short; we have very little time
left.  </p>

<p>Some people might answer and say, &ldquo;Yes, I have prayed.  I
have gone to God and I have even asked Him to have mercy on me and to save me. 
I pray this fairly often.  I say &lsquo;O Lord, have mercy.  Amen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, this is a correct idea to have and the words are even
correct, but someone who is going to God and even daily bringing such a
statement to the Lord, &ldquo;Have mercy,&rdquo; and quickly closing their prayer with, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;

is likely an individual who has a lackadaisical attitude towards approaching
the Lord for mercy.  In other words, such a casual prayer to God for mercy may
be an indicator that this person has not seen as yet the tremendous danger that
they are in.  </p>

<p>Let me give you an example.  You have just fallen off of a
cruise ship in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  It is at night and extremely
dark.  The ship is continuing on without you.  The personnel of the ship are
unaware that you have fallen into the water. </p>

<p>How long do you think it would take you to recognize the
great danger that you are in, being in the middle of the water, at night, with
no boat, no life preserver, and no one even knowing that you are there?  Would
you not cry out desperately, &ldquo;Help!  Help me!&rdquo;?  And would you not repeatedly do
this until you could cry no more?  Even if the ship had continued into the
night and you could no longer see the ship, you would still cry for assistance,
for help, because you would know that your life was in danger.  </p>

<p>Well, the Lord is giving us information at this time from
the Bible that is letting each one of us know that our lives are in danger,
that we have a short while until May 21 in 2011.  As a result, if we understand
this, if we truly see this from the Bible, we will be looking at our life and
examining ourselves to see whether or not we are really a true child of God. 
If we are doing this, then we are a person who recognizes this great spiritual
danger as well as the great physical danger; because on that day, God is going
to bring judgment on the world for five months.  After this five-month period,
He will utterly destroy this world and this universe and all of unsaved
mankind.  </p>

<p>Knowing this, why would you not go to God for mercy and say
more than, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy; amen,&rdquo; and then just go about your daily
business?  </p>

<p>Think of the Ninevites in the book of Jonah.  Jonah entered
into the city and proclaimed, &ldquo;<b>Yet forty days, and </b><b>Nineveh</b><b>
shall be overthrown</b>.&rdquo;  After the people had heard that they had only forty
days before Nineveh was to be destroyed and this word had come unto the king,
we read in Jonah 3:6-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him </i>with sackcloth,
and sat in ashes. And he caused <i>it </i>to be proclaimed and published
through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither
man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink
water: But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto
God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that
<i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn and repent, and
turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>

<p>You see, we find here that the information that Jonah
brought to the city contained two elements.  Jonah spoke one sentence that we
have recorded:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>Within this sentence, there was time: forty days; and
judgment: at the end of forty days, God&rsquo;s wrath would fall.  And the Ninevites
were brought to the point of action, from the king on down.  </p>

<p>What action were they brought to?  They turned from their
sin and beseeched God and cried mightily unto Him.  </p>

<p>So you see, this is the point of our question today.  Have <span class="underline">you</span>

begged God for mercy?  </p>

<p>You know, there is begging and then there is BEGGING!  We
can see the difference when someone says, &ldquo;Friend, do you have a quarter to
spare?,&rdquo; and you either give it to them or you go on.  But then, someone comes up
to you and says, &ldquo;Oh please, sir, please.  I desperately need a quarter.  Will
you not give me a quarter?,&rdquo; and they continue asking and begging.  Maybe they
even fall down in front of you because they need this money so badly.  Now,
that is BEGGING!  </p>

<p>God gives us many examples of this in the Bible.  Another
one is found in the account of a beggar, a blind man by the name of Bartimaeus,
the son of Timaeus.  We find this in Mark 10:46-47:</p>

<p class="verse">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus,
sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, <i>thou </i>son of David, have mercy on
me.</p>

<p>Here is an example of beseeching God; but this man had lived
his life as a beggar asking people for money, and so this was nothing that was
really different or new to him.  Some people would give him money and some
would not.  He was blind. There was nothing else he could do in that day but
beg.  Yet as he begged, we find in Mark 10:48, after crying to the Lord for
mercy:  </p>

<p class="verse">And many charged him that he should hold his peace&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is, they were telling him to be quiet, to not cry out
so.  But it goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but he cried the more a great deal, <i>Thou </i>son of David,
have mercy on me.  </p>

<p>You see, God is letting us know, in no uncertain terms, that
the end is here, the end of the world, the end of your life and of man&rsquo;s life
in this world, and that there is the possibility of forgiveness with God; there
is the potential of having all sins forgiven and of living with Him in Heaven,
in &ldquo;<b>the new heavens and the new earth</b>,&rdquo; forevermore; there is eternal
life to those whom God saves.  </p>

<p>Since we are in such danger and since our lives will surely come
to an end if we do not find salvation, then will you not go to God and beg Him
and beg Him, as though you really understand and as though you really see these
things and as though you really believe these things?  </p>

<p>Yes, we can do this.  We can go to God and we can say, &ldquo;<b>Lord,
I believe; help thou mine unbelief</b>,&rdquo; but we need to go beseeching Him, &ldquo;<b><i>Thou</i>
Son of David</b>,&rdquo; because He is the Messiah, He is the anointed one, the Christ. 
So we beseech Him, &ldquo;<b><i>Thou</i> </b><b>son of David, have mercy on me</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>May each one of us cry mightily to God, but let us not do
this to make a show for others.  Let us do this in private, in our &ldquo;closet.&rdquo; 
Let us go to the Lord and cry, &ldquo;Please save me.  I know that there is no reason
that You should.  There is definitely nothing that I have ever done that should
cause You to bring grace and mercy to me.  All of my actions have only brought
about my condemnation and show my guilt.  Forgive for Christ&rsquo;s sake, Thou Son
of David.  Lord, You came to save; have mercy.&rdquo;  </p>
