<p>Hello and welcome.  Today I would like to ask you a
question.  Have you heard the warning about May 21, 2011 as being the date of the Rapture?  If you have, then the question that I would like to ask you is
whether or not you have taken action.  Have you taken action as yet?  </p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?,&rdquo; someone might ask.  &ldquo;What action do I
have to take?  I am hearing it.  I am listening to it.  Maybe I am even in
agreement with this information.  So what action do I have to take?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well this is good.  It is good that you are hearing this. 
It is good that you are open-minded.  It is good that you are continuing to
listen.  However, this information requires action.  God requires a response
from you and from each person who hears this.  </p>

<p>One type of response can be seen as we think about Jonah. 
Jonah was a prophet who lived in the Old Testament days whom the Lord sent to
the city of Nineveh.  The Lord gave Jonah information to share with the
Ninevites that was pretty short.  It was just one sentence.  He said, &ldquo;<b>Yet
forty days, and </b><b>Nineveh</b><b> shall be overthrown [<i>overturned</i>]</b>.&rdquo; 

</p>

<p>This is all that we read that Jonah said as he entered into
the city of Nineveh, which was a message that contained two elements: &ldquo;<b>time
and judgment</b>&rdquo;; time (forty days) and judgment (because after forty days,
they would be overturned).  </p>

<p>Likewise, we have been given a message from God.  No, not as
Jonah was given, because God gave Jonah direct revelation.  Jonah received Divine
revelation that was given in a supernatural way where the Lord communicated directly
with him.  However, we were not spoken to from Heaven.  God did not give us a
dream or a vision.  It is nothing like that, but He has spoken to us.  It is
Divine revelation, because it comes to us from His Word, the Bible.  What we
read in the Bible is as true as what God spoke directly to individuals, because
it is the same Word.  It is His Word.  </p>

<p>So God spoke to Jonah and Jonah shared that word with the
Ninevites.  The Ninevites correctly recognized that this was not something coming
from Jonah, but from God.  We know this because Jonah 3:5 tells us, &ldquo;<b>So the
people of </b><b>Nineveh</b><b> believed God</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Likewise, today, we are hearing from the Bible, which is
Divine revelation.  It is from the mouth of God that May 21, 2011 will be the time of Christ&rsquo;s return for His people.  This will be the day of the Rapture
when His people will be taken up out of this world.  This is also the &ldquo;<b>day
of judgment</b>&rdquo; for the rest of the world, which will be the vast majority of
mankind who will be left behind.  </p>

<p>Therefore, when we are hearing about May 21, 2011, we are hearing a very similar message that the Ninevites heard: &ldquo;<b>time and judgment</b>.&rdquo; 
That is, there is only so much time left between now and then, and then on that
day will be the judgment.  </p>

<p>What was the reaction of the Ninevites?  Well, it was a
wonderful reaction as God moved in that city greatly.  From the king on down,
they sat in sackcloth and ashes and fasted and cried &ldquo;<b>mightily unto God</b>.&rdquo; 
Because they knew that He was a merciful God, they said, &ldquo;<b>Who can tell <i>if

</i>God will turn&hellip;from his fierce anger</b>?&rdquo;  And, actually, God did turn and
He did not destroy that city.  </p>

<p>Now, there is absolutely no possibility that God will turn
from the judgment of May 21<sup>st</sup>.  This is going to happen, and yet God
gives us the example of the Ninevites who heard the warning.  They heard the
warning and took action.  </p>

<p>Now, their action did not save them.  No, there is no action
that any man can take that will save them, but there is a correct way and an
incorrect way of responding to information from God when He warns about an
approaching judgment.  </p>

<p>Another place in the Bible that shows us a correct and
obedient response is in Hebrews 11, which is the chapter of faith.  In one
verse, God sums up the days of Noah before the flood, as He had come to Noah
and had given him Divine revelation that He was going to destroy the world, the
whole earth, by the flood, a great deluge of water.  It says in Hebrew 11:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house&hellip;  </p>

<p>You see, here again, prior to the judgment, God gave warning
to Noah.  Did Noah just agree with it?  Did he say, &ldquo;Okay.  Okay, Lord.  I hear
what You are saying.  I understand that You are going to destroy the world,&rdquo; and
then go about his daily life just like before, in taking care of his
responsibilities, in doing his work, in being a good husband and father and
neighbor?  Was that Noah&rsquo;s response?  No.  No.  He was &ldquo;<b>moved with fear</b>&rdquo;
to the preparing of an ark.  </p>

<p>This ark was a great testimony to the world of his day.  It
was a witness.  It was, in a very real way, bringing the Gospel to all those
people to where they could be warned.  You see, this was Noah&rsquo;s response as God
moved in him &ldquo;<b>to will and to do of <i>his </i>good pleasure</b>,&rdquo; and Noah
took action.  </p>

<p>Now, the question for you and for me, as we are hearing this
repeatedly&mdash;and I do not think that we can hear this enough, but we are hearing
more and more that May 21, 2011  is the Rapture&mdash;is have you taken action?  We
have some space, not very much, but some time.  It is very little, but there is
still some time left between now until then.  Have you taken action?  Have you
responded to the Word of God?  </p>

<p>If so, have you been &ldquo;<b>moved with fear</b>&rdquo; to obey God,
to pray to Him, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord!  I have wasted much of my days.  When I look
at my life, I have wasted years and years of time, and now time is so short and
precious.  May You please use me?  May You please allow me the great privilege
of following You, of doing Your will, of giving up my life to serve You in
whatever way I might, in whatever way I can?  In whatever little way that I
can, please, O Lord, permit me to be &lsquo;<b>moved with fear</b>&rsquo; to do Your will.&rdquo;
