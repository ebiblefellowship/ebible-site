<p>Hello and welcome.  Please allow me to ask a question.  Are
you discouraged about prayer; that is, prayer for salvation?  The Bible instructs
us to go to God beseeching Him for mercy.  Have you done this?  Some people
think that they have; and they have, to some degree.  That is, they have gone
to God in prayer and they have asked Him for mercy.  </p>

<p>Actually, I have a friend who knew that he was not saved.  Many
times he would call me and discuss his problems regarding prayer, especially
concerning begging God for salvation.  He felt that his heart was not in it and
it was not long before he grew tired of asking God for mercy.  I wonder how
common a problem this is.   </p>

<p>One of the reasons why someone might get discouraged about
prayer and beseeching the Lord for salvation is that some people may have a completely
wrong idea when it comes to crying out to God for mercy.  They may not
understand what the Bible intends by this.</p>

<p>Why is it that God permits us this great privilege of
approaching Him in prayer and asking Him, crying, and beseeching that He might
save us?  Why is it that God gives us this great privilege?  </p>

<p>I hope that no one thinks that this is a formula of some
kind to become saved.  Many churches today, if not all, have developed a
formula for salvation.  Sometimes their formula differs from one to another;
but still, if you go into any church, they will tell you how you can get saved
or greatly imply it, &ldquo;Here is what you have to do.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>In our day especially, we know that this involves accepting Christ
and taking Him to yourself as Saviour, which is an impossibility.  No one can
bring salvation to themselves.  There is no formula.  The Bible will not allow
it.  It is not possible for man to take steps one, two and three, and then have
assurance of salvation.  </p>

<p>No, actually any steps that are taken&mdash;any formula which
outlines work toward salvation&mdash;is indicative that a person has not become saved,
because no work can justify us, neither can crying for mercy; beseeching God
for mercy cannot get us saved.  </p>

<p>There is no way that anyone can bring salvation to
themselves.  This is why the Ninevites were used of God as an example.  Yes, they
cried mightily to God for mercy.  But they also said, &ldquo;<b>Who can tell <i>if </i>God
will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger</b>?&rdquo;; if God will
save us, in other words. </p>

<p>You see, they knew that they could cry to God because He is
a merciful God and He does hear the prayer of some, according to His own
purposes.  Those whom He will save, He will have mercy on.  But they also knew
that it could be that God would not have mercy, that He would not save them. 
Therefore, they cried, &ldquo;<b>Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn</b>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would help us to understand that God permits us
sinners&mdash;and we are all in the same boat&mdash;to cry to Him for mercy, because crying
for mercy reinforces the truth that, of ourselves, we can do nothing to get
ourselves saved.  </p>

<p>Therefore, we go to God as a beggar, hopefully broken and
contrite and weighed down by our sin and the penalty of death for our sin.  We
go to the Lord, as He permits us to approach Him in this manner, and we say, &ldquo;O
Lord, have mercy on me a sinner.  There is nothing that I have ever done or can
do that should cause You to have mercy.  Only for Christ&rsquo;s sake and His great
mercy do I even ask, because I know that it is completely and entirely 100% in
Your hands if I become saved or not.  But could You, O Lord, have mercy on me? 
May it be possible that I might be one of Your elect.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Our situation can be likened to a prisoner on death row.  Why
would a prisoner be on death row?  Well, because he is guilty, and we are
guilty.  We have committed the crime.  We <span class="underline">have</span> transgressed God&rsquo;s Law.  This
is not a mistake; we are not accidentally there on death row.  We have truly
broken the Law of God and we deserve to die.  Justice would be served, actually,
if we did die.  </p>

<p>So we cannot go to God on any kind of a basis believing that
He should save us for anything that we might have done.  No, He will not listen
to that; but we can go to Him for what Christ has done.  Just as a prisoner might
write a note to a governor requesting pardon, so, too, the Lord allows us to
approach Him for pardon for Jesus&rsquo; sake.  </p>

<p>What kind of a note would a prisoner write?  Would he write
a note to the governor demanding that he be pardoned, &ldquo;You must set me free so that
I will not be electrocuted or hung until dead; you must set me free!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, no prisoner would be so stupid as to write such a note
as this to a governor, demanding his release.  No, a prisoner writes the most
respectful of letters and is very appreciative for the possibility that the
governor might read his note, &ldquo;Please, oh please, may you pardon me?&rdquo;  This would
be the outline of the letter.  </p>

<p>So, too, we can go to God very humbly and very respectfully,
knowing that He is upon the throne and that we are a sinful creature, a rebel
deserving to die, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy!  Have mercy because I do not deserve
your mercy.&rdquo;  This is how we go to God.  </p>

<p>How often should we go to Him and pray in this manner?  One
time?  Someone might think, &ldquo;Well, I asked God for mercy a while back and He
never heard me.&rdquo;  How about a hundred times?  Should we say, &ldquo;I will ask God
100 times&rdquo;?  Or a thousand?  </p>

<p>I do not know how many times my friend went to God asking Him
for mercy, but I do know this.  We cannot set any limit on God.  We cannot say,
&ldquo;God, I will ask You for mercy up until a point; but after that, I am done with
it!&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, we just humbly go to God.  By His grace, today is still
the day of salvation.  We have a little time, a little space between now and
the end; between now and May 21<sup>st</sup> when the door of mercy is shut
eternally on this world and on mankind.  From now until then, we are permitted
to continue to go to Him.  This is a great privilege that grows greater each
day, because this privilege will be removed after May 21<sup>st</sup>.  But we can
go to the Lord right now and say, &ldquo;O Lord, have mercy; please have mercy.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>Sometimes Jesus would hear someone crying out to Him and act
as if He did not hear.  He would test people at times and try them to see if
they would get discouraged.  Would they stop?  Would they go to some other
place?  </p>

<p>May none of us be discouraged.  May none of us go anywhere
else, for there is no other place.  Only Christ has &ldquo;<b>the words of eternal
life</b>,&rdquo; and God Himself would have us to continue to keep coming to Him and
approaching Him, as we read in Luke 18:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge,
which feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city;
and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for
a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor
regard man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge
saith.</p>

<p>You see, this is an account of an unjust judge.  But our
Judge is very just.  He is very holy and pure and right.  The God and judge of all
the earth <span class="underline">will</span> do right.  </p>

<p>If this poor widow woman could find her plea finally
answered by an unjust judge, may you be encouraged to lay hold of God in prayer
and determine, &ldquo;I do not know what is going to happen, but may I not be brought
down to the end of my life without earnestly going to the Lord and crying to
Him and not fainting.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>May the Lord have mercy on you.</p>
