<p>Hello and welcome.  There are only a few months remaining
until May 21 in 2011.  The question facing each one of us is, &ldquo;what are you and
I going to do with the days that we have left?&rdquo;  There are very few days left. 
What are we going to do with them?  </p>

<p>One good thing is that God is concerned with <span class="underline">today</span>. 
He tells us to forget &ldquo;<b>those things which are behind</b>&rdquo; and to look
forward.  </p>

<p>In Philippians, we are instructed to look at this day and at
the time that we have left.  It could be&mdash;and it probably is with most of
us&mdash;that as we think about our life up until this point, we could have wasted a
great deal of it.  In the world of our day, it is very easy to waste time.  We
waste time on books, on movies, on television, on computers.  We waste time in
an untold number of ways.  This could be the story of many of us and our lives
up until today.  However, this does not have to continue being the story.  </p>

<p>God is warning us that time is short.  We have from now
until then.  Perhaps&mdash;maybe if this is the Lord&rsquo;s will and if the Lord would be
gracious to us&mdash;He might permit us to live these last days as we really should
have always lived them, which is in obedience to Him and in doing things His
way rather than our own way.  </p>

<p>I think that the Lord gives us some good insight on what
would be pleasing to Him in this regard in 1 Peter 4:1-2.  It says there:  </p>

<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh
hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of <i>his </i>time
in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.  </p>

<p>There we have it.  There we have it!  God recognizes that we
have indeed lived our lives going our own way, doing our own thing, chasing our
own desires, agreeing with them and being on the same page with all of those
around us, with the people of the world as they have given us their ideas on
life.  </p>

<p>Well, now is the time.  Now is the point where God indicates
that we should &ldquo;<b>no longer live the rest of [<i>our</i>] time in the flesh</b>&rdquo;&mdash;these
few days that we have remaining&mdash;&ldquo;<b>to the lusts of men</b>.&rdquo;  This includes
our own self and our own lusts.  </p>

<p>If we are not to live &ldquo;<b>to the lusts of men</b>,&rdquo; what are
we to live to?  It said in 1 Peter 4:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;to the will of God.  </p>

<p>So what would God have us to do?  What is His will for you
and for me?  What is His will for the rest of our days, for &ldquo;<b>the rest of [<i>our</i>]
time in the flesh</b>&rdquo;?  Can we learn what this is from the Bible?  </p>

<p>The answer is, yes.  We can know what God would have us to
do.  He would have us to serve Him in ministering His Word and in sharing the
Gospel with as many people as possible.  He would have us to pray for our
family, to pray for our children.  </p>

<p>Perhaps they are unsuspecting.  Yes, they have heard about
May 21&mdash;more than likely from someone, maybe from you&mdash;but they are not taking
this seriously.  They are not changing the way that they live their lives, which
is a big indicator that they may not believe that this is the truth, that God
is extremely serious about this date.  </p>

<p>What we can do&mdash;and what would be according to the will of
God&mdash;is to pray for them like we have never prayed for them before.  Pray for our
wives and for our husbands.  Pray for our mothers and our fathers, for our
brothers and our sisters.  Pray for our children, but do not simply pray, &ldquo;O
Lord, have mercy on my son&rdquo; or &ldquo;have mercy on my daughter&rdquo; and then move on to
the next thing that we want to pray about.  Earnestly pray, &ldquo;O Lord, please
open their eyes.  Please save my son.  Please have mercy on him,&rdquo; and then continue
praying that the Lord might work that day, today, that He might work in bringing
the Gospel to our child&rsquo;s ears and open up their understanding so that they
might see their great danger and the desperate need that they have&mdash;that each
one of us has, including our children&mdash;to be reconciled to God before it is too
late.  Pray for five, ten, fifteen minutes, a half hour, an hour.  Pray for one
of our children.  The next day, pray for another, and so on.  We can pray and
we can share the Gospel in whatever way God would have us to do.  </p>

<p>Yes, God makes His will known to us.  We are obligated and
we are given the commission to share the Gospel.  The Gospel right now is
indicating that the sword of judgment is coming upon the people of the land and
we bear the responsibility to warn the people that the Day of Judgment is fast
approaching.  </p>

<p>Christ commands us and reveals the will of God for each one
of His people in Luke 19:13 when He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Occupy till I come.  </p>
