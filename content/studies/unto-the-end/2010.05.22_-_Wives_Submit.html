<p>Hello and welcome.  Today we will take a devotional journey
through the Bible as we head unto the end of the world.  </p>

<p>In Colossians 3, the Lord gives us sound council for living
in many areas of life.  For instance, it says in Colossians 3:17-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <i>do </i>all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Wives, submit
yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.  </p>

<p>This is the will of God for wives at any point in history. 
A wife that desires to please the Lord will attempt to obey God by submitting
to her husband, praying that the Lord would make her humble and able to obey
him in whatever His will might be for her in marriage.  </p>

<p>Wives, please consider that you now have only one year
remaining to serve God in your marriage.  You have one year left to submit as
the Lord would have you to do.  </p>

<p>Why submit?  Submit because this is the number one directive
that God gives to the wife.  </p>

<p>A wife naturally desires not to submit.  She feels often
that she can perhaps do things in a more orderly or better way than her
husband.  </p>

<p>Maybe the husband is not an individual who one would
naturally desire to submit to.  She may actually have an awful husband and the
marriage may be extremely difficult.  The husband may be rough and someone who
just makes the wife angry and the last person in the world whom she would want
to submit to.  However, God does not say, &ldquo;Wives, submit to your good husbands,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Wives, submit to your intelligent husbands,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wives, submit to the
husband who is worth submitting to.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>No, God does not specify what type of husband a wife is to
submit to.  He simply says, &ldquo;Wives, submit to your husbands, no matter what he
is like.&rdquo;  This is a very hard thing for the wife to do.  </p>

<p>Maybe even you, as a child of God, have not been able to do
this to the degree that you know that you should.  Your marriage may have
suffered because of this and your children may have also suffered because of
this.  </p>

<p>Well, here we are at the end.  Time is short.  We are coming
down to the wire on all things, and so is it not an excellent time for a wife
to go to the Lord and to pray to Him, &ldquo;O Father, please give me the strength
not to take over but to submit, to be humbly in submission to my husband as You
would have me to do?  May You give me a good conversation before him and my
family and all who know us.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Could it be that if your husband is a brute, if he is
unsaved and someone who cares nothing for God or for the Word of God, that he
might &ldquo;be won by the conversation of the wife&rdquo; as the Lord uses your witness
and your testimony over these last days?  </p>

<p>It may get difficult and it may be very hard, but may you go
to God often, beseeching Him for strength to witness to all in your marriage
relationship by obeying God in submitting to your husband.  </p>
