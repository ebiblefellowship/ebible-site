<p>Hello and welcome.  Please allow me to ask you a question
today.  If Jesus were on the earth at this time&mdash;as He was in 33 A.D. and for a
few years before that when the Lord Jesus entered into the world and took upon
Himself a human nature and became man&mdash;if Christ were on the earth at this time
in our day, would you stop whatever you were doing and go to Him for help in
your infirmity?  </p>

<p>The truth is that each one of us has a very great
infirmity.  Yes, there are many people who have physical infirmities.  They are
paralyzed or they are cancer-stricken or they are blind or deaf or dumb, as
many people were in the days when Christ did walk on the earth in the first
century A.D.  Yet beyond this and more than this, the great infirmity of every
person, of each human being, is our sin-sickness, which is that we are born
into the world with a sin nature and we are dead in our sins and we are under
the wrath of God because of our sins.  </p>

<p>Now, if Jesus were in the world today&mdash;and, of course, this
is just setting up a scenario that could never happen because God sent &ldquo;<b>the
Son</b>&rdquo; in the fullness of time and at the proper time, but I am just using
this idea to get us to think about prayer&mdash;the truth is that if Christ were in
the world today, maybe even in our own city, such as Philadelphia or New York
or Washington, D.C., or in any city, you and I and multitudes of people would
travel, without hesitation, to Philadelphia or to New York to try to find
Jesus.  We would hop on transportation or drive our cars, just as many took
shipping, to find where this miracle-working Prophet was in order to be touched
by Him or to even just &ldquo;<b>touch the hem of his garment</b>,&rdquo; trusting that if
we were able to touch Him, we would be healed.  We do find instances of this in
the Gospel accounts.  </p>

<p>You know, we would go out of our way in order to go to Christ
and to speak to Him personally, to see Him in a physical body and to hear the
words from His mouth that our sins are forgiven, as He said to the paralyzed
man, &ldquo;<b>Son, thy sins be forgiven thee</b>.&rdquo;  After hearing Him say this, the
Pharisees wondered, &ldquo;<b>Who can forgive sins but God only</b>?&rdquo;  They missed
the point.  This was what Jesus was saying.  He was &ldquo;<b>Emmanuel, which being
interpreted is, God with us</b>.&rdquo;  He was &ldquo;<b>God&hellip;in the flesh</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, Jesus is not on earth at this time in the world and He
has not been since 33 A.D.  He has sent His Spirit into the
world, but He is not in the world as He was then.  However, the very same
Jesus, the very same compassionate and merciful Saviour, &ldquo;<b>full of grace and
truth</b>,&rdquo; full of goodness and kindness, this same God who heard the prayers
and the beseechings of afflicted men in His day in this world, is seated upon &ldquo;<b>the
throne</b>.&rdquo;  He is at &ldquo;<b>the right hand of God</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>His throne</b>&rdquo;
is a &ldquo;<b>throne of grace</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is true that Christ, as He is &ldquo;<b>in
the heavenlies</b>,&rdquo; is far more accessible today to any person in the world
than He was when He was &ldquo;<b>in the days of his flesh</b>.&rdquo;  The reason is that
it might be more convenient for you or for me to go to the nearest big city if Christ
were there, but there is still a whole world out there that could never
possibly reach Him.  Yet God has made Himself so accessible that any individual
in Russia or China or India or Africa or Australia or Japan or America, and
even simultaneously, can simply close their eyes in prayer, no matter where
they are.  Instantaneously, they have access to the &ldquo;<b>throne of grace</b>&rdquo;
that the Lord Jesus sits upon.  </p>

<p>We can go to the very same Person, the very same Saviour who
heard the pleas of the afflicted.  He is the same God and He is as close to us
as possible.  Far more does the possibility exist for us to go to Him, for
anyone to go to Him now, than ever before.  You or I may speak to this same
Saviour who heard the cries of the blind and the deaf and the dumb and the
lame, the same One who, without fail, healed all of these people.  Yet we
should not think that this means that whatever we beseech Christ for, He must
do.  No, this is never to be our thought.  But we can realize that God is
showing us how compassionate He is and how He &ldquo;<b>is a merciful God</b>,&rdquo;

abundantly &ldquo;<b>full of mercy</b>&rdquo; to those whom He draws to Himself and who, as
a result, do come to Him.  This same Jesus is accessible through prayer.  </p>

<p>Why is it then that we do not, excitedly and diligently,
drop everything that is going on in our lives and go to this Saviour for
mercy?  Why do we not take our great sin problem to the Lord Jesus Christ
immediately, right now?  If it is true that we would run to Him if He were
physically on this earth, why do we not run to Him in prayer, which is actually
an easier way of approaching Him?  </p>

<p>What is the reason for this?  Could it be that we desire the
physical presence of Christ, because that takes no faith?  Could it be because
we could see a body and we could see the miracles being done as, right before
their eyes, many people did in the first century A.D.?  Is this the problem? 
Is it because we have no eyes of faith that we do not go to Him as He is seated
&ldquo;<b>upon the throne</b>&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Jesus uses Thomas as an example of someone who would not
believe it unless he saw it or he would not believe it unless he felt it.  We
find in John 20 the account where Jesus finally appears to Thomas.  He says in
John 20:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <i>it </i>into my side: and be not
faithless, but believing.  </p>

<p>This was because Thomas had earlier said that unless he saw
Him and touched Him and thrust his hand into His side where the spear had
penetrated, he would not believe.  Jesus, in great condescension, comes to
Thomas and tells him to do these things that he had said, and then we read in
John 20:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.  </p>

<p>At this point, Thomas is convinced and sees the truth that
Jesus is the Great Jehovah, the Saviour of &ldquo;<b>his people</b>&rdquo;; and in John
20:29, Jesus responds in a way that is for our benefit as well as for Thomas&rsquo;: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
hast believed: blessed <i>are </i>they that have not seen, and <i>yet </i>have
believed.  </p>

<p>We do not need to see Jesus to know that He is the Great God
of the Bible.  He is the Great &ldquo;<b>I AM</b>,&rdquo; the only Saviour.  It is through
Him and only through Him whereby we can enter into Heaven.  </p>

<p>God has laid all of this out and He encourages us and
implores us to go to Him, to His &ldquo;<b>throne of grace</b>,&rdquo; to see if He is not
just as kind and gracious and merciful as He was &ldquo;<b>in the days of his flesh</b>.&rdquo; 
May we not be held back by the fact that Jesus is not in the world.  Instead,
may we see with eyes of faith.  May God give us those eyes of faith and may the

&ldquo;<b>faith of </b><b>Chris</b><b>t</b>&rdquo; save us as we do go to Him.  </p>

<p>Go to Him today as you would if you had heard that He was
downtown.  Go to Him with great excitement and great expectation, &ldquo;<b>casting
all your care upon him</b>,&rdquo; and beseeching Him, &ldquo;O Lord, it is not physical
eyes that I desire nor physical hearing nor physical legs.  My desire, O Lord,
is for You to grant me spiritual eyes that I might see and spiritual ears that
I might hear and spiritual legs that I might walk in Thy commandments and
spiritual life that I might rise up from the dead.&rdquo;  </p>
