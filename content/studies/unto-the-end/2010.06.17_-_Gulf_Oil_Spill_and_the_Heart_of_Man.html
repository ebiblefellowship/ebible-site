<p>Hello.  Welcome to &ldquo;Unto the End of the World,&rdquo; a devotional
that takes a look at Bible passages in light of the information that we are
close to the day of judgment.  </p>

<p>Today we will be taking a slight detour in order to discuss
the Gulf oil spill and how it can be compared to the heart of man.  Yes, I know
that this sounds like an unusual comparison; but let us consider, as you are
probably aware, that millions upon millions of gallons of oil have been gushing
into the Gulf of Mexico for some time now, for many weeks.  </p>

<p>This accident ranks as America&rsquo;s worst environmental tragedy
in history.  It is one of the worst environmental disasters that the world has
ever seen.  Crews have been working for weeks to clean up this mess in the Gulf
region, but this battle to clean up the oil and to protect the coastline seems
to be almost an impossible task while the leak in the ocean floor continues to
spew great amounts of oil into the water.  </p>

<p>This disaster clean-up paints a very vivid and accurate
picture of man&rsquo;s battle against sin.  In the Bible, God commands man to
repent.  We are to repent of our sin, which the Bible has nothing good to say
about.  It is typified as dirty and filthy, and this is why stinky and sludgy
oil is a good representation, really, of what spiritually goes on within the
heart of man.  It is all manner of wickedness and filthiness.  When we see the
images of the oil washing up on the pure, white beaches of Florida or Alabama
or Louisiana, we really are getting a good representation of man&rsquo;s own sinful
nature and his spiritual filthiness before God.  </p>

<p>Sin, like this leaking oil, fouls everything it touches.  We
find that these crews are working hard as they clean up a beach or as they
clean up a marshland or as they set booms to prevent the oil from reaching
land, and yet it seems to be never-ending because the oil keeps coming.  </p>

<p>While this oil is gushing forth out of the ocean bottom, how
can the clean-up crews really make any headway at all?  Regardless of how hard
they try, it seems that the clean-up effort just cannot get to this mess.  </p>

<p>Again, God tells us; actually, He commands us&mdash;He is not
asking&mdash;He commands, &ldquo;Repent!  Repent!&rdquo; for He has established a day in which He
will judge the world.  We know that this day is May 21 of the year 2011 and
that &ldquo;God&hellip;now commandeth all men every where to repent.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Many people, a good number of people, very well may hear
this information about Judgment Day and realize, &ldquo;I have to turn.  I have to
repent from my sin,&rdquo; and so they quit drinking or perhaps they stop smoking. 
They realize that they are going to have to avoid cursing and to stop using foul
language.  </p>

<p>You see, they are cleaning up their act.  They realize that
these things are contrary to living a good life and to obeying the Law of God. 
So in a very similar way, they are trying to clean up their words and the
things that they do, very much like these crews are trying to clean up the
effects of the oil; and yet there is a greater problem.  </p>

<p>All of us see this when it comes to the Gulf oil
catastrophe.  We realize that the oil is still gushing.  Even if they make
excellent headway in cleaning up the results of this on the beaches, in the
marshes, or in any of the other areas, we understand that the real problem is
deep-seated and at the very bottom of the ocean.  It is not only in that hole
5,000-feet down, but it goes much deeper into the heart of the earth.  They
have drilled further down and tremendous amounts of oil are gushing, they are
gushing out of this broken pipe and leaking into the ocean.  This is the
problem.  </p>

<p>As we watch this disaster continue to unfold, we realize
that they have to stop the leak.  This is the number one thing.  All of the
other efforts are noble.  They are, of course, necessary and have to be done;
so, too, as God commands us to repent.  Yes, indeed, stop drinking, stop
smoking, stop doing drugs, stop cursing, stop lusting after others in your mind,
stop coveting.  Do all that you can to stop; and yet, however, there is a
deeper problem than the outward clean-up.  </p>

<p>Jesus puts His finger on the heart of this problem in
Matthew 15.  Please allow me to turn there and I will read a few verses.  We
read in Matthew 15:18-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from
the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: These
are <i>the things </i>which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands
defileth not a man.  </p>

<p>You see, this is the problem that we have.  Throw away the
cigarettes.  Stop going to the bar.  Yes, yes!  This is part of repentance. 
But when God commands of man to repent, this means that man is to turn from the
evil that is within him, to turn from a gushing sewer, a gushing cesspool of
iniquity that is flowing forth from his heart.  </p>

<p>A great problem that people have is they think, &ldquo;If I can
clean up outwardly&mdash;if I can clean up the beach, as we continue to use this
analogy of the oil spill&mdash;if I can clean this up, then all is well between me
and God.&rdquo;  But no, not while there is a broken oil rig and oil is gushing forth,
because the filthiness is still there and there is pollution.  </p>

<p>This is, likewise, the same problem while man still has &ldquo;an
evil heart of unbelief,&rdquo; because the Bible has nothing good to say about a
person&rsquo;s heart prior to salvation.  It says of man that we have a &ldquo;desperately
wicked&rdquo; and &ldquo;deceitful&rdquo; heart.  It says that we have a heart of stone, a heart
of unbelief, a heart where all manner of evil proceeds forth.  It is flowing
out into our lives and this is why we do wrong things and think wrong things
and say wrong things; this is the problem.  </p>

<p>The answer for the oil well is that, hopefully, someday
soon, by God&rsquo;s grace, they will figure out how to stop the oil.  But the answer
for man&rsquo;s heart is that no man can repent of his own heart.  No man can turn
off this flow of iniquity.  This is why the Bible says that we need &ldquo;a new
heart and a new spirit,&rdquo; and yet we cannot do this ourselves.  </p>

<p>I will read a few more verses.  In Ezekiel 36, we read of
what God does with those whom He saves.  It says in Ezekiel 36:25-27:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A
new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I
will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart
of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do <i>them.</i>  </p>

<p>Then we read in Ezekiel 36:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.  </p>

<p>We find here the solution of how to stop the spewing forth
of sin, how to plug the hole in our own hearts, in a sense.  We go to God and
we beseech Him, &ldquo;O Lord, this is something that I cannot do.  You command me to
repent, and I will turn from the things that I can turn from, but there is no
way that I can turn from my own heart.  This is why I need a Saviour.  I need
You to have mercy on me and to cleanse me and to give me a new heart in order
that filthy sins can no longer come forth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This is the prayer that we need to make as we go to God and
ask Him to have mercy upon us before this appointed day of judgment arrives.  </p>
