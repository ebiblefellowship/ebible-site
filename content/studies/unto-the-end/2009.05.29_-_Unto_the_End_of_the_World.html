<p>Hello and welcome to this weekly devotional time in the
Bible.  The name of this time of devotions is &ldquo;Unto the End of the World.&rdquo; 
This phrase is taken from the Gospel of Matthew, Matthew 28:19-20, where it
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you
alway, <i>even </i>unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>

<p>These verses have been the guiding light&mdash;they have been the
marching orders of the people of God&mdash;through the centuries.  Since the Lord
Jesus first spoke them, the Lord&rsquo;s people have been going into the world with
the Gospel.  </p>

<p>There have been large numbers of Christians, of believers,
who have packed up their belongings and traveled into far lands and foreign
lands in order to share the Word of God with the natives on a remote island or
in Africa or in India or in China.  God&rsquo;s people have suffered and given up
their lives in order to bring the Bible&rsquo;s message of salvation to the people of
the world.  </p>

<p>Of course, they did not think that this was a great thing. 
They knew that they themselves had eternal life through the salvation that is
presented by the Bible.  Therefore, their life in this world was not counted
great to them.  They willingly, in a way of desiring to serve their Lord, gave
up their life in order to share the Bible&rsquo;s message with other people.  </p>

<p>Now in our day, which is the time of the Great Tribulation, we
are coming down to the wire&mdash;that is one expression&mdash;or we are coming to the end
of the race, as God does look at the whole Christian life as a race.  Just as
the Apostle Paul says that he finished his course, so all the children of God
will soon finish their course.  This will take place on May 21<sup>st</sup> in
2011.  </p>

<p>The Lord had sealed up a great deal of information in the
Bible, and yet it was not to be sealed forever.  It was sealed until the time
of the end.  Now that we are living at the time of the end, God is opening up
the seals from the Bible and He is revealing to His people information
concerning time and judgment, as well as purifying and opening up the eyes of
the people of God to truths concerning salvation.  </p>

<p>Here we are very close to this date of May 21, 2011.  This day will be the end of the world, but the Lord Jesus is still with us.  He is with
His people.  We no longer need to sell all that we have or to pack up our
belongings and gather our family and take shipping to go to a distant land in
order to bring the Gospel message.  </p>

<p>No, the Lord, in His tremendous wisdom, has opened up the
technology of the electronic medium over the last decade, or several decades, to
such a degree that the Bible message is able to go out over the airwaves
through radio and shortwave radio or through satellite broadcasting or through
many, many other means.  Even television is used somewhat in the sending forth
of the Gospel to the world.  </p>

<p>This was done by God.  He is the One in charge of what men
know or what they are held back from knowing.  For most of history, the world
did not have electronics like we do today.  There were not airplanes or
automobiles or all of this great machinery: the phone system, radio, television
and Internet.  These things did not exist for most of earth&rsquo;s 13,000 plus years
of history.  </p>

<p>But the Lord, knowing that He would have to get His Word out
to the world in order to save a great multitude of people during this time of
the Great Tribulation that we are in, made provision for these technological
advances of mankind in order to accomplish His purpose.  Yes, man abuses it and
uses it for wicked means and endeavors, but God will accomplish His purpose in
sending forth His Word to the world.  </p>

<p>This is what has been going on for the last several years
during this period of the Latter Rain, and this is what will continue unto the
end of the world on May 21<sup>st</sup> in 2011.  And we are just greatly
privileged as ambassadors for Christ, as representatives of the Lord Jesus, as
servants to God, in that we can share His Word through this medium, the
electronic medium, with multitudes of people.  </p>

<p>Well, during the time of this weekly devotional, we will be
taking a look at a verse or a passage of Scripture that will have a particular
relationship to the day that we are living in.  If you think about it, here we
are just a short distance from the end.  It is very close.  Before we know it,
time will fly by and the day will be upon us.  We have Bibles in our houses or
in stores that are available, and yet now time is becoming exceedingly precious
and rare.  </p>

<p>So what are we going to do with our time?  When it comes to
looking at the Bible, all Scripture is profitable and good and can be used of
God.  Yet there are certain Scriptures that naturally draw our attention since
we are approaching the very end of the world.  </p>

<p>So during this time of this weekly devotional, &ldquo;Unto the End
of the World,&rdquo; we will be taking a look at certain Bible verses and passages
that will be offered as an assist and a help for others to consider and to turn
to in order to understand that the Lord has been pleading; He has been
beseeching through His people.  This is the way that He has set up the salvation
program.  </p>

<p>For instance, in 2 Corinthians 5:19-20, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us
the word of reconciliation.  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though
God did beseech <i>you </i>by us: we pray <i>you </i>in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye
reconciled to God.</p>

<p>We can see how God has used individuals.  He has used His
people to bring the Gospel message to others on His behalf.  </p>

<p>So the Lord has been bringing His Word to the people of the
world, maybe even to you, for quite some time now.  Again and again, you are
hearing the Gospel message.  Will you not be reconciled to God?  The Lord
Himself is beseeching you through His people.  </p>

<p>This is why we read of those who bring the good news, the
good tidings, and God says, &ldquo;<b>How beautiful are the feet of them that&hellip;bring
glad tidings of good things</b>!&rdquo;  Yet in another place, it is almost an exact
quote; however, it is slightly changed, &ldquo;<b>How beautiful&hellip;are the feet of <span class="underline">him</span>
that bringeth good tidings</b>.&rdquo;  This is because, as we come with the Word of
God, it is God who is being represented.  </p>

<p>The Ninevites understood this.  This is why when Jonah went
into Nineveh and cried out, &ldquo;<b>Yet forty days, and </b><b>Nineveh</b><b> shall
be overturned</b>!,&rdquo; we read in Jonah 3:5 that the Ninevites &ldquo;<b>believed God</b>,&rdquo;
not Jonah.  Jonah was only a messenger, only a servant, but they believed the
One who sent him.  </p>

<p>Will you not at this time&mdash;not tomorrow, not next week, not
some far-off distant time&mdash;but will you not right now at this time understand
the Word of the Lord, understand what time it is and what day you are living in
and understand that you are about to die?  </p>

<p>God takes &ldquo;<b>no pleasure in the death of the wicked</b>&rdquo; or
you.  He takes no pleasure in the death of those who have rebelled against
Him.  He &ldquo;<b>delighteth <i>in </i>mercy</b>&rdquo; and takes pleasure in saving His
elect people.  </p>

<p>We do not know who are the elect or who are not, and so it
could be that you are one of God&rsquo;s elect.  Therefore, why will you not take up
your Bible today?  Take up your Word and begin reading and praying to the Lord
that He might have mercy; because it could be that He will grant you His
mercy.  </p>
