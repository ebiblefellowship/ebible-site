<p>Hello and welcome.  May I ask you a question?  As you have
been hearing about May 21, 2011 being the date of the Rapture and October 21, 2011
being the end of the world, and as you have heard the information from the
Bible that does conclusively point to these dates, and as you have you have
studied this information and heard teaching about the approaching end of the
world and what this means for true believers in relation to the Lord Jesus coming
to fulfill His promise that the Word of God has made since the very beginning,
how do you feel about this?  </p>

<p>Throughout the Bible, God has promised that there would come
a time when &ldquo;the land&rdquo; would be inhabited eternally.  He was not speaking of
the land of Israel.  God pointed to that land and spoke of the land of Canaan
as an eternal habitation, but that is not what He had in mind.  What He had in
mind was what the land of Canaan spiritually pointed to, which was the new
heavens and the new earth.  </p>

<p>The Lord has made it abundantly clear, again and again in
the Bible, that this world will have an end and that God will make a final end
of the rebellion of mankind, the unsaved of the world.  He will &ldquo;<b>finish the
transgression</b>&rdquo; and He will completely destroy the unsaved, the ones that
the Lord Jesus never died for. They will have an end.  Again and again, the
Bible has referred to this in its various books and in its various chapters.  </p>

<p>We are now finally at the point when &ldquo;<b>all things which
are written may be fulfilled</b>&rdquo; in relation to this world and to the promises
of God in the Bible.  All that God has spoken will soon come to pass; and, of
course, it must.  The Bible is the Word of God and His Word is faithful and
true; therefore, it must be fulfilled perfectly and without fail.  </p>

<p>So as you have heard the information about May 21, 2011, may I ask how you have felt?  What do I mean by this?  When you are hearing
that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming, how have you reacted in your self, not
outwardly, but in your mind, in your heart?  Are you encouraged?  Are you
excited?  Are you joyful?  Are you happy? Are you comforted by this
information?  Or are you troubled in mind?  Are you disturbed?  Are you agitated?
Are you fearful, which could be a good reaction if you are not saved.  </p>

<p>You see, it is important how we are responding to this
news.  When the Lord Jesus came the first time as the Messiah, when He entered
into the human race after 11,000 years of history, as well as throughout the
history of the nation of Israel, the cry of the people of God at that time, the
Jews, was a longing for the Messiah to come, at least this is what they would
profess outwardly.  This is what they would say if you would ask them, &ldquo;Do you
want the Messiah to come?&rdquo;  Their response would have most likely been, &ldquo;Oh, of
course I long for the day that the Messiah will come!&rdquo;  Even the people at the
time when Christ did come would have given an answer similar to this.  They
were good Jews.  They knew that the Bible promised that a Christ would come, that
the great Prophet that Moses spoke of would come and that He would be the Saviour. 
</p>

<p>Let us look again at the time when the wise men came from
the east with the information that they were following His star.  They came to Jerusalem
and &ldquo;<b>Herod&hellip;was troubled&rdquo;</b> when he heard of the information that these
wise men were bringing.  He should have been troubled.  He was a very wicked
and evil man, and so we would expect him to be troubled.  But we also read, &ldquo;<b>and
all </b><b>Jerusalem</b><b> with him</b>.&rdquo;  The Jewish leaders were also troubled
by this news.  They knew exactly what the wise men were referring to because
Herod later asked them &ldquo;<b>where Christ should be born</b>&rdquo; and they told him &ldquo;<b>in

</b><b>Bethlehem</b>.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Bethlehem was the prophecy that was written about concerning
where the Messiah would be born.  They knew this and yet their response and their
reaction was not one of great joy as the angels had or as the shepherds had or
as God&rsquo;s true people would have.  Their reaction was one of being troubled of
mind and troubled of spirit.  </p>

<p>This continued, of course.  Later in Jesus&rsquo; ministry, there
was not a glad reception of the Messiah but one of agitation and of hatred of
Christ, of God Himself.  As He dwelt among His own people, they did not rejoice
that He had come.</p>

<p>This is why this is such an important question.  Each one of
us should ask ourselves this question.  What is my response to the news that
the Lord Jesus is coming again in fulfillment of His promise that He would
come?  He is coming for His people, His elect.  How do I feel about this?  </p>

<p>Our response should be, &ldquo;Could it be, O Lord, that I would
rejoice in heart, that I would just be so happy to think that, finally, all of
Your prophecy is coming to fulfillment!  What a joyful future there is for the
child of God as You create a new heavens and a new earth where there will be no
more tears, nor sorrow, nor death!&rdquo;  And we can see why the believer would
rejoice, as we read what God tells us in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18:</p>

<p class="verse">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive <i>and </i>remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
