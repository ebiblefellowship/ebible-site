<p>Hello and welcome.  During this brief devotional time, we
will be taking a look at the Bible and examining Scripture in the light of our
direction, which is heading unto the end of the world because God&rsquo;s people now
know that May 21 of the year 2011 will be Judgment Day.  We have very little
time from now until then.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 19:7-9, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">The law of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of JEHOVAH <i>are
</i>right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>pure,
enlightening the eyes. The fear of JEHOVAH <i>is </i>clean, enduring for ever:
the judgments of JEHOVAH <i>are </i>true <i>and </i>righteous altogether.  </p>

<p>All of these statements are referring to the Bible, the Word
of God, and God gives His Word many different names.  It is called &ldquo;statutes&rdquo;
or &ldquo;laws&rdquo; or &ldquo;commandments&rdquo; or &ldquo;judgments.&rdquo;  At times, it is also called &ldquo;the
word&rdquo;; but all of these names are all referring to the very same thing: the
Word of God, the Bible.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 19:10-11, as it continues speaking about the Bible,
it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">More to be desired <i>are they </i>than gold, yea, than much
fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy
servant warned&hellip;  </p>

<p>By the Word of God, God&rsquo;s servants, His people, are warned. 
</p>

<p>It happens to be a Biblical pattern that God forewarns His
servants prior to times of judgment.  This pattern was followed in the days of
Noah as God gave Noah advance warning concerning the flood.  This pattern was
followed in the days of Lot as God first informed Abraham and then Lot and his
family of the coming destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  This pattern was
followed in the city of Nineveh as God sent Jonah to warn the Ninevites.  </p>

<p>Repeatedly in the Bible, God has demonstrated that prior to
judgment, prior to destruction, He will warn His people.  Of course, since He
did this in the lesser types of Judgment Day, we can definitely gather that He
will do this with the actual day of judgment, which we now know will be coming
on May 21 in the year 2011.  This is fully in keeping with the pattern that God
Himself has established.  </p>

<p>How is He warning us?  Will we hear a voice from Heaven
saying, &ldquo;May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>No, there will be no voice from Heaven.  This is not
possible because the Bible is complete.  God gave His revelation in full and
completed it by the end of the first century A.D.  Never again will He bring
additional revelation in this way.  </p>

<p>Will He give us a dream or a vision or a tongue?  </p>

<p>Absolutely not!  These would all be supernatural revelations,
and God has stated that He will not do this.  </p>

<p>So how can He warn His people prior to the judgment of the
end of the world?  </p>

<p>He can warn them in the way in which He has been warning
them: through His Word, the Bible, as it says here in Psalm 19:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by them&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the statutes, the judgments, the laws,
the commandments, the Word of God, the Bible.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;by them is thy servant warned&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are hearing all of this information concerning the
appointed day of judgment, and it is not based on anything other than the
Bible.  This is all coming out of the Bible; therefore, this ought to be taken
very seriously by anyone who is hearing these things because God wrote the
Bible and God knows the end from the beginning.  </p>

<p>God gave this information in His Word.  He is very capable
of putting end-time information in the Bible and keeping it concealed until the
proper time, which is exactly where we are.  We are at the time of the end and
now God is forewarning us, just as He did Noah and others in the Bible.  He is
telling us to trust Him, to trust His Word, to believe Him and to realize that
our lives are coming to an end because this world will no longer continue.  </p>
