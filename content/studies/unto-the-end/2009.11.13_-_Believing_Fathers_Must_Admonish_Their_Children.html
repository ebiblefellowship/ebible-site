<p>Hello and welcome.  Recently we have learned from the Bible
that May 21 in the year 2011 will be Judgment Day.  Since this information
comes directly from the Bible, the Word of God, God&rsquo;s people trust it, believe
it, and know that this is going to take place.  </p>

<p>Possessing this information cannot help but influence
everything that we do in our lives.  Understanding that the end is at hand
ought to impact all areas of our lives.  For instance, our families, we have
husbands or wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, and other
relations.  </p>

<p>Well today, let us think about how knowing these things that
are coming forth from the Bible concerning time and judgment ought to affect
our children, the Christian&rsquo;s raising of his children, the father who desires
to bring up his children under the care and protection of the Lord.  </p>

<p>The Bible tells us this in Ephesians 6:4:</p>

<p class="verse">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  </p>

<p>Yes, a believing father desires greatly to share the Gospel
with his children.  The father does not pick and choose what truths from the
Bible to teach; he teaches whatever he has learned from the Bible.  </p>

<p>Of course, since we have learned about May 21, 2011 and we
are getting ever closer to this day, any father who is in fear and trembling
for his own children, who loves them so much and so greatly, will want to give
this information to his son or to his daughter, to his little ones.  Even if
they are not that little, the believing father just desires that God might have
mercy and save one or two or all of his children.  I think that this is really
the prayer of every father and mother, that all of their children might be
saved.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 11 is a chapter that outlines the faith of Christ
and certain people of God who received God&rsquo;s gift of faith.  In Hebrews 11:20,
it says:</p>

<p class="verse">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
</p>

<p>This was quite a long time ago, thousands of years ago, but
it was the same Gospel.  It was the same Bible truths that we have today
concerning judgment and salvation.  So, too, with father Isaac and with his
twin sons, Jacob and Esau, which God uses elsewhere in the Bible to typify the
saved and unsaved of the world.  </p>

<p>Isaac loved both of them.  Yes, he preferred Esau.  He
enjoyed eating some of the meals that Esau would cook after hunting; but
really, he loved both of his children.  Every father loves his children,
whether they give evidence of salvation or not.  </p>

<p>So we read that Isaac blessed both Jacob and Esau &ldquo;concerning
things to come.&rdquo;  He did not hold back.  He did not just reveal some things.  Whatever
Isaac knew that was true about God and man&rsquo;s condition and our desperate need
of a Saviour, he imparted that knowledge to both of his sons.  In doing so, he
was bringing them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord.  </p>

<p>This is what we are to do, the fathers and mothers of our
day who know these things, who know that the end is coming.  We cannot just sit
down and have discussions with our children about college education or, &ldquo;Oh,
will it not be wonderful when you grow up and get married and have children of
your own?&rdquo;  We would love to talk to them about future occupations, about being
a doctor or a lawyer or a policeman or a soldier, things far off in the
distance; but no, we cannot get into these discussions.  We have to stop them
and say, &ldquo;Son, daughter, please understand, the future that you are talking about
is never going to come because the end is at hand.&rdquo;   </p>

<p>We must share this truth that we have learned from the Bible
with them, praying all the while, &ldquo;O Lord, open their eyes, open their ears
that they might understand and see and take warning.&rdquo;   </p>
