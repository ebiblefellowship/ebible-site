<p>Turn to Job 40.  I thought I would do some messages on the
book of Job.  My parents made us go to church when we were young.  When I
became a teenager, I rebelled.  Still, off and on at different times in my
life, I have been under the hearing of the Word, but I have never heard many
studies or sermons from the book of Job.  This book seems to be more difficult to
sort out and to understand, possibly because it is older.  I am not sure.  I do
not think that anyone has ever pinned down exactly the time that these events were
taking place.  We will look at Job&rsquo;s three friends.  Perhaps they give us some
hints.  I believe that the timeframe is anywhere from 1800 B.C. to the time of
the exodus.  It is somewhere in there, but no one is sure.  </p>

<p>I would like to just read right now from Job 40 and then we
will go back to the beginning to get a little bit of an overview of the whole
book.  We read in Job 40:1-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover JEHOVAH answered Job, and said, Shall he that
contendeth with the Almighty instruct <i>him? </i>he that reproveth God, let
him answer it. Then Job answered JEHOVAH, and said, Behold, I am vile; what
shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken;
but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. Then answered
JEHOVAH unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Gird up thy loins now like a
man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. Wilt thou also disannul
my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? Hast thou an
arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? Deck thyself now <i>with
</i>majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. Cast
abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one <i>that is </i>proud, and
abase him. Look on every one <i>that is </i>proud, <i>and </i>bring him low;
and tread down the wicked in their place. Hide them in the dust together; <i>and
</i>bind their faces in secret. Then will I also confess unto thee that thine
own right hand can save thee.  </p>

<p>We will get back to this in a little bit.  </p>

<p>If we turn back to the beginning of Job, we read in Job
1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job;
and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed
evil.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;eschewed&rdquo; means &ldquo;to put away,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;to put away
evil.&rdquo;  This also says, &ldquo;That man was perfect.&rdquo;  This means that Job was
saved.  God had imputed the righteousness of Christ to Job.  Therefore, when
God looked at Job, He saw the perfection of Christ.  Job was a saved man, but
it is generally known that Job was also a figure of Christ; and so we will look
at the affliction that God put on him.  As we look at Job&rsquo;s faithfulness, we
will see Christ all through this book of Job.  </p>

<p>So Job 1:1 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job;
and that man was <span class="underline">perfect [</span><i>tam:H8535</i>]&hellip;  </p>

<p>Turn to the Song of Solomon.  We know that the Song of
Solomon is an exchange between Christ and His Bride, the church.  It is an
exchange of love, and we read in Song 5:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">I am come into my garden, my sister, <i>my </i>spouse: I have
gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I
have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly,
O beloved.  </p>

<p>In Song 5:2, it is now the church speaking.  We read in Song
5:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">I sleep, but my heart waketh: <i>it is </i>the voice of my
beloved that knocketh, <i>saying, </i>Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove,
my <span class="underline">undefiled</span> [<i>tam:H8535</i>]&hellip;   </p>

<p>&ldquo;Undefiled&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; that we find in Job 1:1.  </p>

<p>Song 5:2 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my <span class="underline">undefiled</span> [<i>tam:H8535</i>]&hellip; 
 </p>

<p>The true Church or the true believers are &ldquo;undefiled&rdquo;
because they are perfect in the eyes of Christ.  This goes on to say:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my <span class="underline">undefiled</span> [<i>tam:H8535</i>]:
for my head is filled with dew, <i>and </i>my locks with the drops of the
night.  </p>

<p>So we read again in Job 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job;
and that man was <span class="underline">perfect [</span><i>tam:H8535</i>] and upright, and one that
feared God, and eschewed [<i>put away</i>] evil.  </p>

<p>The land of Uz was in the land of Edom.  We can see this in
Lamentations 4.  God is speaking about judgment in this book, but Lamentations
is certainly the lament of Jeremiah when Jerusalem was destroyed.  God is now
speaking about how the nations that have fought against Jerusalem would be
destroyed.  He is speaking about Edom and He says in Lamentations 4:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land
 of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and
shalt make thyself naked.  </p>

<p>So Edom is associated with the land of Uz where Job is
from.  </p>

<p>Again, the whole book of Job is a parable of the sufferings
of Christ.  In the Bible, Esau is a picture of Satan.  He was a twin brother of
Jacob and he was as much a full-blooded son of Isaac as Jacob was; but he is a
picture of Satan.  </p>

<p>We read in Isaiah 63 of Christ coming from suffering the
wrath of God for the sins of the elect, and He speaks of this as having been
performed in Edom.  If Esau is a picture of Satan, certainly Edom would be a
picture of hell.  Isaiah 63:1-3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who <i>is </i>this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments
from Bozrah? this <i>that is </i>glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore
<i>art thou </i>red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth
in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people <i>there
was </i>none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in
my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain
all my raiment.  </p>

<p>He is speaking of having suffered the wrath of God.  His garments
are stained with blood and He is anticipating the final judgment when there
will be again that blood.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury;
and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments&hellip;  </p>

<p>So the land of Uz is associated with Edom, and it says again
in Job 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz&hellip;  </p>

<p>This does not say that Job was from the land of Uz or of the
  land of Uz.  It just says that he was &ldquo;in the land of Uz.&rdquo;  Again, this whole
story is a parable of Christ suffering the wrath of God; and, here, Job is in
the land of Uz.  </p>

<p>We then read:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;whose name <i>was </i><span class="underline">Job</span> [<i>'iyowb:H347</i>]&hellip;  </p>

<p>The word &ldquo;Job&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; or &ldquo;hated,&rdquo; as in
someone who is hated.  In the atonement, it was as if Christ was under the
hatred of God or it was as if He was an enemy.  </p>

<p>Look at Job 13.  This is Job speaking.  Job 13:20-23 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Only do not two <i>things </i>unto me: then will I not hide
myself from thee. Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make
me afraid. Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou
me. How many <i>are </i>mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
transgression and my sin.  </p>

<p>In a couple of places in this book, Job is speaking as if he
wants to speak to God and ask him why this suffering is upon him.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Job 13:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine <span class="underline">enemy</span>
[<i>'oyeb:H341</i>]?  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; is a form of the same word that the name
Job comes from.  In the atonement, it is as if Christ is the enemy of God. 
This is why this man&rsquo;s name is Job.  </p>

<p>Again, we read in Job 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job;
and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed
evil.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Job 1:2-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.  His
substance also was seven thousand sheep&hellip;  </p>

<p>He was a very rich man.  There are rich men in the Bible,
such as Abraham or Jacob, men who had a lot of flocks, or the kings of Israel. 
In their richness, they are pictures of Christ who owns all of the riches of
this world.  </p>

<p>So Job was a very rich man, and then we read in Job 1:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before JEHOVAH, and Satan came also among them. </p>

<p>This is before the time of the cross when Satan was actually
allowed in Heaven.  There are a couple of different passages in the Old
Testament concerning this.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Job 1:7-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
answered JEHOVAH, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from
walking up and down in it. And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my
servant Job, that <i>there is </i>none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered
JEHOVAH, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge
about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou
hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse
thee to thy face. And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is </i>in
thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from
the presence of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>We go on to read that all of Jobs flocks and herds were
taken from him.  His seven sons and his three daughters were eating and
drinking in the eldest son&rsquo;s house when the house collapsed.  The seven sons
were killed, but it does not say anything about the daughters.  </p>

<p>We read in Job 1:18-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">While he <i>was </i>yet speaking, there came also another, and
said, Thy sons and thy daughters <i>were </i>eating and drinking wine in their
eldest brother's house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the
wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young
men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  </p>

<p>So all of these things came upon Job, and then we read in
Job 1:20-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, And said, Naked came I out of my
mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: JEHOVAH gave, and JEHOVAH hath
taken away; blessed be the name of JEHOVAH. In all this Job sinned not, nor
charged God foolishly.</p>

<p>He remained perfectly faithful.  In this, Job is a picture
of Christ.  </p>

<p>So Satan comes before God again, and we read in Job 2:3-10: 
</p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
Job, that <i>there is </i>none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright
man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
And Satan answered JEHOVAH, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath
will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and
his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. And JEHOVAH said unto Satan,
Behold, he <i>is </i>in thine hand; but save his life. So went Satan forth from
the presence of JEHOVAH, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his
foot unto his crown. And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and
he sat down among the ashes. Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still
retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. But he said unto her, Thou speakest
as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand
of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his
lips.  </p>

<p>Again, Job remains perfectly faithful to God.  </p>

<p>Notice that the affliction of Job, who is a picture of
Christ, was in two stages.  First, God allowed Satan to take his flocks and his
herds from him, all of his wealth, as well as his sons.  Then Job&rsquo;s body was
physically afflicted.  There is spiritual significance in this.  </p>

<p>Then we read about Job&rsquo;s three friends who come to comfort
him, to console him, and yet they do not even begin to console him at all. 
They instead begin immediately to outright say to him that he has sinned
against God and that this is the reason for why God is afflicting him.  </p>

<p>If you look at the three names - Eliphaz the Temanite, and
Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite - you can find two of these names
in the genealogy of Esau.  Esau had a son named Eliphaz who had a son named
Teman.  This Eliphaz the Temanite was probably another generation or two down,
but we cannot say this for certain.  I do not remember which one; either Bildad
or Zophar, one of their lines was also among the sons that Abraham had by Keturah,
the woman whom Abraham took for a wife after Sarah died.  But, again, we do not
know exactly where in time this took place, so we cannot be certain about any
of this; but it looks like none of them were in the blessed line.  The blessed
line goes from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob, to Jacob&rsquo;s twelve sons.  The blessed
line is the line that the theologians call the line through which Christ came. 
</p>

<p>Although these men were blood descendants of Abraham, and
even though they were sons of Isaac, as Esau was a twin son of Jacob, God uses Edom
and Ammon and Moab as pictures.  He uses them in the Bible as pictures of the
church, of those in the church who are in rebellion.  He uses them as figures,
but we will not get into this right now.  </p>

<p>Then in Job 3:1-5, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. And Job
spake, and said, Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <i>in
which </i>it was said, There is a man child conceived. Let that day be
darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon
it. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it;
let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>

<p>Then we read in Job 3:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
therein. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their
mourning.  </p>

<p>The sense of this whole chapter is one of night and darkness
and the curse.  </p>

<p>What we are speaking of here is that Christ was under the
curse of God.  He became a curse for us.  This is a fundamental part of the
Gospel.  Christ became a curse for the elect.  </p>

<p>His friends begin to speak in Job 4.  Immediately, as I
said, they begin to find fault with Job.  Even though we cannot say this for
certain, these three men are probably a picture of those in the church who
cannot fully understand.  They do not fully understand Christ or exactly how
the Gospel works.  I am not saying that these men were saved or unsaved,
though.  In the end when God appeared, God was angry with these three friends
because they had gotten some things wrong about Job; but He told them that Job
would pray for them and to make sacrifices.  Somehow these men picture those in
the church who do not have full understanding.  </p>

<p>Then in Job 4, we find Eliphaz speaking.  He says to Job in
Job 4:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember, I pray thee, who <i>ever </i>perished, being innocent?
or where were the righteous cut off? Even as I have seen, they that plow
iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.  </p>

<p>Eliphaz is suggesting that Job sinned.  God is bringing
judgment against him for doing this.  </p>

<p>Look at Job 11.  This is Zophar speaking.  We read in Job
11:1-6:    </p>

<p class="verse">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, Should not the
multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? Should
thy lies make men hold their peace?&hellip; </p>

<p>They are already getting angry at Job.  They are offended
because Job is maintaining that he is righteous and that he would like to
reason with God and ask him why these things have been brought upon him.  This
is why these men are already getting angry at Job.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? For thou hast said, My doctrine <i>is </i>pure,
and I am clean in thine eyes. But oh that God would speak, and open his lips
against thee; And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that <i>they
are </i>double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee <i>less
</i>than thine iniquity <i>deserveth.</i>  </p>

<p>So these men are accusing Job of sin, and yet these guys say
some beautiful things.  They go on for about 20 chapters of Job saying a lot of
faithful and beautiful things.  </p>

<p>Look at what Zophar says here at the end of Job 11:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Know therefore that God exacteth of thee <i>less </i>than thine
iniquity <i>deserveth.</i>  </p>

<p>This is perfectly accurate when we speak of sinners who have
been saved.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 103.  We read in Psalm 103:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH <i>is </i>merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i>his anger
</i>for ever.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 103:10 now:  </p>

<p class="verse">He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 130:3, it says:</p>

<p class="verse">If thou, JEHOVAH, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand?  </p>

<p>If God kept tract of our individual sins, none of us could
stand; but the sins of a child of God have been wiped out.  </p>

<p>So here in Job 11:6, Zophar says something that is perfectly
faithful:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Know therefore that God exacteth of thee <i>less </i>than thine
iniquity <i>deserveth.</i>  </p>

<p>Turn to Job 22.  This is Messianic.  This is Eliphaz
speaking again.  We read in Job 22:1-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, Can a man be
profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?<i> Is
it </i>any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or <i>is it </i>gain
<i>to him, </i>that thou makest thy ways perfect? Will he reprove thee for fear
of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?<i> Is </i>not thy wickedness
great? and thine iniquities infinite? For thou hast taken a pledge from thy
brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. Thou hast not
given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the
hungry.  </p>

<p>Do you know what Eliphaz is speaking of here?  He is
speaking of our sins.  These sins were upon Christ as He paid for them.  Job,
however, continues to maintain that he is righteous.  </p>

<p>Turn back to Job 6.  Job is speaking to his three friends
and says in Job 6:22-24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
substance? Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of
the mighty? Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand
wherein I have erred.  </p>

<p>Job is still questioning why this judgment is on him.  </p>

<p>Look at Job 9.  Job says in Job 9:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
without cause.  </p>

<p>Or look at Job 10:1-8.  Job is still speaking:  </p>

<p class="verse">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. I will say unto God, Do not
condemn me; show me wherefore thou contendest with me.<i> Is it </i>good unto
thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine
hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? Hast thou eyes of flesh? or
seest thou as man seeth?<i> Are </i>thy days as the days of man? <i>are </i>thy
years as man's days, That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest
after my sin? Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and <i>there is </i>none that
can deliver out of thine hand. Thine hands have made me and fashioned me
together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.  </p>

<p>We read this also in Psalm 119:73:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy hands have made me and fashioned me&hellip;  </p>

<p>Job 10 is Messianic.  This is Christ speaking, but this just
offends Job&rsquo;s three friends.  </p>

<p>So in a couple of places, Job expresses his desire to talk
to God and to reason with Him, as we read in Job 13.  Job is speaking to his
three friends again and says in Job 13:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Lo, mine eye hath seen all <i>this, </i>mine ear hath heard and
understood it. What ye know, <i>the same </i>do I know also: I <i>am </i>not
inferior unto you. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
with God. But ye <i>are </i>forgers of lies, ye <i>are </i>all physicians of no
value.  </p>

<p>A physician in the Bible is someone who is supposed to heal
someone.  They should be bringing the true Gospel.  He is speaking of the
church here as &ldquo;physicians of no value.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Job 23.  We read in Job 23:1-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Job answered and said, Even to day <i>is </i>my complaint
bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. Oh that I knew where I might
find him! <i>that </i>I might come <i>even </i>to his seat! I would order <i>my
</i>cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. I would know the words <i>which
</i>he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. Will he plead
against me with <i>his </i>great power? No; but he would put <i>strength </i>in
me. There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for
ever from my judge. Behold, I go forward, but he <i>is </i>not <i>there; </i>and
backward, but I cannot perceive him:  </p>

<p>Job is frustrated that he cannot speak to God, that God is
not there.  He desires to reason with God.  </p>

<p>Look at Job 16.  They are getting angry with each other.  He
is speaking back to his three friends in Job 16.  We read in Job 16:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things:
miserable comforters <i>are </i>ye all.  </p>

<p>Look at what we read in Psalm 35.  This is also Messianic. 
We read in Psalm 35:11-15:  </p>

<p class="verse">False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <i>things </i>that
I knew not. They rewarded me evil for good <i>to </i>the spoiling of my soul. But
as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <i>was </i>sackcloth: I humbled my
soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. I behaved myself
as though <i>he had been </i>my friend <i>or </i>brother: I bowed down heavily,
as one that mourneth <i>for his </i>mother. But in mine adversity they
rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <i>yea, </i>the abjects gathered
themselves together against me, and I knew <i>it </i>not; they did tear <i>me, </i>and
ceased not:  </p>

<p>This is Messianic.  This is Christ speaking here of how He
had compassion, especially when His church fell so far away and sinned and turned
to idols.  They were sick and He was grieved by this.  </p>

<p>So Job is telling his friends: &ldquo;miserable comforters <i>are </i>ye
all.&rdquo;  The church is not like Christ.  They are not grieved with the sins of
their loved ones or with the sins of the world around them, and they were not
really doing the work of God in loving their neighbor by bringing them the true
Gospel.  </p>

<p>This exchange goes on until chapter 32; then Elihu comes on
the scene.  We will not speak about him right now, but he says a couple of
things that suggest that he himself is God.  For example, we read in Job
33:3-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">My words <i>shall be of </i>the uprightness of my heart: and my
lips shall utter knowledge clearly. The spirit of God hath made me, and the
breath of the Almighty hath given me life.  </p>

<p>He says some other things that suggest that he has perfect
understanding.  </p>

<p>But after Elihu is done speaking, then God appears in Job
38.  We read in Job 38:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then JEHOVAH answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who <i>is
</i>this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy
loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.  </p>

<p>He is speaking to Job.  Remember that Job is a human being. 
Job is a figure of Christ, but he is also human and he has some things wrong
himself.  God is now reproving Job and says to him in Job 38:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Gird up now thy loins like a man&hellip;  </p>

<p>When we read this expression of girding up one&rsquo;s loins, the
sense of this expression is, &ldquo;Let us get down to work!&rdquo;  But we know that the
girdle of his loins is righteousness, because this also has spiritual
applications.  This is what the sense is when we read of someone girding up
their loins.  They are going to work.   </p>

<p>Then He says again in Job 38:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who <i>is </i>this that darkeneth counsel by words without
knowledge?  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Counsel&rdquo; in the Bible refers to the Word of God.  God tells
Job that He is darkening it &ldquo;by words without knowledge.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God goes on next to talk about His glory and who He is.  He
says in Job 38:4-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if
thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the
foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the
morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Or <i>who
</i>shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, <i>as if </i>it had issued
out of the womb? When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
a swaddlingband for it,  </p>

<p>He goes on for two chapters speaking like this.  </p>

<p>In Job 39:1-2, He is still talking to Job.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
forth? <i>or </i>canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? Canst thou number the
months <i>that </i>they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
</p>

<p>Let us go back to Job 38.  I want to read something in that
chapter.  We read in Job 38:22-28:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
seen the treasures of the hail, Which I have reserved against the time of
trouble, against the day of battle and war? By what way is the light parted, <i>which
</i>scattereth the east wind upon the earth? Who hath divided a watercourse for
the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; To cause it
to rain on the earth, <i>where </i>no man <i>is; on </i>the wilderness, wherein
<i>there is </i>no man; To satisfy the desolate and waste <i>ground; </i>and to
cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? Hath the rain a father? or
who hath begotten the drops of dew?  </p>

<p>I remember something that still sticks with me today. 
Around twenty years ago, someone was doing a Bible study on the Gospel and the
creation.  I believe that they cited this.  Then He basically said, &ldquo;When you
complain about the weather, you are cursing God; because it is God who makes
the very weather.&rdquo;  We have to glorify God in everything.  This stuck with me
all of these years.  </p>

<p>Let us go to back to Job 40 now and I will finish this.  I
just wanted to speak about this passage in Job 40.  We read in Job 40:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover JEHOVAH answered Job, and said, Shall he that
contendeth with the Almighty instruct <i>him?&hellip; </i></p>

<p>In other words, God is asking Job, &ldquo;Are you going to
instruct Me?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he that reproveth [<i>or correcteth</i>] God, let him answer
it. Then Job answered JEHOVAH, and said, Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer
thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.  </p>

<p>We read in numerous places in the Bible of men who were
confronted by God.  They suddenly just dropped to their knees.  When Peter saw
the Lord work that miracle with the fish, we read that he &ldquo;fell down at Jesus'
knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&rdquo;  When God
appeared to Daniel, we read that Daniel &ldquo;fainted, and was sick <i>certain </i>days.&rdquo; 
When Abraham was pleading to God for Sodom if there had been anyone righteous
in the city, we read in Genesis 18:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the Lord, which <i>am but </i>dust and ashes:  </p>

<p>This is the attitude of men in the Bible when they are
confronted with the Lord Himself.  In our humility and in our contrition, we
are crushed.  </p>

<p>Returning to Job 40, we read where Job says in Job 40:4-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but
I will proceed no further. Then answered JEHOVAH unto Job out of the whirlwind,
and said, Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare
thou unto me.  </p>

<p>In other words, God is saying that He is going to ask Job
some questions and Job is to give Him some answers.  God says in Job 40:8-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that
thou mayest be righteous? Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with
a voice like him? Deck thyself now <i>with </i>majesty and excellency; and
array thyself with glory and beauty. Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and
behold every one <i>that is </i>proud, and abase him. Look on every one <i>that
is </i>proud, <i>and </i>bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their
place. Hide them in the dust together; <i>and </i>bind their faces in secret.  
</p>

<p>In other words, if Job could do all of these things, God
says to him in Job 40:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee.  </p>

<p>We do absolutely nothing in salvation.  We are dead.  We are
raised to life by the mercy of God and by His sovereign grace, but God is
saying here to Job in Job 40:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hast thou an arm like God?&hellip; </p>

<p>In the Bible, the arm speaks of strength as well as the
will; and God is asking Job, &ldquo;Do you have an arm like God?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look a Psalm 44.  We read in Psalm 44:1-3:  </p>

<p class="verse">We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, <i>what
</i>work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.<i> How </i>thou didst
drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; <i>how </i>thou didst
afflict the people, and cast them out. For they got not the land in possession
by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand,
and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour
unto them.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of salvation being entirely by the will of
God, by the strength of God in Jesus Christ, and by the &ldquo;light of thy
countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.&rdquo;  They were named by God.  His
favor was upon them from before the foundations of the world.  He says here
that this is &ldquo;but (<i>by</i>) thy right hand.&rdquo;  In Psalm 80, it defines Christ
as &ldquo;the man of thy right hand.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So again back in Job 40:9, God is speaking and says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
like him?  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to say that if Job could do all of these
things that He can do, Job 40:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee.  </p>

<p>This is utterly impossible for man as this speaks to the
majesty and the glory of God, to His mercy and His sovereign grace in
salvation.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  This is a difficult book, but maybe we
will be able to do more studies in this book, Lord willing.  </p>

<p><i>Father in Heaven, we come to You and say could it be that
we have expounded correctly on what we have looked at in the book of Job here
tonight.  If we have seen what You have intended for man to see in this Book,
this is only by Your mercy.  We thank You for this and we thank You that You
have given mankind this Book, a Book that is not like any book on earth.  This
Book came from You.  When we sit and ponder the things in this Book, we are
sitting at Your feet.  We just thank You for Your glory and for Your majesty. 
We thank You for our very lives.  Our breath is in Your hands.  We only have
our physical life because of You.  Could it be that we would simply want to
glorify You until that Day and talk of all of Your wondrous works.  We pray
this in Jesus Name.  Amen.  </i></p>
