<p>Tonight I would like to take a look at Matthew 16. 
Actually, we are just going to start here, and then we will go to some other
verses.  To begin with, let us go to Matthew 16 and I will read from verse 5. 
It says in Matthew 16:5-12:   </p>

<p class="verse">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
forgotten to take bread. Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. And they reasoned among
themselves, saying, <i>It is </i>because we have taken no bread.<i> Which </i>when
Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among
yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? Do ye not yet understand, neither
remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
How is it that ye do not understand that I spake <i>it </i>not to you
concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of
the Sadducees? Then understood they how that he bade <i>them </i>not beware of
the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 
</p>

<p>I will stop reading there.  </p>

<p>This is really a rather incidental account between Christ
and His disciples.  They are traveling, they come to the other side, and, oops,
they forgot to bring bread, as it said in verse 5.  Then Jesus said in verse 6,
Matthew 16:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the
Sadducees.  </p>

<p>Then we read of the disciples reasoning among themselves.  </p>

<p>Who are these men?  Most of them are true believers.  Most
of them are saved men.  We know that Judas was not; but as far as the other
eleven, we would gather that they were saved men.  These men are trying to
figure out what Christ is saying to them, but it is not always that easy and it
is not always that simple.  </p>

<p>Some people have the idea that the Bible is a simple book.  It
is simple, if all one reads is John 3:16.  If all someone thinks the Bible is
about is, &ldquo;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,&rdquo;
then that is enough.  What else does someone really need to know then?  </p>

<p>There are a lot of churches out there that pretty much stay
on this level.  They do not go very much beyond this.  They try to keep it very
simple.  They think that the Bible is simple: we are sinners; God has provided
salvation in Christ; John 3:16 says that He loves everybody.  It is only a
matter then as to whether or not an individual is going to accept Him, if an
individual is going to be someone who chooses Christ.  </p>

<p>Right there what has happened is that the complex book of
the Bible has just confounded tons of Christians with this one simple verse,
&ldquo;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.&rdquo;  Their
understanding of this, because they think that this is so simple, is wrong. 
But this is just the nature of the Bible.  It is not a simple book.  It is the
most complex book that there is.  </p>

<p>If a person goes to law school, they have to do a lot of
studying of law books.  But law books are not more complex than the Bible. 
Medical books are not more complex than the Bible.  Scientific books are not
more complex than the Bible.  All of those books, as well as anything else that
the world can gather together, are not more complex than the Bible.  The Bible
is the world&rsquo;s most difficult book to understand.  This is because the Bible is
impossible to understand.  </p>

<p>If someone were to put enough time into it, most people
would probably be able to understand certain things concerning the law or
medicine or science or math, or whatever.  If they are diligent and just put a
lot of time into study, eventually they are going to begin to learn some
things.  </p>

<p>Well, you can put tons of time into studying the Bible; but
if God does not want you to know something, you are going to walk away with
zero knowledge.  Really, when you get down to it, you are not going to know
much at all of the Bible.  </p>

<p>This is because the Bible was written by God.  This is the
simple answer.  Who writes the law books?  Men do.  Who writes the medical
books?  Men do.  Who wrote the Bible?  God did.  </p>

<p>In Isaiah 55, there is a verse that kind of puts us all in
our place if we ever think that we are somebody.  In Isaiah 55, it says in
Isaiah 55:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For my thoughts <i>are </i>not your thoughts, neither <i>are </i>your
ways my ways, saith JEHOVAH. For <i>as </i>the heavens are higher than the
earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.  </p>

<p>So here is the comparison.  When you look out at the stars
at night, how high are they?  How much higher than the earth are they?  NASA
could launch a rocket and the people would die before the rocket ever reached
one of those distant stars.  The heavens are so much higher than the earth, and
God is saying that this is the comparison between His thoughts and our
thoughts.  </p>

<p>We are just little tiny creatures.  This is all that we
are.  The best, the greatest, and the most brilliant, well, they are the most
brilliant of the most little tiny creatures.  Some can be more advanced than
others, yes; there are brilliant scientists.  But once we compare that man to
God, he does not know anything.  </p>

<p>God, by His wisdom, has made fools of the brilliant people
of this earth, as He has allowed them to come up with a teaching like
evolution.  They think that they have it all figured out when they really do
not.  They do not know anything as they ought.  </p>

<p>The problem with the Bible, and it is everyone&rsquo;s problem and
has been a constant problem all through time and a major problem today, is how
we are to understand it.  How do we understand the Bible?  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Matthew 16.  In Matthew 16, they forgot to
take bread.  Then we read that Jesus says in Matthew 16:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>

<p>What are the disciples thinking?  They reason among
themselves, and then they say in Matthew 16:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>It is </i>because we have taken no bread.  </p>

<p>Maybe they are thinking that Jesus said this to warn them
about the bread that a Pharisee or a Sadducee might give to them.  Maybe it
would be defiled.  Maybe it would be poisoned.  After all, there is conflict
between the rulers of Israel and the Lord Jesus and His disciples; and so they
are wondering and reasoning among themselves.  </p>

<p>Again, most of them are saved people.  But where do their
minds go?  Right away, where do their minds go?  What is the first thing that
these saved men think of?  What level of thinking are they on and what level
should they be on?  </p>

<p>They are thinking on an earthly level and they are on a
natural level.  They forgot to take bread.  Jesus is talking about leaven.  Naturally,
it must have had to do with bread.  Then they are told that they have to beware
of the Pharisees and the Sadducees should they provide any bread.  </p>

<p>No; this was wrong.  This was a very wrong understanding
that they had, even though this statement was made in a way that was plain,
literal, and straightforward.  This is what Jesus said.  This whole conversation
and discussion was about bread.  </p>

<p>So here we see the disciples following an understanding that
the theologians of our day have.  They are following the methodology that the
churches teach.  Countless Christians just look for the plain literal sense of
the Word of God.  </p>

<p>Christ is the Word made flesh, and so where does this get
them?  When they do this, when they follow this hermeneutic, when they follow the
teaching of just understanding the Words of Christ on a basic and simple level
and they do not look for any other meaning, where does this get them?  They are
lost.  They have no real understanding of what He was saying at all.  </p>

<p>It goes on to say in verse 8, Matthew 16:8-11:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Which </i>when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of
little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Neither the seven loaves of the four
thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? How is it that ye do not
understand&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why do they not understand?  </p>

<p>What does the Bible tell us in Romans 3?  We read in Romans
3:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
after God.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s perspective of all mankind.  There are a zero
number of people who understand Him.  There are a zero number of people who
understand the Word of God.  </p>

<p>If He just left the situation as it is &ndash; He is infinite eternal
God and His Word is brilliant, while we are little tiny finite man with our
minds &ndash; and He did not do anything to assist us, none would understand. 
Nobody.  Nobody would understand at all.  </p>

<p>Of course, we know that God does not leave things there.  We
know that He does help us, but there are more problems that we will see in
Isaiah 45.  Not only naturally does no human being understand the Bible, not
only this, but God says of Himself in Isaiah 45:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily thou <i>art </i>a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
the Saviour.  </p>

<p>He would not even have to hide Himself, and yet He says that
He does.  This is why, for instance, in the Proverbs, God speaks of searching
for wisdom &ldquo;as <i>for </i>hid treasures.&rdquo;  We have to dig, like one would dig
for gold or silver, because it is hidden.  Truth is buried on the pages of the
Bible.  In order to find spiritual riches, spiritual treasure, we need to dig;
and God tells us how to do this digging in other places in the Bible.  But He
has hidden truth from man.  </p>

<p>We read in Matthew 13 that Christ spoke in parables.  It
says, &ldquo;Without a parable spake he not unto them.&rdquo;  So have you ever wondered
about this or asked yourself why Christ spoke in parables?  Why?  Why is it
that &ldquo;without a parable spake he not unto them&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>Was it because He wanted to tell us a nice story to help us
to understand something?  Is this really the case?  There are some parables that
two thousand years later we still do not understand.  Would it not have been
much easier and much plainer for Christ to have directly said, &ldquo;Beware of the
teaching and of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo;?  </p>

<p>They would have understood this right away; but He said,
&ldquo;Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.&rdquo;  He used a figure
of speech.  He used something to represent something else.  This is what
parables do.  </p>

<p>You would think that we would have figured out that Christ
spoke in parables and that He was the Word made flesh in order to teach us that
this was how God wrote the Bible.  This is why without a parable He did not
speak.  He was trying to instruct us that He spoke in parables and that what we
would have to do in order to understand anything in this Bible is to look at
the whole Bible like a parabolic statement.  </p>

<p>We are going to have to search for truth.  We cannot be
lazy.  We cannot go to the Bible and expect an understanding to be right there,
like &ldquo;of that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth no man.&rdquo;  This is a lazy man&rsquo;s
understanding to say, &ldquo;Well, there it is right in Mark 13:32!&rdquo;  These were the verses that we used to discuss on a daily basis.  We have gotten away from
them over the last month.  </p>

<p>But the problem that the churches had and still have is that
this is lazy, superficial, and casual, because it is just skimming the
surface.  God will always resist those who do not &ldquo;study to show thyself
approved unto God,&rdquo; those who do not dig into the Word, those who do not search
the Scriptures to see if it is so.  </p>

<p>I think it is very rare and I do not know if I can think of
a single instance where we can just go to one verse, read it, and have a whole
doctrine figured out.  I do not think that this is possible to do with the
Bible.  The way that God has written the Bible is that we must compare
Scripture with Scripture, &ldquo;here a little, <i>and </i>there a little,&rdquo; and then
we are able to come to truth.  </p>

<p>Here in Matthew 13, we read in Matthew 13:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. And the disciples came, and
said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said
unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a reference to the true believers.  </p>

<p>Then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but to them it is not given.     </p>

<p>This is referring to the unbelievers, to those whom God
never had a plan to save.  </p>

<p>It continues in Matthew 13:12-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that
he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not;
and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.  </p>

<p>Again, we see a lack of understanding or ignorance.  The
Bible tells us that &ldquo;a wise man's heart discerneth [<i>or understands</i>] both
time and judgment.&rdquo;  By the way, is this still true?  Of course this is true. 
&ldquo;A wise man&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; which is referring to a child of God, &ldquo;discerneth both
time and judgment.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, we blew this with May 21, right?  No; no.  What was
May 21?  It was Judgment Day.  It was the day that God closed the door to
Heaven.  It was the day that He judged mankind; and so we understood the time
and the judgment.  We knew this.  We had this correct.  What we had wrong was
we thought that there would be a great earthquake.  </p>

<p>Let us look at these two events, a major worldwide
earthquake and the shutting of the door to Heaven.  God is no longer saving
because Christ is the Door and He is the only way into Heaven.  The only way to
experience eternal life is through Christ.  When this Door shut, which it did
on May 21, this happened on the spiritual level.  No one could see this.  </p>

<p>If you remember, Jesus gives us an example of a man who was
sick of the palsy.  He said to him, &ldquo;Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo;  Then
some of the Pharisees reasoned in their hearts, &ldquo;Who can forgive sins but God
only?&rdquo;  Jesus knew that they had thought this and said to them, &ldquo;Whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy, <i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven thee; or to
say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>What was easier for Christ?  What was easier for God to do? 
It is incredibly more easy for Christ to say, &ldquo;Arise, and take up thy bed, and
walk.&rdquo;  He is God.  He can speak and bring a universe into being.  He can make
the deaf to hear and the blind to see &ndash; Jesus demonstrated these things
repeatedly &ndash; and He could make the man sick of the palsy to walk.  This did not
take hardly any effort, but to say, &ldquo;<i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven thee,&rdquo; He had
to die for that man&rsquo;s sins.  He had to pay the penalty before the foundation of
the world and experience the wrath of God for his sins.  Of course, it was much
more difficult for Him to say, &ldquo;<i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But this was a spiritual thing.  To the outward observers,
nothing happened.  This man was still in his bed.  Then Jesus said, &ldquo;But that
ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith
to the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed,&rdquo; which
he did.  </p>

<p>So they saw the physical aspect of his healing, which was a
minor thing.  This was very minor compared to the spiritual salvation of God
saving him and giving him a new heart and a new spirit.  </p>

<p>If a physical earthquake had taken place on May 21 but the
door to Heaven was still open, would that have been worse?  This would not have
been worse.  This would not have been worse at all, because at least the people
in the world could still have the hope of salvation.  </p>

<p>God did the far worse thing.  He shut the door, which was a
spiritual occurrence, a spiritual happening that no one could see; but it was a
very real thing as He shut the door to salvation.  After saving all of His
sheep, after saving the last of His elect, then He shut the door.  </p>

<p>Since this was a spiritual act of God and since man could
not see this, they do not believe it.  As far as they are concerned, nothing
happened, nothing happened at all.  But this is not true.  </p>

<p>This is no more true than in the Garden of Eden when God
said, &ldquo;In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&rdquo;  We just saw
in Kevin&rsquo;s study that the serpent was denying this, &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die: For
God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So Eve sins and is deceived and gives to Adam and they
partake of the fruit.  Did they fall down dead right on the spot?  No; they did
not.  To outward eyes &ndash; and at this point Adam and Eve only had outward eyes &ndash;
the devil or the serpent seemed to be right.  They did not fall down dead.  </p>

<p>But God did not lie.  God told the truth, &ldquo;In the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&rdquo;; and on that very day, they died in
their soul spiritually.  Ever since, men are born into the world and they are
conceived in sin.  The Bible says, &ldquo;Who can bring a clean <i>thing </i>out of
an unclean? not one.&rdquo;  This means that everyone is born in trespasses and sins
and has a spiritually dead heart.  God told the truth.  When Adam was 930 years
old, he did physically die, but he did not physically in that day.  </p>

<p>The thing is that we read the Bible and we thought that May
21 would be Judgment Day, that the door would shut, that there would be no more
salvation, and that there would be a great earthquake.  Even when we shared
these things, we should have minimized the earthquake.  As people asked us
about this, we should have minimized the earthquake and we should concentrated
more on what they really had to worry about, which was that Heaven&rsquo;s gate would
shut and that there would be no more salvation on May 21.  </p>

<p>This is the thing that we really should have emphasized and
stressed.  We did, but we should have done this more.  Whenever a question on
the physical happenings came around, we should have changed the discussion to a
focus on no more salvation; but we did not.  We misunderstood certain aspects
of God&rsquo;s plan.  </p>

<p>Are we not supposed to feel ashamed of ourselves?  No; I do
not.  Should we not feel guilty?  No; I do not, not in the slightest bit.  In
all good conscience, and this is what I think that God&rsquo;s people did, in all
good conscience, we shared this information because it was the absolute truth,
but we were wrong on a few details.  </p>

<p>Tell me who has never been wrong on a few details.  What
about the disciples?  They were right there with Jesus.  Jesus was talking to
them about leaven and they completely misunderstood.  </p>

<p>So when we look at the Bible for what it is in reality, we
see that it is the most complex and difficult book known to man.  This is true
because God was the One who wrote it.  </p>

<p>Look at 1 Corinthians 2.  It says in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11: 
</p>

<p class="verse">But God hath revealed <i>them </i>unto us by his Spirit: for the
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  For what man knoweth
the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?&hellip; </p>

<p>If I really want to get to know someone, I will start
talking to them.  Over a course of time, I will ask them questions and they
will give me answers.  This can happen with one of our neighbors.  Over the
course of years, we can try to find out things about one of our neighbors or
one of our friends.  We go back and forth and we learn things about that
individual.  </p>

<p>One day something happens that you hear about often.  You
look on the news and there is your neighbor.  He just killed two people in the
most horrible way.  Then the news crew comes to your house, because you are one
of his neighbors, and they ask, &ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo;  You tell them, &ldquo;Oh, he was
a nice guy.  He was the last person who I would ever think would do something
like that.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Why did you think this?  You thought this because no one
knows what is going on inside of another individual.  You may think that you
do, for example, with your wife or with your children or even with your
neighbor.  Maybe you think that you know someone inside and out.  But guess
what?  You do not.  You do not, because within each individual there can be
things that they are hiding.  Only that individual himself or herself really
knows themselves better than anyone else, even though they do not even know
themselves as they should really and as God knows them.  God can search the
deep things within man.  He can search the heart of man.  </p>

<p>But here is what God is saying.  Who knows a man or who
knows you better than yourself?  You have all of your own history.  You know
what you think.  You know what you like.  You pretty much know everything about
yourself that you can remember.  This is because no one knows you like you do. 
This is for sure.  Your wife or your husband does not really know you like you
know yourself.  </p>

<p>So God is using this fact and continues on to say in 1
Corinthians 2:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
</p>

<p>The &ldquo;things of God&rdquo; are the Bible.  The Bible is from the
mouth of God.  It is the Word of God.  </p>

<p>At the end of 1 Corinthians 2, we read in 1 Corinthians
2:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
him? But we have the mind of Christ.  </p>

<p>Yes; along with a new heart and a new spirit, we can also
say that we have the &ldquo;mind of Christ&rdquo;; but this also applies when we pick up
this book, because the Bible is a reflection of the infinite mind of Christ,
the mind of God.  But who knows this?  Who knows the mind of God?  </p>

<p>I mean, if we cannot know each other, if we struggle after
years and years of thinking that we know someone and then that person just does
things and behaves in a way that we never would have guessed, if we cannot even
know another creature all that well and if we really do not even know ourselves
completely, how are we ever going to know the Bible?  How are we ever going to
understand the Bible?  </p>

<p>Only God understands the Bible.  The Spirit of God is the
One who understands the Bible.  This is why we need the Spirit of God in order
to come to any kind of understanding, because &ldquo;there is none that
understandeth.&rdquo;  This is where we all begin.  &ldquo;No, not one&rdquo;; not one of us
understands.  </p>

<p>But if God saves us, if He gives us His Spirit, since it is
His Spirit who wrote the Bible and who knows about the Bible, then possibly we
will learn truth; but still even then, the disciples have reminded us that we
are not going to know things perfectly.  We are not going to know everything
that we would like.  </p>

<p>Let us take a look at a few more verses.  Let us go to 1
Corinthians 10.  I will just read the first few verses.  It says in 1
Corinthians 10:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant&hellip;  </p>

<p>This means to lack understanding.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And
did all eat the same spiritual meat; And did all drink the same spiritual
drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock
was Christ.  </p>

<p>I must have missed something back in Exodus and Numbers.  I
do not remember reading about them eating &ldquo;spiritual meat&rdquo; and drinking
&ldquo;spiritual drink,&rdquo; and I do not remember a rock chasing after them.  Does
anyone remember reading about this in the historical books of the Bible?  No;
because God did not write them in this way.  How did He write them?  He wrote
them like history, plain old history.  </p>

<p>They came out of Egypt, they went into the wilderness, they
experienced hunger and thirst, they murmured all about it, and then God would
provide.  He would have manna fall from Heaven.  He had Moses strike the rock
and water was provided.  </p>

<p>But nowhere there does it mention anything about &ldquo;spiritual
meat&hellip;spiritual drink&hellip;spiritual Rock.&rdquo;  No where; and yet here we come to the
New Testament and God is just matter-of-factly describing this history and He is
saying that this was spiritual, which means that these things represented things
all about the Gospel.  They represented things that were related to Christ and
to the salvation plan of God.  </p>

<p>Turn to Galatians 4.  I will start reading in verse 21.  It
says in Galatians 4:21:  </p>

<p class="verse">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
law?  </p>

<p>This is a reference to the law.  We will see as we continue
to read that this is talking about historical events in the book of Genesis,
which is part of the first five books of the Bible or what is known as the Pentateuch. 
The Pentateuch is known as the law.  Actually, the truth is that the whole
Bible is the law.  Everything in the Bible is the law of God, but it is
interesting that God asks:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;do ye not hear the law?  </p>

<p>This is like when Jesus would give a parable and then He
would say, &ldquo;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;  This is just a reference
to history, and yet He asks, &ldquo;Do ye not hear?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Well, what do we have to hear when God is just writing about
history?  Are we supposed to just learn these historical events and their times
and their happenings and what took place?  </p>

<p>No; if we go to God and we remember that Christ spoke in
parables and that by doing this He was trying to teach us how to understand the
whole Bible, then we will understand why these verses are here in Galatians 4. 
</p>

<p>We read next in Galatians 4:22-29:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. But he <i>who was </i>of the bondwoman was
born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman <i>was </i>by promise. Which
things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount
Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai
in Arabia, and answereth [<i>corresponds</i>] to Jerusalem which now is, and is
in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is
the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, <i>thou </i>barren that
bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate
hath many more children than she which hath an husband. Now we, brethren, as
Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then he that was born after the
flesh persecuted him <i>that was born </i>after the Spirit, even so <i>it is </i>now. 
</p>

<p>Well, again, God asks, &ldquo;Do ye not hear the law?&rdquo;  We could
go back to Genesis and we could find these events taking place.  In some of the
earlier chapters of Genesis, we read where Abram (Abraham) got into trouble. 
He listened to Sarai (Sarah) and she gave him her handmaid Hagar (Agar) to have
a baby because they were doubting God.  Then Ishmael was born through Hagar.  Later,
Isaac was born of Sarah and he was the child of the promise.  </p>

<p>All of these events are recorded in Genesis and there is not
one peep that indicates in those accounts that they were an allegory.  They
were true history, but God is telling us to listen because these things &ldquo;are an
allegory&rdquo; and that those two women represent two covenants.  </p>

<p>It is really incredible because He is talking about the free
woman and the one who is &ldquo;in bondage with her children.&rdquo;  This is Agar who corresponds
to Mount Sinai in Arabia where the law was given, plus Agar was an Egyptian and
  Israel was in bondage under Egyptian rule for hundreds of years.  She
represents the law.  Sarah represents the free woman, and so she represents
God&rsquo;s grace.  Isaac is born through her.  But we do not read any of this in the
book of Genesis.  </p>

<p>So if we take 1 Corinthians 10, which talked about the rock
and spiritual meat and spiritual drink, and we take this passage from Galatians
4 and then go back to Genesis and Exodus, we can mark all of those passages. 
Mark them all and you are going to have quite a lot of Scripture that you can
look at.  The churches will allow this.  According to the churches, it is only
then that, if you want, you can look for the deeper spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>Turn now to Hebrews 11 where we read of Abraham offering up
Isaac.  We read in Hebrews 11:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son.</i>  </p>

<p>Here is a hint.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 11:18-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: Accounting
that God <i>was </i>able to raise <i>him </i>up, even from the dead; from
whence also he received him in a figure.  </p>

<p>What is the word &ldquo;figure&rdquo; here for?  The reason is because
this is referring to a type or a figure of something.  Another way of saying this
is that this is an allegory or a parable or that it has a spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>So this is another one of these types of statements.  This
means that the whole instance where God tells Abraham to gather his son Isaac,
take him up to Mount Moriah, and to offer him as a sacrifice is a picture of
God the Father offering the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>You can also mark over this whole passage.  When you go
through the New Testament and you do this, you are going to see, not just
individual verses, but chapter after chapter where God Himself is trying to
encourage us as much as possible that this is how we have to understand the
Bible.  We must look for the spiritual meaning.  We cannot just settle on a
historical account, like the church is so willing to do today.  </p>

<p>The churches use the grammatical/historical method of
interpreting the Bible where they learn all they can about the history of that
day and the structure of the sentences.  But where is the Gospel?  It is there,
but they do not want to go into it.  </p>

<p>What they would have to allow, and they do, is they say that
as long as the New Testament interprets the Old, then it is okay to do this
allegorizing.  But then they say that if the Bible does not already interpret
something, then people had better not do this.  </p>

<p>So, for example, let us say that we are in Genesis 16 and we
have found references to things in this chapter like we just did elsewhere. 
Then we look for the Gospel and the spiritual meaning.  But what if we go to
the next chapter and we do not find anything in the New Testament that
references to it?  They would skip trying to find the spiritual meaning of that
chapter and just understand it in the historical/grammatical way until they get
to another chapter that has another New Testament reference that will help them
to dig into it.  </p>

<p>Do you see how ridiculous this is?  They are cutting up the
Bible.  Why not understand it as God wrote it, which is that He gives us
example after example after example, telling us that these things have a
spiritual meaning, that this is an allegory, that this is a figure, that this is
a type, etc?  Why not, along with Christ speaking in nothing but parables, why
not understand that this is the way that we must come to all Scripture, to the
whole Bible?  </p>

<p>If someone just reads one verse or a passage or a chapter
and all that they understand is what happened in maybe 7 B.C., if this is all
that they understand and nothing else, then they have not understood it.  You
and I and all of us need to find the deeper spiritual meaning.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to one verse in Deuteronomy 25.  We read in
Deuteronomy 25:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out <i>the corn.</i> 
</p>

<p>Do you hear the law?  Remember what we read in Galatians, &ldquo;Do
ye not hear the law?&rdquo;  This is when God was referring back to a historical
passage.  </p>

<p>We can say that this is the law.  Everybody knows that the
book of Deuteronomy gives law after law.  So here is the law:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out <i>the corn.</i> 
</p>

<p>This is the law of God.  Why did God write this?  Is He
concerned about animals?  Is He just giving a good guideline to farmers?  Why
did God really write this?  After all, this is the Bible.  This is the Word of
God, so why did He write this?  </p>

<p>Let us go to 1 Corinthians 9.  It says in 1 Corinthians
9:7-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a
vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and
eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I these things as a man? or saith not
the law the same also?  </p>

<p>So here is a reference to the law.  </p>

<p>Then we read in the next verse, 1 Corinthians 9:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the
mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is almost word-for-word.  Then we read:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Doth God take care for oxen?</p>

<p>This is the question.  Let us put this the way that we might
say it.  Does God care about that stupid animal?  Well, of course He does.  But
does God care in a way that this is a pressing matter to Him that an ox not be
muzzled?  </p>

<p>He does not care about this.  How many oxen have come and
gone over the centuries?  He is concerned about the souls of men.  He is
concerned about those created in His image.  The animals have a much secondary
place.  He did not write the law for the ox.  He wrote it for us.  </p>

<p>Now look at verse 10, 1 Corinthians 9:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Or saith he <i>it </i>altogether for our sakes? For our sakes,
no doubt, <i>this </i>is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and
that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.  </p>

<p>We do not have time to get into this, but He is going to
relate this to the ministry, to individuals who would be busy in treading out
the corn of the Gospel, like an ox, and they should not be muzzled.  </p>

<p>Throughout church history, it has always been understood
that the pastor was to be taken care of.  The minister of the congregation was
to be taken care of.  This was so he did not have to work a secular job in
order to have time to just dig into the Bible.  </p>

<p>This is why God wrote this verse in Deuteronomy 25, but this
is just a small example.  This is just one verse.  If you read the book of
Deuteronomy, you will find verse after verse like this one, law after law like
this one, where you would have to ask the same question.  For example, does God
care if there are two kinds of fabric in a garment?  Does He really care about
this, or is He telling us something about the Gospel?  In every case, he is, of
course, telling us about the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
