<p>One thing that I would like to talk about today is that the
Bible has a lot to say about the wicked.  It is in our nature to be wicked. 
None of us are righteous.  The righteousness that God demands from us, none of
us have.  Not one of us can do things God&rsquo;s way perfectly.  </p>

<p>So as we look in the Bible, God describes all of us.  It
makes no difference who you are or where you are from, your education or your
family heritage.  It has nothing to do with these things.  </p>

<p>If we look at Psalm 58, here God is describing all of us.  For
us to honestly see ourselves, we have to read the Bible.  God tells us exactly
what we are, and many people are offended when the Bible tells them that they
are sinners and that they are wicked.  God is speaking about all of us; and yet
for some people, from the moment that they see the term &ldquo;wicked,&rdquo; they think
about a murderer or about someone who did some horrible act.  They then tend to
think, &ldquo;Oh, this is not talking about me, because I am a good person.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Did someone ever tell you this, that you are a &ldquo;good person&rdquo;? 
No, we are not, not according to the Bible.  We can see the milk of human
kindness in people and how they help their fellowman; but according to the
Bible, we are not good.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 58, God&rsquo;s Word is telling you and me what we really
are.  We read in Psalm 58:1-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
uprightly, O ye sons of men? Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the
violence of your hands in the earth. The wicked are estranged from the womb:
they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. Their poison <i>is </i>like
the poison of a serpent: <i>they are </i>like the deaf adder <i>that </i>stoppeth
her ear; Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so
wisely. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of
the young lions, O JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s description of all of us.  As we come into
this world, God says that we are wicked from the womb.  We are born &ldquo;speaking
lies.&rdquo;  This is God&rsquo;s description of every single one of us and it is not
pretty.  </p>

<p>Does a newborn baby speak?  Of course not; but as God is
looking at the heart of a child, what does He see?  He sees a rebellious heart,
a wicked person.  </p>

<p>So God&rsquo;s description of every single one of us is that we
are wicked.  We are wicked people and we deserve to be destroyed by God
forevermore because we were made in the image of God.  God made us perfectly
and we rebelled against Him.  It is our nature to be wicked.  </p>

<p>For instance, look at Ephesians 2:3.  This is our nature,
which only God can change.  The only way that we can become righteous in God&rsquo;s
eyes is when God gives us a new heart.  In Ephesians 2:3, God is speaking about
what we were before we were saved.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the
lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and
were by nature&hellip;  </p>

<p>So this is our nature.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.  </p>

<p>It is our nature to be wicked and we, of ourselves, cannot
change this.  Maybe my sin is not as outward as someone else&rsquo;s, but what is
going on within my heart?  A sin that I am committing in thought is just as bad
as someone else who is acting out this same thing.  </p>

<p>So we cannot wrap our holy rags around us and say that we
are better than anyone else.  We should never do this.  It is only by God&rsquo;s
mercy that we do not go out and act out what is going on within our heart.  God
is just restraining us.  </p>

<p>The remedy from a wicked heart is salvation.  God has to do
that great miracle of salvation within me and give me a new heart, and then I
will start doing things God&rsquo;s way.  Besides this, we, of ourselves, cannot do
this.  We cannot do this in a perfect way that is pleasing to God.  The only
way that we do things that are pleasing to God is when He really saves us. 
Besides this, we cannot do it.  This is because God demands what?  He demands
perfection, and we cannot live up to this standard.  </p>

<p>This is why Christ came and did the work of salvation for
us.  This is what the problem is; and if we look back in Psalm 58, God is
putting His finger on what man&rsquo;s problem is.  It is the heart.  The heart of
man is wicked, and so this is what we need.  We need a new heart.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 58:2, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, in heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is the heart.  This is the problem.  We need a new
heart.  God has to save me, if He wishes to do so.  Other than this, we are
hopeless.  We need a new heart because a sinful heart is going to do sinful
things.  It is our nature to sin because we have a wicked heart right from
birth.  </p>

<p>Those of us who have children, we do not have to teach our
children to sin.  From the moment that you tell a child, &ldquo;Do not do this,&rdquo; this
is what they are going to try to do because they are born &ldquo;speaking lies.&rdquo;  Our
heart is there within us and God is the One, if He so chooses to do so, who has
to give us a new heart.  </p>

<p>Look at Jeremiah.  This is another familiar passage.  These
verses are familiar to most of us.  Do you remember what it says in Jeremiah
17:9?  He starts out:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is pointing at the heart of man, and He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The heart <i>is </i>deceitful above all <i>things</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>It says that our heart is deceitful above all things, and
then it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and desperately wicked: who can know it?  </p>

<p>This is the same thing that we see in Psalm 58.  God is
pointing at the heart of man.  We are wicked people and our hearts are
desperately so.  Our heart has an incurable disease, spiritually speaking, that
only God Himself can cure through the Word of God as we become saved.  </p>

<p>If you look at the world today, they are spending billions
and billions of dollars in trying to cure cancer or in trying to cure heart
disease.  They have the AIDS Walk and the Heart Walk, the &ldquo;this walk&rdquo; and the &ldquo;that
walk,&rdquo; because all they see is the physical part of man.  But there is
something far greater than this, which is our spiritual heart.  </p>

<p>If the Lord were to tarry a little bit longer, our physical
bodies would die.  At the end of the day, we know that we would eventually
die.  But there is something far greater than this spiritually, which is our
heart.  </p>

<p>So God tells us that we do not even know how wicked we are.  Our
heart is desperately wicked, and He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;who can know it?  </p>

<p>God does.  He says in Jeremiah 17:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">I JEHOVAH search the heart, <i>I </i>try the reins, even to give
every man according to his ways, <i>and </i>according to the fruit of his
doings.  </p>

<p>God knows how wicked the heart of man is.  We do not know
our own hearts nor do we know another person&rsquo;s.  I cannot look at someone else&rsquo;s
heart, but God knows it.  God knows.  This is why we so desperately need
salvation.  We desperately, desperately need salvation.  </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 15 where we will see Christ speaking to the
scribes and Pharisees.  We read in Matthew 15:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,
saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they
wash not their hands when they eat bread.  </p>

<p>Can you see where their thinking was?  It was all in the
physical act of washing their hands before they ate.  The traditions of their
fathers were more important to them than what Christ was saying.  </p>

<p>It continues in Matthew 15:3 where Christ is answering
them:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
the commandment of God by your tradition?  </p>

<p>They were not interested in what God&rsquo;s Word was saying. 
They were more interested in what their elders taught.  This was where their
thinking was.  </p>

<p>Look now at verse 19.  Christ is going to get our
attention.  Once you read the whole chapter, you will see the context of what Christ
is saying; but we read in Matthew 15:19-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see what the wicked heart produces?  It produces evil
thoughts.  </p>

<p>He goes on to include:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
blasphemies: These are <i>the things </i>which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
hands defileth not a man.  </p>

<p>They were more interested in the physical act of doing these
things.  However, Christ is getting their attention away from these things and trying
to point to what the problem really is, which is the heart of man and what
comes out of it.  Out of the wicked heart of man flows iniquity and sin, which
is why we so desperately need a new heart.  Our heart is desperately wicked to
no end.  </p>

<p>As we look at society in general, we can see that sin is
multiplying.  Where is this coming from?  It is not coming from the animals. 
It is coming from man as we see sin multiply and multiply and multiply all over
the place.  In the home, in the schools, wherever we look, we see sin and it is
coming from within the heart of man.  This is why we so desperately need a new
heart.  </p>

<p>If we look at another familiar passage in Romans 3, God is
telling us what our heart naturally produces and what comes out of us.  In
Romans 3:10-18, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all
gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that
doeth good, no, not one. Their throat <i>is </i>an open sepulchre; with their
tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is just like what we read in Psalm 58.  An asp is a
snake.  </p>

<p>It continues:     </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the poison of asps <i>is </i>under their lips: Whose mouth <i>is

</i>full of cursing and bitterness: Their feet <i>are </i>swift to shed blood: Destruction
and misery <i>are </i>in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known: There
is no fear of God before their eyes.  </p>

<p>This is God&rsquo;s description of all of us.  This is what all of
us are and it is not a pretty picture that God paints of every single one of us. 
This is why we so desperately need Christ.  We desperately need a new heart
because the time of salvation is coming to a close very quickly.  </p>

<p>Look also at Matthew 23.  As we read through the Gospels, at
times we see Christ, who is God Himself, looking only at the hearts of the scribes
and Pharisees.  Only God can do this and Christ is God Himself.  I cannot look
at your heart and you cannot look at mine; but, here, Christ is looking at the
scribes and Pharisees and putting the finger on the problem.  He is looking at
their heart because He can do this.  If you read through this whole chapter,
you will see this.  God is making an indictment against all of us.  Look at
Matthew 23:25.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean
the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of
extortion and excess.  </p>

<p>A lot of people can pretend and act a certain way.  They can
be nice, but what is going on within their heart?  </p>

<p>Let us continue on.  We read in Matthew 23:26-27:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Thou </i>blind Pharisee, cleanse first that <i>which is </i>within
the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres&hellip;  </p>

<p>Where did we read this word &ldquo;sepulchres&rdquo;?  We read this in
Romans 3.  </p>

<p>We can look down our long noses at the scribes and
Pharisees, &ldquo;Oh, look at them,&rdquo; but Christ is talking to us also.  He just told
us in Romans 3 that we are a sepulcher.  We know what a sepulcher is.  It has a
dead body in it.  This is what God is telling me that I am.  Here in Matthew
23:27, He is telling the Pharisees this same thing:    </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear
beautiful outward&hellip;  </p>

<p>We live in a world that is into the outward showing.  There
is nothing wrong with physical beauty&mdash;God made us all&mdash;but the world focuses on
what they can see outwardly.  People can pretend to be nice or try to be nice
or just be a nice person, but God is looking at the heart.  He is looking at
the heart of man:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within&hellip;  </p>

<p>So He is looking at the heart, which is:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;within full of dead <i>men&rsquo;s </i>bones, and of all uncleanness. 
</p>

<p>What is going on within your heart?  This is what Christ is
looking at.  </p>

<p>Then Matthew 23:28 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even so ye also&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is talking to me and to you:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;ye also outwardly appear righteous&hellip;  </p>

<p>Many people are like this.  This reminds me of today.  We
are living in a day where we can know a great deal about the Bible.  We can
have all of this head knowledge.  We can understand all forms of doctrine and
all sorts of things from the Bible.  We can quote Scripture.  We have the &ldquo;Open
Forum&rdquo; and our Bibles and many booklets.  We can know all of these things, or
we can appear to know all of these things intellectually, but the question is, &ldquo;Am
I born again?  Am I truly a child of God?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Matthew 23:28 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men&hellip;  </p>

<p>We can appear to be saved.  We do not know who is saved, but
someone can appear this way.  </p>

<p>Then God says as He continues looking at the heart:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  </p>

<p>So this is where Christ is looking.  He is looking within at
the heart of man.  What is really going on within our heart?  This is what He is
looking at and why we so desperately need a new heart.  Christ already told us
in the book of Jeremiah that the heart of man is &ldquo;desperately wicked.&rdquo; 
Outwardly, we can appear one way; but, inwardly, our heart can be somewhere
else.  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 23:29-33, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, And
say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been
partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses
unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill
ye up then the measure of your fathers.<i> Ye </i>serpents&hellip;  </p>

<p>Is this not what Christ tells us in Psalm 58, that our
mouths are full of poison?  </p>

<p>When I speak to others, I often explain to them that this is
 Christ talking to us.  Some people tend to think of Jesus as just this
beautiful baby Jesus, but Christ is calling us a serpent or a snake.  In the
Bible, we know that Satan is known as a serpent.  He tells us in the Bible, &ldquo;Ye
are of <i>your </i>father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.&rdquo; 
This is what we will do if we are not truly a child of God.  </p>

<p>So He says in Matthew 23:33:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Ye </i>serpents, <i>ye </i>generation of vipers, how can ye
escape the damnation of hell?  </p>

<p>This is Christ&rsquo;s indictment for all of us.  As I said
earlier, we cannot be looking at this as if He is speaking only to the
Pharisees.  As we read the Bible, God is speaking to all of us.  He is speaking
to all of us and we can learn from this.  </p>

<p>Here Christ is standing in front of them and He is looking
at their heart, because He knows their thoughts and the intents of their
heart.  This is what God is looking at and He is, so-called, calling them out. 
Outwardly, we can look a certain way; but inwardly where God is looking at, we
are full of dead men&rsquo;s bones and we are &ldquo;whited sepulchres.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So each one of us really needs to examine ourselves in light
of the Bible.  When God says that I am this way, then I am this way; because
God tells us that He knows the secrets of our hearts.  He knows the very
intent.  He knows all things.  We cannot hide anything from God.  God sees all
things.  He sees every one of us and He knows whatever is going on within the
heart of every single human being, all of us.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Psalm 50:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes, or <i>that </i>thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? Seeing
thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.  </p>

<p>This is what man does.  Unsaved man does not want to hear
the Word of God.  This goes back to Psalm 58.  We want to listen to &ldquo;charmers,
charming never so wisely.&rdquo;  This is what God says about us as we come into this
world.  We do not hear God&rsquo;s Word.  By nature, we hate the Bible.  We should
not want to hate what the Bible has to say to us.  </p>

<p>Many of us hand out tracts.  The moment you hand a tract to
a person and they see the title of it, they step back.  This is because God&rsquo;s
Word judges man.  It judges us; and by nature, we do not want to hear it.  </p>

<p>So this is speaking of the wicked; and in Psalm 50:17, we
see that he &ldquo;hatest instruction.&rdquo;  But God&rsquo;s Word is given to us &ldquo;for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo;  We had nothing
to do with it.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 50:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">When thou sawest a thief&hellip;  </p>

<p>And Satan is known as a thief.  Someone who is bringing a
false gospel is also known as a thief in the Bible because they are stealing
the Word of God.  This is what evil man wants to hear.  He wants to hear a
Gospel that is patterned after his flesh.  </p>

<p>A lot of these false gospels, if you notice, they cater to
man&rsquo;s flesh.  They tell mankind what they want to hear.  This is what unsaved
man wants to hear.  They want to hear a gospel that is going to make them feel
good.  It will be a gospel that will tell him that he is a good person and that
all he needs to do is this or that to become saved.  This is what man wants to
hear.  But do they want to hear the truth of the Gospel?  No.  </p>

<p>Psalm 50:18-19 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil&hellip;  </p>

<p>Normally, what is going on in our heart comes out through
our mouth, as it says here:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.  </p>

<p>This is what comes out naturally from our rebellious and
wicked heart against God.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 109, we will see this same thing.  Psalm 109:1-2
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; For the mouth of the
wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see what man is doing?  Our mouths are opened against
God.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.  </p>

<p>This is what the mouth of the wicked does.  It speaks
against God because we have no care for what the Bible is saying to us.  </p>

<p>Also turn to Proverbs 6.  There are a whole host of verses,
because the Bible has a lot to say about the wicked.  These are only a few
verses that deal with the wicked and what is going to happen to them in the day
of judgment.  We read in Proverbs 6:12-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. He
winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
Frowardness <i>is </i>in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth
discord. Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy. These six <i>things </i>doth JEHOVAH hate: yea, seven <i>are
</i>an abomination unto him: A proud look&hellip;  </p>

<p>By nature, we have a proud heart.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">A proud look, a lying tongue&hellip;  </p>

<p>We all know what a &ldquo;lying tongue&rdquo; is.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and hands that shed innocent blood,  </p>

<p>This goes back to Romans 3.  We are &ldquo;swift to shed blood,&rdquo;
as Romans 3 says; and out of the heart comes all kinds of murders and
adulteries and fornications.  This is what comes out of our wicked heart.  This
is how we are.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Proverbs 6:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">An heart&hellip;  </p>

<p>God is coming back to the heart in Proverbs 6:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is where all of these things come from.  They come out
of the heart.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;feet that be swift in running to mischief,  </p>

<p>This is what comes out of our evil heart: wickedness.  It is
wickedness and it is constant.  </p>

<p>Do you see how desperately we need a new heart, that miracle
of salvation?  This is the only remedy for our rebellious ways, that rebellious
nature that is in all of us.  This is why we read in Ezekiel 36 that God has to
take that stony heart away from us.  He says, &ldquo;I will give you an heart of
flesh,&rdquo; a heart of Christ; and this is only something that God can do.  </p>

<p>We know that salvation is a miracle.  We have to wonder why
God would save anyone.  When we see His description of all of us, why would He
even bother?  But, wonderfully, God is gracious and He is merciful.  Still, we
just have to wonder why He would save anyone.  It just boggles the mind that He
would take the time to give us the Bible, that He would take the time
throughout the ages to save this one and that one.  </p>

<p>If we are saved, we all have a different story.  All of us
were involved in all sorts of wickedness.  By God&rsquo;s mercy, He saved you if you
are a child of God.  Do you see how wonderful God is that He would even look at
anyone and save them?  </p>

<p>Returning back to Proverbs 6:14, it says:   </p>

<p class="verse">Frowardness <i>is </i>in his heart, he deviseth mischief
continually; he soweth discord.  </p>

<p>I believe that this word &ldquo;frowardness&rdquo; has to do with
perversion or the perverted heart of man, out from which comes all manner of
wickedness.  We wonder why the world is the way it is.  It is because of man&rsquo;s
rebellion.  What comes out of man&rsquo;s heart is all sorts of ugly things.  This is
what comes out of the heart of man.  </p>

<p>Look at Proverbs 15:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
anger. The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools
poureth out foolishness.  </p>

<p>And it is coming out of the heart.  The &ldquo;fools&rdquo; are those
who are not saved.  The heart &ldquo;poureth out foolishness.&rdquo;  Rubbishness comes out
of the heart of unsaved man.  What is unsaved man talking about?  He is talking
about the world, sports, etc.  Whatever he is speaking about, it is
foolishness.  What comes out of the heart of unsaved man is utter rubbish,
because he is not using his lips to glorify God.  So we have to be careful about
what we talk about.  If you are a child of God, you love speaking about
spiritual things.  </p>

<p>Have you ever spoken to someone after you just heard a Bible
study that is fresh in your mind?  You want to talk to them about this study,
but the conversation goes right to the world.  It goes right to the world, and
yet you are trying to get them to go back to talking about some Bible verses. 
But this is not the way their thoughts are.  They want to talk about the world,
something else, maybe sports or clothing or something that they have done.  </p>

<p>Today is the Lord&rsquo;s Day and we should not want to talk about
worldly things.  You are trying to turn the conversation back to what you heard
maybe in a Bible study or maybe something new that you have learned from the
Bible.  You are trying to get them to talk about the Bible, but their thoughts
are not there.  Their heart wants to talk about something else.  But for the
child of God, because God has given you a new heart, your joy is to talk about
spiritual things.  </p>

<p>A group of people can get together where they are supposed
to be speaking about God&rsquo;s Word, and yet their minds can be all over the
place.  But for a child of God, they want to speak about spiritual things because
of their new heart.  Out of this new heart that God has given them, they want
to talk about spiritual things.  </p>

<p>Look also at Psalm 10 where God is speaking about the
wicked.  We read in Psalm 10:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Why standest thou afar off, O JEHOVAH? <i>why </i>hidest thou <i>thyself
</i>in times of trouble? The wicked in <i>his </i>pride&hellip;  </p>

<p>And this is a whole other issue.  The wicked have a proud
heart.  When you hear people speaking about pride in our land, they say, &ldquo;Oh,
be proud of yourself.&rdquo;  But no; if you honestly look at yourself through the
Bible, what is there to be proud of?  Pride is a root sin that is in all of us
that needs to be rooted out.  Even after you become a child of God, pride will
rear its ugly head in your life.  True believers have to walk very humbly before
God and pray to God for mercy.  </p>

<p>He continues in Psalm 10:2 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">The wicked in <i>his </i>pride doth persecute the poor: let them
be taken in the devices that they have imagined.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 10:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the wicked boasteth of his heart&rsquo;s desire&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is what he does.  The wicked heart is boasting in what
he has done.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Psalm 10:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">The wicked&hellip;  </p>

<p>God is continuing to speak about the wicked:  </p>

<p class="verse">The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <i>after
God</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see how God speaks about the wicked?  The wicked will
not seek after God.  As a matter of fact, God seeks us out.  He seeks us.  We
do not seek Him.  God seeks us out and He saves us.  He tells us clearly in the
Bible that He came &ldquo;to seek and to save that which was lost.&rdquo;  So God is the
One who seeks us out.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 10:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is pride.  He may not consciously think this all out,
but this is what he is thinking &ldquo;in his heart.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>It goes on in Psalm 10:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud&hellip;  </p>

<p>This goes right back to Psalm 58 [<i>note: speaker meant to
say Psalm and not Isaiah</i>] and Romans 3.  This is what God is saying about
the wicked.  If you are not saved, this is what is coming out of your heart:  </p>

<p class="verse">His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
tongue <i>is </i>mischief and vanity.  </p>

<p>God is telling us what we are really like.  We are wicked
and the cure for this is salvation.  </p>

<p>As we know, we are living in these last days before the end
and salvation is still possible.  How can it be that God would save anyone?  It
boggles the mind that He would save one person.  God would be perfectly
justified in sending all of us into destruction forever.  He would be perfectly
just in doing this.  The more we think about this wonderful salvation that God
has given to us, the more we realize that this is an amazing salvation.  </p>

<p>God gave us a perfect example of this.  We are becoming very
familiar now with Jonah.  When Christ sent Jonah to Nineveh, God tells us what
these people were like.  Look at Jonah 1:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the word of JEHOVAH came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
wickedness&hellip;  </p>

<p>It was a very wicked city.  They were no different than any of
us.  God tells us what the city of Nineveh was and it was a very wicked city. 
They were doing all manner of wickedness there, and here He sends this man into
this wicked city with the Gospel.  </p>

<p>This is the answer, is it not, for wickedness, for sin
problems?  The answer is the Word of God and salvation.  As you read on in
Jonah 3, you will see that God saves this city.  </p>

<p>None of us is beyond salvation, no matter what kind of
wickedness we have been in or are involved in presently.  No matter what our
situation is, the grace of God is sufficient.  God can save anyone.  </p>

<p>People have all sorts of excuses, &ldquo;Well, I did this in my
past and I did that, so how could God save me?  I am a wicked person.&rdquo;  But
they are the perfect candidate for salvation.  God can save anyone.  No matter
what a person has been involved in, God can save this person.  </p>

<p>God tells us in the Bible, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in the death
of the wicked.&rdquo;  He has none whatsoever.  It is not like He is going to destroy
man with a smile on His face.  No, we were made in the image of God.   </p>

<p>Another verse is in Ezekiel 18.  We read in Ezekiel
18:30-32:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
according to his ways, saith the Lord JEHOVAH. Repent, and turn <i>yourselves</i>&hellip; 
</p>

<p>We have to be careful with this verse.  We can stop drinking
or we can stop some sin, but this does not save us.  The repentance that we
need is God&rsquo;s repentance.  True repentance is a gift of God.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Repent, and turn <i>yourselves </i>from all your transgressions;
so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions,
whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for
why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him
that dieth, saith the Lord JEHOVAH: wherefore turn <i>yourselves, </i>and live
ye.  </p>

<p>This is the grace of God.  It is God&rsquo;s mercy.  Although He
says, &ldquo;make you a new heart,&rdquo; we know that we cannot do this.  God is the One
who has to give us a new heart, but God has no pleasure in sending wicked
people to hell.  </p>

<p>Wonderfully in our day, God is still saving a great
multitude of people.  He is still saving sinners, and so we do not have any
excuse, none whatsoever.  We have no excuse because, wonderfully, God gives us
this privilege to cry to Him for mercy.  It may be that He might save you.  But
you need to stop sinning.  That will not save you, but stop doing wickedness
and cry to God for mercy.  It may be that He might save you.  </p>

<p>You know that you need a new heart.  God points the finger
at the problem and it is our heart.  Our heart produces all sorts of
wickedness.  It is in our very nature to sin against God.  </p>

<p>Wonderfully, though, today is still the day of salvation. 
God is still saving a great multitude, and it could be me or it could be you if
you are not saved.  So we come humbly before God and we plead, as we know,
because time is running out.  Time is coming to an end.  </p>

<p>I do not know what your stand is on May 21, 2011.  This is true, but for the sake of speaking, let us just say that it is going to happen
regardless of where you stand.  You get there on that day and you are left
behind.  This means that May 21, 2011 is going to be the most horrible thing
imaginable for you, because God will destroy the wicked.  The Bible has
declared this and God is faithful to His Word.  He will destroy the wicked in
that day.  </p>

<p>Let us stop here.  </p>
