<p>Let us open our Bibles to Genesis 1, the book of the
beginning.  God tells us in Genesis 1:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.  </p>

<p>God tells us here that mankind was made in the image of
God.  I do not know the full import of this verse, but one thing I do know is
that mankind knows right from wrong.  We are not animals.  Some believe this is
all that we are and that we evolved over millions of years.  </p>

<p>No; the Bible tells us that we are made in the image of
God.  Because of this, we know that it is wrong to murder.  We know that it is
wrong to commit adultery.  We know that it is wrong to tell lies.  </p>

<p>Animals do not know this.  We are the highest created beings
in God&rsquo;s creation.  He has created all things and He tells us that we are made
in the image of God.  </p>

<p>For instance, go to Romans 2 where God gives us a little bit
more information on this.  There could be someone who had never heard the
Bible.  He could have lived and died and never heard about the Bible, but yet
God tells us in Romans 2:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">(For not the hearers of the law <i>are </i>just before God, but
the doers of the law shall be justified. For when the Gentiles, which have not
the law&hellip;  </p>

<p>These are people who do not have the Bible.  They have never
heard of it.  They have not the Law, but when they:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not
the law, are a law unto themselves:  </p>

<p>To a certain degree, although mankind is in rebellion
against God, God&rsquo;s Law is on his heart.  We know right from wrong.  We know
that we do not have to teach a child to lie.  How does a child know that they
are not to lie?  It is because we are made in the image of God and God&rsquo;s Law,
to a certain degree, is written on man&rsquo;s heart, although he is in rebellion
against the Law of God.  </p>

<p>It goes on in Romans 2:15 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their
conscience also bearing witness, and <i>their </i>thoughts the mean while
accusing or else excusing one another;) </p>

<p>This is the key.  The Law of God is on our conscience.  We
intuitively know that it is wrong to lie, to murder, to commit adultery.  We
know all of these things.  We know this without a doubt.  We also know that the
whole Bible is a Law Book.  The Bible is the Law of God.  The Bible is for the
whole human race.  It is God who is speaking to us through the pages of the
Bible and He has many, many things to say to us.  </p>

<p>One of the things that I want to go into is something that I
was looking at last night.  Although we are made in the image of God, there is
a Day of Judgment that is coming on all the world, and yet God has no pleasure
in destroying man.  He has no pleasure in doing this.  He has no pleasure
sending man, whom He has created in His image, to destruction, and yet He
clearly tells us in Romans 6:23:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the wages of sin <i>is </i>death&hellip;  </p>

<p>The payment for our sin and rebellion is to be destroyed
forever.  Of ourselves, we cannot get around this.  The only way that we can
get around this is by God saving us.  God is not going to change His Law.  </p>

<p>There are many people who do not believe the Bible at all. 
They just go about their lives while scoffing and mocking the Bible.  They have
all kinds of things to say about it.  Some may say, &ldquo;Part of the Bible was
written by man and part of it was written by God, so how can you be certain of
it?&rdquo;  They just go on and on.  </p>

<p>This is not going to change the fact that the Bible is the
Word of God.  It is a Law Book.  When we break the Law, the Law of God demands
death.  It demands judgment.  We must have our sins paid for.  </p>

<p>Can you see how desperately you need a Savior?  It makes no
difference who you are.  The Law of God is the Law of God.  </p>

<p>As we learned this past week as we listened to Family Radio,
Mr. Camping has been speaking about King Solomon.  Who would have ever thought
that King Solomon was not a saved man?  He was the wisest man who ever lived. 
He was the richest man who ever lived.  Yet we see in his final days that he
was not a saved man and that he will be destroyed forever.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;God is no respecter of persons.&rdquo;  It makes no difference
what your abilities are.  Faith does not come by understanding and because of
how smart someone might be.  The Bible says, &ldquo;Faith [<i>or </i><i>Chris</i><i>t</i>]
<i>cometh </i>by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&rdquo;  This has nothing to
do with our personal abilities or where we might be from.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Ezekiel 18.  God has no pleasure in
destroying man whom He has created in His image.  In Ezekiel 18:23, let us hear what God says.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?&hellip;  </p>

<p>He has no pleasure in destroying the wicked, none
whatsoever.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
Lord JEHOVAH: <i>and </i>not that he should return from his ways, and live?  </p>

<p>He has no pleasure in destroying man, none whatsoever.  He
is not sitting up in Heaven just waiting to destroy man.  God is a very
merciful God.  He is the very essence of mercy, but He has to do what He says
that He will do.  He has no pleasure in destroying man, yet the Law of God
demands this.  </p>

<p>Look at Ezekiel 18:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the
Lord JEHOVAH: wherefore turn <i>yourselves, </i>and live ye.  </p>

<p>God has &ldquo;no pleasure in the death of the wicked&rdquo; because God
is merciful.  Can you see why we need a Saviour?  </p>

<p>As we look throughout the history of Israel and how God
dealt with the nation of Israel, how He would forgive them and raise up another
king, how He dealt with them in a loving and merciful way, we learn that there
came a point when He put them away.  </p>

<p>The Bible clearly tells us that God&rsquo;s door of mercy is not
an open-ended thing.  God will not keep His door of mercy open forever.  There
will come a time when He will shut the door, just like He did in the days of
Noah.  He used Noah to build the ark and to warn the people of a coming flood. 
For one hundred and twenty years, He warned the people of Noah&rsquo;s day that the
flood was coming.  </p>

<p>We can see the mercy of God in this.  He had Noah build that
huge ship.  Did they listen?  No and there came a point when the door to the
ark was shut.  He closed the door and no one else was getting in.  He then
destroyed the people of that day, but He had no pleasure in doing this.  </p>

<p>So it is in our day.  On May 21, 2011, the door of mercy will be shut.  God will no longer be saving people on that day.  When all the
activities of that day are happening, then man will begin to know that the
Bible was true all along.  The door of mercy will then be shut.  No one else
will get in, but the door right now is wide open.  </p>

<p>We could go to God like the Ninevites.  You have heard of
Jonah.  We are increasingly becoming familiar with the prophet Jonah who went
to Nineveh, how God warned them and they listened.  God saved them and that was
the mercy of God.  </p>

<p>So it is in our day.  God is still saving sinners, which all
of us are.  We all have something in common, which is that we are all sinners. 
We all also deserve the same fate.  We deserve to be destroyed forever; but, wonderfully,
God is still saving in our day, is He not?  God is merciful.  He is merciful,
but the day will come when He will no longer be saving.  </p>

<p>Turn to Ezekiel 33.  A lot of us are familiar with these
verses.  We read in Ezekiel 33:10-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins <i>be </i>upon us,
and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, <i>As </i>I
live, saith the Lord JEHOVAH, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked;
but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil
ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?  </p>

<p>Do you see the mercy of God that is displayed over and over
again to mankind?  This is nothing but the mercy of God.  God tells us to &ldquo;turn
ye from your evil ways,&rdquo; but we have to be careful with this word &ldquo;turn&rdquo;
because God is the One who has to turn us to Himself.  </p>

<p>In the days of Jonah, they did not know whether God was
going to save them or not.  They just pitifully cried out to God for mercy. 
God in His great mercy and great kindness saved a great multitude in that day,
and so it is in our day.  </p>

<p>How can it be that God would save anyone?  Look at the world
that we are living in.  Sin is multiplying.  Man is in rebellion and goes about
his own way, and yet the Bible says, &ldquo;but his hand <i>is </i>stretched out
still.&rdquo;  He is still saving people yet in our day.  </p>

<p>It makes no difference who you are.  God is a merciful,
merciful God and He has no pleasure in destroying man whom He has created in
His image and likeness.  But as I said earlier, He just cannot put His Law
aside.  He must do what He says, because God is faithful to His Word.  He is
going to do what He has committed Himself to do.  Because of this, we know that
this Day of Judgment is fast approaching.  </p>

<p>Turn again to Ezekiel 18.  Here God says in Ezekiel 18:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.  </p>

<p>This says, &ldquo;The soul that sinneth, it shall die.&rdquo;  Parents
are not responsible for the sins of their children.  They are not.  Children
are responsible for their own sins.  Here He tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the soul that sinneth, it shall die.  </p>

<p>Turn over to Psalm 5.  We read in Psalm 5:1-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Give ear to my words, O JEHOVAH, consider my meditation. Hearken
unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. My
voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O JEHOVAH; in the morning will I direct <i>my
prayer </i>unto thee, and will look up. For thou <i>art </i>not a God that hath
pleasure in wickedness&hellip;  </p>

<p>God has no pleasure in sin, in wickedness.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;neither shall evil dwell with thee. The foolish shall not stand
in thy sight&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who are the foolish?  The foolish are all the unsaved of the
world.  They are foolish because God refers to them as &ldquo;fools.&rdquo;  It continues: 
</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou hatest all workers of iniquity.  </p>

<p>God hates sinners with a perfect hatred.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 5:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: JEHOVAH will abhor
the bloody and deceitful man.  </p>

<p>God is going to destroy wicked unsaved man on October 21, 2011.  There will be a five-month period after Judgment Day begins on May 21, 2011.  This will continue for five months during which God will then be pouring
out His wrath upon the unsaved of the world.  God is going to punish them for
their sin.  On October 21, 2011, they will be destroyed forever.  </p>

<p>He has to do what He says.  There are many who mock the
Bible because they are still yet in their sin, but remember that the Bible says
that &ldquo;the wages of sin <i>is </i>death.&rdquo;  The payment for sin is death.  This
is why God will begin to pour out His wrath on all those remaining on May 21, 2011.  </p>

<p>How awful this will be for those who are left behind on that
Day of Judgment!  Unsaved man will begin to experience the wrath of God.  It
will be terrible for those who are left behind to face the wrath of an angry
God.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Hebrews 10.  This is another thing that God
has no pleasure in.  We will start in Hebrews 10:1.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the law having a shadow of good things to come, <i>and </i>not
the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  </p>

<p>This is speaking about all those blood sacrifices that were
offered in the Old Testament.  Thousands and thousands of animals were
slaughtered by the priests, and yet this did not take away sin.  It was a work
that the children of Israel were doing, but God had no delight in this.  </p>

<p>We have to also remember that our works will never save us. 
There is nothing that we can do to merit salvation.  It is the work of Christ
that saves us.  Israel was offering all of these burnt sacrifices.  This was a
work that they were doing, but God had no delight in this.  We will see this as
we read on.  </p>

<p>It says in Hebrews 10:2-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that
the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. But in
those <i>sacrifices there is </i>a remembrance again <i>made </i>of sins every
year. For <i>it is </i>not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
take away sins.  </p>

<p>All of those sacrifices that they were making did nothing to
take away sin.  It was pointing to Christ: &ldquo;the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 10:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: In burnt
offerings and <i>sacrifices </i>for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  </p>

<p>So God had no pleasure in what Israel was doing.  It was all
works.  We also know, according to the Bible, that Israel perished in the
wilderness &ldquo;because of unbelief.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Maybe we have thought that if a person could only see something,
they would believe it; but this is not so.  The Israelites heard the voice of
God.  God parted the Red Sea before their eyes.  God fed them in the wilderness
for forty years.  God fought for them.  God did all of these things for the
nation of Israel, things that they could see with their eyes, and yet they
perished &ldquo;because of unbelief.&rdquo;  They did not believe God.  There were a few who
were saved, but the majority of them perished &ldquo;because of unbelief&rdquo;; and so all
of those sacrifices that were instituted in that day never saved anyone.  </p>

<p>This is like someone in the churches of our day who thinks
that water baptism or walking down the aisle after a sermon and accepting the
Lord is going to save them, but these things never save anyone.  </p>

<p>It is Christ who saves.  He has done the work and He is the
One who has to give us a new heart.  This is something that we cannot do.  He
has to give us His Holy Spirit.  This is something that we just cannot do. 
Salvation is totally the work of God.  It has nothing to do with us doing
anything, but God does allow us to cry for mercy.  He does permit sinners to
approach unto Him.  </p>

<p>How can it be that Almighty God allows sinful man to
approach unto Him and plead for mercy?  He saves this one here and that one
there.  How can this be?  We are approaching the &ldquo;King of kings, and Lord of
lords,&rdquo; His majesty, the Creator of the whole universe.  Remember that all it
took was for God to speak in order to bring this creation into existence with
all of its billions of lifeforms.  Wow!  God has created it all, all things
above the sea and under the sea and on the land.  The Bible says, &ldquo;What is man,
that thou art mindful of him?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we read on in Hebrews 10, it says in Hebrews 10:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
and <i>offering </i>for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure <i>therein;
</i>which are offered by the law;  </p>

<p>He had no pleasure in those burnt offerings.  God had no
pleasure in those things.  </p>

<p>Let us move on a little bit further and look at Hebrews
10:37.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.  </p>

<p>There is coming the Day of Judgment.  God says that He will
come and that He will not tarry.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Hebrews 10:38-39:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the just shall live by faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know whose faith this is.  It is the &ldquo;faith of Christ.&rdquo; 
It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now the just shall live by faith: but if <i>any man </i>draw
back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw
back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  </p>

<p>God has no pleasure in these things, none whatsoever.  </p>

<p>Let us turn to Isaiah 1.  This is still speaking about the
burnt offerings.  We read in Isaiah 1:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Except JEHOVAH of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,
we should have been as Sodom, <i>and </i>we should have been like unto Gomorrah. 
</p>

<p>We know according to the Bible in Genesis 19 what happened
to Sodom and Gomorrah.  God destroyed them.  If God had not chosen a people
unto salvation from eternity past, all of us would likewise be destroyed.  On
Judgment Day, we would all be totally destroyed if God had not elected a people
to Himself.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 1:11.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">To what purpose <i>is </i>the multitude of your sacrifices unto
me? saith JEHOVAH: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed
beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he
goats.  </p>

<p>Do you see what Israel was involved in?  God did not delight
in this.  He did not delight in this at all.  He had no pleasure in this.  </p>

<p>As we read on, it says in Isaiah 1:16-19:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil; Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve
the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us
reason together, saith JEHOVAH: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye
be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  </p>

<p>These are the things that God delights in.  In other words,
He delights in &ldquo;a broken and a contrite heart.&rdquo;  This is what He delights in. 
God says elsewhere in Isaiah, &ldquo;But to this <i>man </i>will I look, <i>even </i>to
<i>him that is </i>poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.&rdquo;  He
takes delight in that person.  Who knows?  He might save that person.  </p>

<p>So God takes no pleasure in man and his rebellion.  He takes
no pleasure in sin and wickedness at all, but He does go on to tell us what He
delights in.  There are many other verses that we could look at.  These are
only a few that I was looking at last night.  He has &ldquo;no pleasure in the death
of the wicked&hellip;for why will ye die?&rdquo;  This is why God provided this wonderful
and magnificent salvation plan for the human race.  </p>

<p>By nature, we love this world and the things that it has to
offer, the niceties of this life.  God has created a beautiful planet and put
us on it and we love it.  Mankind does not want to see this be destroyed, but
God has prepared for His people something far greater than the pleasures of
this world and of this life.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 149.  We read in Psalm 149:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye JEHOVAH. Sing unto JEHOVAH a new song, <i>and </i>his
praise in the congregation of saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him:
let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. Let them praise his name in
the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. For
JEHOVAH taketh pleasure in his people&hellip;  </p>

<p>Do you see what God takes pleasure in?  He takes pleasure in
His people.  It continues:    </p>

<p class="verse">For JEHOVAH taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the
meek with salvation.  </p>

<p>God takes pleasure in those who love Him, not in the wicked
or the foolish.  </p>

<p>He goes on to talk about the saints in verse 5, and the
saints are God&rsquo;s elect.  We read in Psalm 149:5-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
their beds.<i> Let </i>the high <i>praises </i>of God <i>be </i>in their mouth,
and a twoedged sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, <i>and
</i>punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and their
nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written: this
honour have all his saints. Praise ye JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>We see one thing here that God takes pleasure in.  He takes
pleasure in His people.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 147.  We will start reading at Psalm 147:10. 
It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man.  </p>

<p>You could be young and strong and a great athlete, but God
has no pleasure in this.  </p>

<p>Psalm 147:11 tells us what He takes pleasure in:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH taketh pleasure in them that fear him&hellip;  </p>

<p>Fearing God is to be obedient to Him.  God tells us in the
Bible, &ldquo;If ye love me, keep my commandments.&rdquo;  He also tells us, &ldquo;Be ye doers
of the word, and not hearers only.&rdquo;  We can hear the Word, but we have to do
what He says.  Those who do are the ones who truly fear Jehovah.  </p>

<p>Psalm 147:11-12 goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
hope in his mercy. Praise JEHOVAH, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.  </p>

<p>We can see that this is one thing that He takes pleasure
in.  </p>

<p>Look also at Ephesians 1 where God is speaking about
election and when it was that He made the choice to save someone.  Remember
that God elected His children in Him &ldquo;before the foundation of the world.&rdquo;  God
could do this.  He is infinite in His wisdom and He made the decision on those
He would save for Himself before He created the world.  We do not know who they
are because this is God&rsquo;s business.  It says in Ephesians 1:4-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having
predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself,
according to the good pleasure of his will,  </p>

<p>It was God&rsquo;s pleasure to save a people for Himself.  Out of
the billions of people who would be ever be born into this world, God took
pleasure in choosing a few, a very tiny remnant for Himself; and it is God&rsquo;s
business whom He has decided to save.  </p>

<p>Look at Ephesians 1:9.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to
his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:  </p>

<p>It was God&rsquo;s &ldquo;good pleasure&rdquo; to save a people for Himself. 
He could have sent every one of us right down to hell [<i>or to the grave/destruction</i>]
because we are all wicked sinners; but in His great mercy, He has decided to
save a people for Himself.  This number will total into the millions.  </p>

<p>If you are truly saved, does the wicked of the world envy
you?  No; they look down at you, &ldquo;You poor soul.  You are wasting your life!&rdquo; 
But as we look at the Bible, we see Christ, God Himself, and He chose
fishermen, He saved a prostitute, He saved the outcast.  </p>

<p>The ones in the church of our day walk around with a certain
attitude, &ldquo;Look at me.  I am a Reverend!&rdquo;  This does not mean anything.  It is
the lowly ones whom Christ saves.  In the church of Christ&rsquo;s day, the Pharisees
and the Jews rejected Him.  They rejected God!  They claimed, &ldquo;Look at Him!  He
is eating with publicans and sinners!&rdquo;  They thought that they were better than
anyone else.  God then went to the Gentiles, and we see how wonderful God truly
is.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a couple more verses.  Turn to Jeremiah 9:24. 
This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
and knoweth me, that I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH which exercise lovingkindness,
judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <i>things </i>I
delight, saith JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>Do you see what He delights in?  God delights in &ldquo;lovingkindness,
judgment, and righteousness.&rdquo;  He delights in these things.  People say that
they do not know what God wants.  Read the Bible and find out for yourself what
God delights in.  </p>

<p>When we truly become saved, God says that He has &ldquo;delivered
us from the power of darkness, and hath translated <i>us </i>into the kingdom
of his dear Son.&rdquo;  We, too, are then going to delight in the same things that
God delights in, because He has given us &ldquo;a new heart.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>If you are now saved, you can look back in your life to see
the person you were before you became saved.  You were no different than anyone
else; but now God has given you a new heart and you love the Word of God.  The
only way that you are going to love the Word of God is if He gives you a new
heart, else the Bible will make no sense to you.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a passage in Psalm 119.  The whole Bible is
beautiful, but Psalm 119 really gets into how we stack up against the Word of
God.  He is speaking of a true believer, and He says in Psalm 119:16-18:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will delight myself in thy statutes&hellip;  </p>

<p>The true believer is going to delight in the Word of God. 
When we see the word &ldquo;statutes&rdquo; or &ldquo;judgments&rdquo; or &ldquo;commandments,&rdquo; these have to
do with the Bible.  The true believers are going to delight in God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I will not forget thy word. Deal bountifully with thy servant, <i>that
</i>I may live, and keep thy word. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold
wondrous things out of thy law.  </p>

<p>Do you see how the true believers are going to delight in
the Law of God?  </p>

<p>Psalm 119:24 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy testimonies&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the whole Bible, God&rsquo;s Word.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy testimonies also<i> are </i>my delight <i>and </i>my
counsellors.  </p>

<p>For the true believers, the Bible is our counselor and we
delight in the Word of God.  </p>

<p>If you say that you are a child of God and yet you are not
delighting yourself in the Bible, Psalm 37:1-5 tells us:  </p>

<p class="verse">Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the
grass, and wither as the green herb. Trust in JEHOVAH, and do good; <i>so </i>shalt
thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking to the true believers.  What are we to
delight in?  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Delight thyself also in JEHOVAH; and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto JEHOVAH; trust also in him; and he
shall bring <i>it </i>to pass.  </p>

<p>Then in Psalm 37:11, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves
in the abundance of peace.  </p>

<p>The true believers delight in the Word of God.  There are
many other verses that we could look at to see the things that God delights
in.  He does not delight in destroying man.  He has no pleasure in doing this. 
He also has no pleasure in the wicked.  </p>

<p>We were created in the image of God.  We can see from the
Bible what God delights in.  As true believers, because He has given us a new
heart, we also are going to delight in spiritual things, in God&rsquo;s Word, in the
Bible.  We should want to spend the rest of our time doing nothing else but
reading the Word of God, studying it, and doing what He commands us to do.  </p>

<p>Let us close.  </p>
