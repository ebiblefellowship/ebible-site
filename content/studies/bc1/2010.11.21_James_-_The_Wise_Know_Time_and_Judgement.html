title: The Wise Know Time and Judgement
---
<p>Most of the time when we go to hand out tracts and we are
witnessing to people, a lot of people raise questions as to why May 21<sup>st</sup>
will be Judgment Day.  The Bible gives us the assurance as to why God has
declared that to be the Day of Judgment.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Isaiah 42:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">I <i>am </i>JEHOVAH: that <i>is </i>my name: and my glory will I
not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. Behold, the former
things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth
I tell you of them.  </p>

<p>God is letting us know in these verses here that God is the
One who knows the end from the beginning and that only He can declare things
before they happen.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Isaiah 48:3-5.  We read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did <i>them </i>suddenly, and
they came to pass. Because I knew that thou <i>art </i>obstinate&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;obstinate&rdquo; means &ldquo;stiff-necked.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and thy neck <i>is </i>an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; I
have even from the beginning declared <i>it </i>to thee; before it came to pass
I showed <i>it </i>thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and
my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.  </p>

<p>As God has been declaring that May 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011
will be Judgment Day, He is using the true believers as prophets and has
commanded them to go out into the world to let the world know that He is going
to bring this judgment to pass.  The reason that He is doing this is because
when May 21<sup>st</sup> comes around and the world encounters Judgment Day,
people are going to then know that this is from God.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of people who worship Buddha.  There are
people who worship the virgin Mary.  People are still worshipping all kinds of
graven images, and yet God says that He will not give His glory to any other
god.  Of course, we know that there is only One God and that He will declare who
He is on that day.  There are going to be many people that this is going to be
a very sad time for because there are many people who are still bowing down to
false idols and who are still worshipping false gods.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Ecclesiastes 3.  We read in Ecclesiastes
3:1-8:  </p>

<p class="verse">To every <i>thing there is </i>a season, and a time to every
purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to
plant, and a time to pluck up <i>that which is </i>planted; A time to kill, and
a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep,
and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; A time to cast away
stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and
a time to cast away; A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
and a time to speak; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a
time of peace.  </p>

<p>The emphasis of this is in Ecclesiastes 3:1 where God says: 
</p>

<p class="verse">To every <i>thing there is </i>a season, and a time to every
purpose under the heaven:  </p>

<p>God gives us many time references in the Bible.  He gives us
many time references; and when we look at these verses like in Matthew 24:36
and a parallel verse in Mark 13:32 where it says, &ldquo;But of that day and <i>that </i>hour
knoweth no man,&rdquo; we are not disputing this verse at all.  A lot of people think
that we are disputing this verse, but we are not.  These verses were for an
appointed time.  </p>

<p>Throughout the church age, God had told His disciples and
mandated the churches to go into the world and send forth the Gospel.  They
wanted to know about end-time things, and so God said in Acts 1:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or
the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  </p>

<p>The preposition &ldquo;for&rdquo; should have been translated as:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;It is not [<i>of</i>] you to know the times or the seasons&hellip;</p>

<p>Then we read in Acts 1:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
upon you&hellip;  </p>

<p>A lot of people want to read these verses superficially. 
They do not want to search the Bible, and yet God says that we are to compare
Scripture with Scripture.  When we do not do this, the Scriptures become a
snare and a stumbling block to us.  </p>

<p>God has made many promises on judgment in the past and He
has shown us that He is very able and capable of fulfilling His promises.  So
we are going to review some principles that God sets forth.  When we look at
judgments and the different things that God does in the Bible, we are to apply
these principles.    </p>

<p>Let us go to Hebrews 13:8.  Here we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.  </p>

<p>When we read a lot of these historical accounts in the
Bible, God is giving us pictures and portraits of how He would operate in the
future.  So when we are declaring that May 21<sup>st</sup> is Judgment Day,
where are we getting this information from?  </p>

<p>The Bible says that &ldquo;of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man</i>,&rdquo;
but how has God operated in the past?  Has He not revealed His past judgments
to people?  When we examine the Bible, we see that God has always revealed His
past judgments to people.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Amos 3:6-8.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and JEHOVAH hath not done <i>it?</i>
Surely the Lord JEHOVAH will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his
servants the prophets. The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord
JEHOVAH hath spoken, who can but prophesy?  </p>

<p>We can see that God is letting us know in the context of
bringing evil or destruction to a city that He will do nothing until &ldquo;he
revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When we look at these types of verses and when we examine
other passages in the Bible of when God has brought judgments before and when
He has revealed His judgments to His prophets, we can know how God will operate
in the future.  When God is going to bring judgment at the end of the world, we
can know that God is going to reveal these things to us.  So let us examine
some of the past judgments that God has brought upon the people of the world.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Genesis 6:3.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
for that he also <i>is </i>flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years.  </p>

<p>We see here that God has given the time when He would bring
destruction upon man.  He says here that it would be in one hundred and twenty
years.  So He instructed Noah to build this ark.  Noah was a child of God, as
we read in Genesis 6:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">But Noah found grace in the eyes of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>We see here that God gave one hundred and twenty years of
time before He was going to bring destruction upon man.  </p>

<p>The reason for this is what we read in verse 5.  Genesis 6:5
says:    </p>

<p class="verse">And God saw that the wickedness of man <i>was </i>great in the
earth, and <i>that </i>every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i>was </i>only
evil continually.  </p>

<p>One other thing that I want to note is that whenever God has
brought judgment upon man, there was always great wickedness.  We see that in
the early days of creation, man&rsquo;s thoughts were &ldquo;only evil continually.&rdquo;  So
God instructed Noah to build this boat and He gave him one hundred and twenty
years to do so.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 7:4-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I
destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all that JEHOVAH
commanded him. And Noah <i>was </i>six hundred years old when the flood of
waters was upon the earth.  </p>

<p>We see that God gives us another time reference here.  This
was a Biblical reference that was used in the Biblical timeline of history
study that Brother Harold Camping did.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 7:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the six hundredth year of Noah&rsquo;s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month&hellip;  </p>

<p>God has given us this Biblical time reference that He used
to establish the Biblical calendar of history.  </p>

<p>We see here in Genesis 7:4 that God gave Noah a specific
time:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I
destroy from off the face of the earth.  </p>

<p>We know that God fulfilled these prophecies.  When we read
the subsequent verses, we see that the flood waters were brought upon the earth
and that the only souls who got into the ark were the eight souls who were
saved.  Everything that God said that He would do, He fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Genesis 19.  We read in Genesis 19:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing <i>them </i>rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground; And he said, Behold now, my lords,
turn in, I pray you, into your servant&rsquo;s house, and tarry all night, and wash
your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay;
but we will abide in the street all night.  </p>

<p>We see that these two angels were God Himself.  Look at how Lot
greeted them in Genesis 19:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
your servant&rsquo;s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall
rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in
the street all night.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 19:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened
bread, and they did eat. But before they lay down, the men of the city, <i>even
</i>the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
people from every quarter: And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where <i>are
</i>the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we
may know them.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;know&rdquo; is the word that is used in the sense of
intimacy, like when a man knows a woman.  </p>

<p>I have some verses that correspond to this that you can look
at in your spare time.  If you look at Genesis 4:1 and 1 Samuel 1:19, you will be able to get a picture of someone knowing someone in an intimate sense.  </p>

<p>We can see the wickedness of Sodom.  These men wanted to
intimately know the men who were in Lot&rsquo;s house, which is the sin of
homosexuality.  This was also illustrated in the book of Jude where it talks about
the men of Sodom and Gomorrah going after &ldquo;strange flesh.&rdquo;  This is the same
meaning here.  These men wanted to &ldquo;know&rdquo; the men who were in Lot&rsquo;s house.  </p>

<p>Let us skip down to Genesis 19:12.  These men who were
talking to Lot were these two angels who were God Himself.  We read in Genesis
19:12-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
bring <i>them </i>out of this place: For we will destroy this place, because
the cry of them is waxen great before the face of JEHOVAH; and JEHOVAH hath
sent us to destroy it. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for JEHOVAH
will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
</p>

<p>When we bring this message of Judgment Day, we are like Lot. 
We are also seen &ldquo;as one that mocked.&rdquo;  People look at us and they think that
this message of Judgment Day is a joke.  They ask, &ldquo;Where are you getting this
from?&rdquo;  We tell them that we are getting this from the Bible, but we are also
seen like Lot and as people who mock.  </p>

<p>Let us read a little bit more about Lot and his wife where
it talks about God bringing this destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah.  We read in
Genesis 19:23-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Then JEHOVAH rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from
JEHOVAH out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and
all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Genesis 19:26:    </p>

<p class="verse">But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
pillar of salt.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;A pillar of salt&rdquo; is illustrating God&rsquo;s judgment.  Lot&rsquo;s
wife had the appearance of someone who was saved.  It appeared that she was on
her way to salvation.  She was on her way out of the city, but we see that her
heart was still in the city of Sodom.  She turned back when God had instructed
them not to turn back.  We see what happened to her.  She became a &ldquo;pillar of
salt,&rdquo; which is illustrating that she came under the judgment of God.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Exodus 9.  I talked about these verses in
my last study.  We read in Exodus 9:13-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith JEHOVAH God of the Hebrews,
Let my people go, that they may serve me. For I will at this time send all my
plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou
mayest know that <i>there is </i>none like me in all the earth.  </p>

<p>We see here that God is instructing Moses to rise up and
stand before Pharaoh.  Then we read in Exodus 9:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof&hellip;  </p>

<p>We see in this verse that God gave time and judgment.  God
was letting Pharaoh know through Moses that He was going to bring these plagues
upon them if Pharaoh did not take heed to let His people go.  </p>

<p>Let us pick this up in verse 23.  We read in Exodus
9:23-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and JEHOVAH
sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and JEHOVAH
rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled with
the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt
since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt
all that <i>was </i>in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen,
where the children of Israel <i>were, </i>was there no hail.  </p>

<p>So we see that God made a declaration that He was going to
bring judgment upon Pharaoh and that Pharaoh, who was hardened in his heart,
did not take heed.  We also see the consequences of this and that judgment was
brought upon Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants, as His judgment is going to be brought upon
mankind on May 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011 because many will not take heed to God&rsquo;s
warnings.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to the account of Jonah.  So far we see that
when God has made a declaration to bring judgment upon people, He fully brings
the judgment just as He said He would.  We read in Jonah 3:2-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee. So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to
the word of JEHOVAH. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo;
journey. And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried,
and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.  </p>

<p>Jonah did not come with a lot of proofs.  He came with just
a message of judgment.  Then we read in Jonah 3:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why does it not say that the people of Nineveh believed
Jonah?  Jonah was bringing a message from God.  God calls His servants &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo;
because we beseech others on behalf of Christ.  </p>

<p>Jonah 3:5 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.  </p>

<p>This is what we should be doing in our day.  Many people
should be crying out to God.  God has given us the date of May 21<sup>st</sup>. 
Knowing how God has operated in the past, we can know that God is going to
fully fulfill all that He says in His Word.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Jonah 3:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the
violence that <i>is </i>in their hands. Who can tell <i>if </i>God will turn
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?  </p>

<p>God is instructing us to repent.  We know that repentance is
a work on our behalf and any work that we do cannot get us saved.  God
instructed the people to &ldquo;cry mightily unto God.&rdquo;  Then in Jonah 3:9, we read:</p>

<p class="verse">Who can tell&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that their salvation was not because they cried out
to God or due to any works that they did.  We know that this was because God
had saved them.  </p>

<p>God instructs us in Acts 17:30:</p>

<p class="verse">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>

<p>So God is not winking anymore.  The reason for this is what
we read in the next verse, Acts 17:31:</p>

<p class="verse">Because he hath appointed a day&hellip;  </p>

<p>This day is May 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011 when He will judge
the world, so He requires all men everywhere to repent.  </p>

<p>Zephaniah 2:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Seek ye JEHOVAH, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought
his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in
the day of JEHOVAH&rsquo;S anger.  </p>

<p>All the action of salvation is up to God.  It is not by
anything that we do.  God instructs us to believe.  He instructs us to have
faith.  He instructs us to repent, but this is not the true repentance or the
believing unto salvation unless God has saved us.  God must first save us, even
though God instructs us to do these things.  </p>

<p>In the midst of all of these examples that God has given us
in Genesis 7, Genesis 19, Exodus 9, as well as many other passages where God
has given us examples of how He has operated in the past, we would think that
many people would take heed.  However, we see that the people in the churches
still want to hold to the position that Christ is coming as &ldquo;a thief in the
night&rdquo; and that we cannot know the day or the hour.  </p>

<p>We are all familiar with these verses in 1 Thessalonians 5. 
We read in 1 Thessalonians 5:1-2:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that
I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
cometh as a thief in the night.   </p>

<p>This is what the churches are teaching.  They teach that the
Day of the Lord is coming as &ldquo;a thief in the night&rdquo; and that we cannot know the
day or the hour, that we cannot know the timing of Christ&rsquo;s coming.  </p>

<p>It continues in 1 Thessalonians 5:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why are they saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety&rdquo;?  They feel that
they are safe and secure in Christ, and so we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
shall not escape.  </p>

<p>Then in 1 Thessalonians 5:4, He transitions to a new group
of people.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness&hellip;  </p>

<p>So, in essence, what He is saying is that those who believe
that Christ is coming as &ldquo;a thief in the night&rdquo; are &ldquo;in darkness.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
overtake you as a thief.  </p>

<p>This second group of people are not &ldquo;in darkness,&rdquo; so the
Day of the Lord is not going to come upon them as &ldquo;a thief in the night.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we have two groups of people here.  We have one group of
people whom God says &ldquo;sudden destruction cometh upon them.&rdquo;  These are the
people who believe that Christ is coming as &ldquo;a thief in the night.&rdquo;  Then we
have the second group of people from verse 4 who are not in darkness and this
day will not overtake them &ldquo;as a thief.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in 1 Thessalonians 5:5-6:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep&hellip;  </p>

<p>So God says &ldquo;let us not sleep,&rdquo; and then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;as <i>do </i>others&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is talking to those who are not &ldquo;in darkness.&rdquo;  He says, &ldquo;Let
us not sleep.&rdquo;  In essence, He is saying that they are sleeping.  Then He goes
on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but let us watch and be sober.  </p>

<p>This is the second group of people that He is talking to. 
These people are not the ones who are &ldquo;in darkness&rdquo; and this day is not going
to overtake them &ldquo;as a thief.&rdquo;  So He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but let us watch and be sober.  </p>

<p>God instructs us to watch, and we watch by studying God&rsquo;s
Word, by reading God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Revelation 3:3.  God tells us the
consequences for when we are not watching.  There are consequences for not
watching, and we have learned that the people in the churches are not
watching.  So we read in Revelation 3:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know as soon as we read this that there are going to be
certain consequences for not watching, because He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;If therefore thou shalt not watch&hellip;  </p>

<p>We learned in the previous verses of 1 Thessalonians 5 that
God has instructed His people to watch.  He said that His people are not &ldquo;in
darkness&rdquo; and He said to &ldquo;let us watch.&rdquo;  Now He is saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  </p>

<p>This is what will happen for those who are not watching. 
How do we watch?  We watch by studying God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p>The churches want to hold firm to Christ coming as &ldquo;a thief
in the night.&rdquo;  They believe that when Christ comes as &ldquo;a thief in the night,&rdquo;
they will somehow be raptured and that they will receive good blessings.  But
nowhere in the Bible does it say that a thief comes to bring good blessings, as
we read in John 10:10.  In John 10:10, God describes what a thief does.  He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy&hellip;  </p>

<p>This does not sound like a blessing to me at all.  Do you
want to hold to the position that Christ is coming &ldquo;as a thief in the night&rdquo;? 
I do not think that I want to hold to this position at all.  God is crystal
clear as to what a thief does:    </p>

<p class="verse">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy&hellip;  </p>

<p>Let us go to Revelation 16:15.  We read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is </i>he that watcheth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Why is God instructing us to watch?  In many passages, He
continues to tell us to watch.  A lot of emphasis is put on watching.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I come as a thief&hellip;  </p>

<p>Christ is not saying that He is a thief; but when He brings
judgment, His judgment will come &ldquo;as a thief.&rdquo;  However, He will only come &ldquo;as
a thief&rdquo; to those who are not watching.  The emphasis is on watching.  </p>

<p>Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed&hellip;</p>

<p>There are blessings that come along with watching.  He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Blessed <i>is </i>he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments,
lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  </p>

<p>So we see great blessings for those who are watching.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to a verse that tells us of more consequences
for those who are not watching.  We read in Proverbs 29:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved [<i>or chastened</i>] hardeneth <i>his
</i>neck, shall suddenly be destroyed&hellip; </p>

<p>This is referring to that &ldquo;sudden destruction&rdquo; that we read
about in 1 Thessalonians 5:3.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his </i>neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.  </p>

<p>We know that they shall not escape.  They will be &ldquo;without
remedy,&rdquo; so they shall not escape.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Ecclesiastes 8:5, which is a familiar passage. 
It says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.  </p>

<p>This is referring to a true believer.  The reason for God
referring to them as being wise is because God has given them a new heart. 
When God has given someone a new heart, He refers to them as &ldquo;wise.&rdquo;  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;a wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.  </p>

<p>In discerning, he will know both time and judgment.  God
says that His people will know time and judgment.  </p>

<p>In Daniel 12, God talks about the wise man again.  We read
in Daniel 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even
</i>to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.  </p>

<p>We see that it is just incredible how God is opening up the
Scriptures.  We are learning truth and we are seeing how all of Scripture is
tying in and harmonizing together.  </p>

<p>So He says in Daniel 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;knowledge shall be increased.  </p>

<p>Then He says in Daniel 12:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are </i>closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white,
and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand; but the wise shall understand.  </p>

<p>The wise will understand because when God saves them, He
puts His Spirit within them.  Like He says in Amos 3:7, God is not going to do
anything until &ldquo;he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us go to Matthew 24:38-39.  These are familiar
passages.  We read in Matthew 24:38:  </p>

<p class="verse">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark,  </p>

<p>We see that in the days before the flood, life was going on
as normal for most of the people.  </p>

<p>As we prophesy of May 21<sup>st</sup> of 2011, we can relate
to how life is going on as normal for a lot of people.  People are scoffing and
mocking at May 21<sup>st</sup> and they are not paying it any mind.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Matthew 24:39:  </p>

<p class="verse">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>We read in the preceding verses of Matthew 24, in Matthew
24:36-37:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no <i>man, </i>no, not the
angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of Noe <i>were, </i>so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>So God is instructing us to go back to the account of Noah. 
When we go back to the account of Noah, did Noah know a precise date and a
precise time?  Yes, he did; yet we read again in Matthew 24:39:  </p>

<p class="verse">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  </p>

<p>Did they know?  Of course they knew.  They knew because Noah
had prophesied to them.  Noah was &ldquo;a preacher of righteousness.&rdquo;  God does not
give us all of the details, but we can know that Noah was warning these
people.  </p>

<p>It says that they &ldquo;knew not.&rdquo;  Why does it say that they &ldquo;knew
not&rdquo;?  Most people will jump on this verse and say, &ldquo;Look!  The Bible says that
they did not know.&rdquo;  They were told, just like we are going out and warning
people, but they &ldquo;knew not&rdquo; because it did not impact their lives; they did not
react to it.  So some people who want to approach the Bible with skepticism
will grab this verse and say, &ldquo;Look!  They did not know,&rdquo; but we know that they
knew because Noah, as a preacher of righteousness, would have been warning the
people.  </p>

<p>Then we see a picture of salvation in Matthew 24:40-41:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
other left. Two <i>women shall be</i> grinding at the mill; the one shall be
taken, and the other left.  </p>

<p>Then again in Matthew 24:42, God emphasizes that we are to
watch.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
</p>

<p>Because we did not know the hour when the Lord &ldquo;doth come,&rdquo;
and so He instructed us to watch.  He said, &ldquo;Watch therefore.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Revelation 3:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  </p>

<p>So God is instructing us here in Matthew 24:42 to watch:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.  </p>

<p>Go now to verse 48.  Matthew 24:48-50 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
delayeth his coming; And shall begin to smite <i>his</i> fellowservants, and to
eat and drink with the drunken; The lord of that servant shall come in a day
when he looketh not for <i>him</i>, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  </p>

<p>God says that if the servant begins to &ldquo;eat and drink with
the drunken&rdquo;:  </p>

<p class="verse">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not
for <i>him</i>&hellip;  </p>

<p>But God&rsquo;s people are looking.  They are watching.  God, by
His mercy, has revealed this end-time date to us so that we could cry out to
Him.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Mark 13:32, which is a parallel verse to
Matthew 24:36.  We read in Mark 13:32:  </p>

<p class="verse">But of that day and <i>that </i>hour knoweth no man, no, not the
angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.  </p>

<p>We know that this reference to &ldquo;the son&rdquo; cannot be referring
to Christ.  Christ said, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&rdquo;  Christ
also said, &ldquo;I and <i>my</i> Father are one.&rdquo;  So we know that this reference to
&ldquo;the son&rdquo; cannot be Christ.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Mark 13:33:  </p>

<p class="verse">Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
</p>

<p>Then we see in Mark 13:34 that God sets a watchman:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>For the Son of man is </i>as a man taking a far journey, who
left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work,
and commanded the porter to watch.  </p>

<p>God is commanding and emphasizing that we are &ldquo;to watch.&rdquo; 
Then we read in Mark 13:35-36:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest
coming suddenly he find you sleeping.  </p>

<p>Or find you &ldquo;in darkness,&rdquo; like we read in 1 Thessalonians 5
where He said, &ldquo;Let us not sleep.&rdquo;  When Christ was in the garden of
Gethsemane, He used this same illustration when He told Peter and the other
disciples to watch when they were falling asleep.  I do not know if it is in the
exact same context, but it is similar when He told His disciples, &ldquo;Could ye not
watch with me one hour?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So He says in Mark 13:35-37:  </p>

<p class="verse">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest
coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all,
Watch.  </p>

<p>Why is God telling us to watch?  He keeps emphasizing that
we are to watch.  Why would we set a watchman in a tower?  Who sets a watchman
in a tower when the enemy is coming and tells him, &ldquo;Do not tell us when the
enemy is approaching.  We will be ready when the enemy comes upon us without
you telling us this&rdquo;?  Who sets a dog as a watchdog if there is no reason to
watch?  There is a verse in Jeremiah where God is talking about the churches
and their watchmen where He refers to them as &ldquo;dumb dogs, they cannot bark&rdquo; [<i>note:
speaker inadvertently referred to Jeremiah, but the verse is Isaiah 56:10</i>]. 
Who is going to have a dog that cannot warn them of an invasion or of someone
approaching to cause them harm?  </p>

<p>God sets the watchmen for what purpose?  We are to watch by
reading the Bible.  In Ezekiel 33, God is instructing us to warn the people. 
How are we going to warn the people about judgment if we do not know when
judgment is going to happen?  God is instructing us to warn the people and this
is what God&rsquo;s people are going to do.  </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people are very busy going on tract trips.  God is
using every means.  The Internet has become a very powerful tool that God has
used mankind to create.  This is a very powerful means by which we can speak to
people on the other side of the earth.  </p>

<p>In older days, if you wanted to get a message to someone,
you would have to send it by way of a horse or something like this, which might
have taken a week or two.  But now God has blessed us with the technology that
we have where we are able to reach people in China through shortwave radio. 
Several people here today have signs on their shirts.  God&rsquo;s people are going
out and blowing the trumpet and God&rsquo;s will will be done.  </p>

<p>Let us close here.  </p>
