<p>Please turn to John 9.  We read in John 9:1-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as <i>Jesus </i>passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
<i>his </i>birth. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,
this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath
this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made
manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the
light of the world. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made
clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, And
said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation,
Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. The neighbours
therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not
this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is he: others <i>said, </i>He is
like him: <i>but </i>he said, I am <i>he.</i> Therefore said they unto him, How
were thine eyes opened? He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made
clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and
wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>

<p>This is another account of Christ causing a man who had been
blind from birth to see.  </p>

<p>We all know that, spiritually, this is a picture of
salvation, and we will look at that, but we are going to look at these verses at
the end of this chapter also, especially where we read in John 9:40:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>some </i>of the Pharisees which were with him&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to Christ.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  </p>

<p>And we will also look at verse 41, John 9:41:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:
but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.  </p>

<p>In the beginning of this chapter, the disciples had asked
Christ:  </p>

<p class="verse">Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born
blind?  </p>

<p>We just naturally want to think &ldquo;works.&rdquo;  But Christ
answered them:  </p>

<p class="verse">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the
works of God should be made manifest in him.  </p>

<p>It is taught in many places in the Bible that children do
not suffer for the sins of the parents, or vice versa.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Ezekiel 18:20-23 where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son:
the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the
wicked shall be upon him. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he
hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath
committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he
hath done he shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?
saith the Lord JEHOVAH: <i>and </i>not that he should return from his ways, and
live?</p>

<p>Or look at Deuteronomy 5:9.  This is part of the Ten Commandments. 
We will start in Deuteronomy 5:8 where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not make thee <i>any </i>graven image, <i>or </i>any
likeness <i>of any thing </i>that <i>is </i>in heaven above, or that <i>is </i>in
the earth beneath, or that <i>is </i>in the waters beneath the earth:.</p>

<p>Then Deuteronomy 5:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I
JEHOVAH thy God <i>am </i>a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation </i>of them that hate
me,  </p>

<p>This statement is not saying that God judges the children
for the sins of the fathers.  It is saying that He judges the children unto the
third and fourth generation<i> </i>of the children that hate Him.  That is what
this is saying.  </p>

<p>Look at Deuteronomy 23:3-4 where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of
JEHOVAH; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
congregation of JEHOVAH for ever: Because they met you not with bread and with
water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.</p>

<p>Again, this is not saying that judgment will come on the
Ammonites and the Moabites until the tenth generation, because here God is
giving us something different.  He is giving us a spiritual picture.  </p>

<p>The Ammonites and the Moabites were descendants of Abraham. 
In them, we see a picture of the corporate church today.  They were descendants
of Abraham and yet they tried to hinder the Israelites from entering into the
Promised Land, which is like those who are in the church today.  Those who were
blood descendants of Abraham, the Israel of God, as it were, were really trying
to hinder salvation.  </p>

<p>In Luke 11:52, Christ said:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, lawyers!&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to those who were supposed to be teaching
the Law of God.  Continuing in Luke 11:52-53:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered. And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees
began to urge <i>him </i>vehemently&hellip;  </p>

<p>They knew what He was saying to them.  </p>

<p>Again, the principle here in John 9:2 is that the children
do not suffer for the sins of the parents, because John 9:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  </p>

<p>Christ worked these miracles to show a couple of things.  He
worked these miracles to show that He was God Himself and that He had the power
to do these things, which were a picture of salvation.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Matthew 9:1-2 where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
own city. And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a
bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of
good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  </p>

<p>They brought this man who had the palsy before Him, and yet
He did not heal him.  Instead, He said:  </p>

<p class="verse">Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  </p>

<p>He forgave his sins.  Then we read in Matthew 9:3:  </p>

<p class="verse">And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This
<i>man </i>blasphemeth.  </p>

<p>They said this because Jesus had said that He was forgiving
this man&rsquo;s sins.  Then Matthew 9:4-5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
in your hearts? For whether is easier, to say, <i>Thy </i>sins be forgiven
thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  </p>

<p>But look at Matthew 9:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed,
and go unto thine house.  </p>

<p>Then He healed him to show that He was the Son of God and
that He had the power to do this.  </p>

<p>Back in John 9, Christ goes on in John 9:4 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work.  </p>

<p>We have just found out very recently that this &ldquo;night&rdquo; that
He speaks of in this verse begins on May 21 of 2011 when Christ comes and takes
His elect from this world, which is when there will be no more light of the
Gospel in this world.  What a horrible thing to contemplate!  </p>

<p>Then in John 9:5, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  </p>

<p>This does not mean that when He went back to Heaven that
there was no more light in the world, because, again, His whole ministry was
just a parable.  This is something else that we are learning.  His whole
ministry was a parable.  </p>

<p>If we look at John 16, Christ is speaking to the disciples
about going to the cross.  Again, this was a parable, a demonstration of what
He had to suffer to gain the salvation of His people.  In John 16:7-16, He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that
I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is speaking of the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit comes to
us and indwells us upon salvation.  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come,
he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of
sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to my
Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is
judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit
when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he
shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that </i>shall he
speak: and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall
receive of mine, and shall show <i>it </i>unto you. All things that the Father
hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show <i>it
</i>unto you. A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.  </p>

<p>Again, this was all a parable.  We know that all through
time whenever a person was saved, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, would come
and indwell that person.  But here, this is just being demonstrated in 33 A.D. 
</p>

<p>So Christ, in His Spirit, is in the world until that day,
until that horrible day that begins on May 21 in 2011.  </p>

<p>Back here in John 9:6, we will now read about Him giving
sight to this blind man.  John 9:6-7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, And said
unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.)
He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.  </p>

<p>First we read that He spit on the ground.  This is kind of a
gross thing to contemplate.  I have a weak stomach and cannot think about these
kinds of things too much, but to spit in the Bible is associated with the
curse.  There are a couple of different places in the ceremonial law where we
read that if an unclean person spit on a clean person then that clean person
was made unclean until the evening.  </p>

<p>This was a picture of being under the wrath or under the
curse of God.  So we read that He spit on the ground, and, again, we are
integrally associated with the ground, with the dust of this earth.  </p>

<p>In Genesis 2:7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH God formed man <i>of </i>the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  </p>

<p>We are very closely associated with the ground, with the
dust of this ground.  </p>

<p>Then in Genesis 3:17, after Adam and Eve ate of that tree,
we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <i>is </i>the ground for thy sake; in
sorrow shalt thou eat <i>of </i>it all the days of thy life;  </p>

<p>This ground, this world, became cursed because of the sin of
man.  </p>

<p>As far as what we are reading in John 9, Mr. Camping worked
through this awhile back.  I do not remember exactly what he said, but I think
that what we have to see in this is that when Christ spit on the ground and
made that clay, we see the curse on the ground, on the dust of the ground, and
I believe we have to see Christ in this.  </p>

<p>Turn to Philippians 2:5-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who,
being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made
himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made
in the likeness of men: </p>

<p>He then became clay as we are.  </p>

<p class="verse">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also
hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <i>things </i>in heaven, and <i>things
</i>in earth, and <i>things </i>under the earth;  </p>

<p>He was &ldquo;<b>made in the likeness of men</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>found in
fashion as a man</b>,&rdquo; and we know from Galatians that He was &ldquo;<b>made a curse
for us</b>&rdquo; so that those who will be given eternal life could enter into God&rsquo;s
Heaven.  Christ became a curse.  I believe that this is what we are to see here
in John 9:7 when Christ spits on the ground, makes this clay, and then anoints
the eyes of this man with this clay.  </p>

<p>We also read this word &ldquo;clay&rdquo; in Romans 9:21.  Again, this
just associates man with that clay.  In Romans 9:21, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  </p>

<p>This is speaking to unsaved man as he reacts to the
sovereignty of God in salvation.  God anticipated the way man will not like His
sovereignty in salvation.  </p>

<p class="verse">Hath not the potter&hellip;  </p>

<p>God is the &ldquo;potter.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto
honour, and another unto dishonour?  </p>

<p>But again, back here in John 9, I believe that we are to see
Christ under the curse.  Christ is the Gospel, and the eyes of this man were
anointed with that Gospel.  Then he went and he washed in the &ldquo;<b>pool of
Siloam</b>,&rdquo; and God tells us what this word &ldquo;Siloam&rdquo; means.  He says, &ldquo;<b>which
is by interpretation, Sent</b>.&rdquo;  The Greek work that God gives us in John 9 is
the word that we get the word &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; from.  We know that Christ is spoken of
as &ldquo;<b>the Apostle</b>&rdquo; in Hebrews.  He was The One who was sent.  </p>

<p>Hebrews 3:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;  </p>

<p>We are, as it were, apostles.  Upon salvation, we are given
the commission to take this Gospel of salvation into the world.  </p>

<p>But this man&rsquo;s eyes were anointed with this clay, which I believe
was a representation of Christ under the curse.  This is where our salvation
comes from, that our eyes would be anointed with this clay so that we would
see.  </p>

<p>Look at Luke 7:22.  This is where John the Baptist questions
whether or not Christ is the Messiah.  We will start in Luke 7:19.  This is also
when John the Baptist had been put in jail.  We read in Luke 7:19-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And John calling <i>unto him </i>two of his disciples sent <i>them
</i>to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? When
the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee,
saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? And in that same
hour he cured many of <i>their </i>infirmities and plagues, and of evil
spirits; and unto many <i>that were </i>blind he gave sight. Then Jesus
answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen
and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.  </p>

<p>This is all speaking of the salvation of God.  </p>

<p>So we read here in John 9:7 that this man:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;went his way therefore, and <span class="underline">washed</span>, and came seeing.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;washed&rdquo; is not the word for &ldquo;baptized.&rdquo;  This is
the word that is used in John 13 where Christ washes the feet of the
disciples.  Peter wanted Him to wash his whole body, his hands and his feet
also.  Then we read in John 13:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to <span class="underline">wash</span>
<i>his </i>feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.  </p>

<p>Again, this washing speaks of the washing away of our sins
by the water of the Word in salvation.  </p>

<p>Going back to John 9, we see in John 9:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is
he: others <i>said, </i>He is like him: <i>but </i>he said, I am <i>he.</i> </p>

<p>They ask him how his sight was given to him and he tells
them.  Then they take him to the Pharisees, and then we read in John 9:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  </p>

<p>We can imagine what was going on here because an
unbelievable thing had happened.  Everybody was excited and they wanted to show
this man to everyone, but then we read in John 9:14-16:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
his eyes. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he
keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do
such miracles? And there was a division among them.  </p>

<p>The Pharisees were offended and found fault with Christ
because Christ had done this on the Sabbath day.  They had not read Isaiah 58
in which Isaiah, anticipating the New Testament Sabbath, is speaking of what
the Sabbath day is all about.  In the Ten Commandments, we are given the
commandment to observe the Sabbath because it is looking at the salvation God,
that it is entirely by the work of God and by none of our work.  In Isaiah
58:13-14, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <i>from </i>doing
thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
JEHOVAH, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor
finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <i>thine own </i>words: Then shalt
thou delight thyself in JEHOVAH; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high
places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for
the mouth of JEHOVAH hath spoken <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>He is speaking of fasting back in verse 6 of Isaiah 58,
which is actually what we are to be doing on the Sabbath day.  In Isaiah 58:6-7,
He says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Is </i>not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the
bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
free, and that ye break every yoke?<i> Is it </i>not to deal thy bread to the
hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, these are all figures of salvation.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou
hide not thyself from thine own flesh?  </p>

<p>This was exactly what Christ was doing in John 9 on the
Sabbath day.  They did not see it; they were blind to this.  Instead, they were
finding fault with Him.  </p>

<p>The Pharisees then took this man to his parents, and then we
read in John 9:20-22:  </p>

<p class="verse">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
son, and that he was born blind: But by what means he now seeth, we know not;
or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak
for himself. These <i>words </i>spake his parents, because they feared the
Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was
Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  </p>

<p>Then they went back to the man again in verse 24.  They
would not quit!  John 9:24-33 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto
him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. He answered and
said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no, </i>I know not: one thing I know, that,
whereas I was blind, now I see. Then said they to him again, What did he to
thee? how opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and
ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it </i>again? will ye also be his
disciples? Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are
Moses&rsquo; disciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for </i>this <i>fellow,
</i>we know not from whence he is. The man answered and said unto them, Why
herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet </i>he
hath opened mine eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man
be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world
began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  </p>

<p>Look at how they were offended.  Look at their pride in John
9:34:  </p>

<p class="verse">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  </p>

<p>Look now at John 7:45-49.  This is speaking of Christ:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? The officers answered, Never
man spake like this man. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also
deceived? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? But this
people who knoweth not the law are cursed.  </p>

<p>We can see the pride of these men who were supposed to be
the spiritual rulers over Israel.  They were supposed to be the ones who were
teaching them out of the Law.  </p>

<p>Again, this is looking at the church of our day.  This is a
terrible thing to contemplate.  We certainly cannot be disdainful nor have
contempt for those in the church today.  It is only by God&rsquo;s mercy if He opens
anyone&rsquo;s eyes, but we are to see the church today in those Jews back then in
their blindness.  </p>

<p>Then in John 9:35-39, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and
said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him,
Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said,
Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. And Jesus said, For judgment I am come
into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see
might be made blind.  </p>

<p>We see here the principle of &ldquo;<b>many <i>that are </i>first
shall be last; and the last <i>shall be </i>first</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 9:40-41:  </p>

<p class="verse">And <i>some </i>of the Pharisees which were with him heard these
words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? Jesus said unto them, If ye were
blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin
remaineth.  </p>

<p>Again, this is a greater sin among those who have the rule
over God&rsquo;s people and should be teaching them.  When they think that they see
but do not, they are deceived.  He told them:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;therefore your sin remaineth.  </p>

<p>Christ is telling them that if they were blind and like
these common people whom Christ came to save, then they would not have this
sin.  Again, we see how this relates to the pride in the church of our day.  </p>

<p>Turn back to Isaiah 29 and look at all of the principles
that we have just spoken of that show up here in this passage.  Isaiah 29 is a
well-known passage.  God is speaking about how He is going to judge Israel for
turning their backs on Him, for despising His Word, for turning the people to
idols, for teaching works gospels, for their blindness.  In Isaiah 29:13, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near <i>me
</i>with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me&hellip;  </p>

<p>They are honoring Him with &ldquo;<b>feigned lips</b>,&rdquo; as we read
in Psalm 17.  Psalm 17:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Hear the right, O JEHOVAH, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
prayer, <i>that goeth </i>not out of feigned lips.  </p>

<p>We should constantly be examining ourselves against the Word
of God &ldquo;<b>to make [<i>our</i>] calling and election sure</b>,&rdquo; making sure
that we are not calling on the Lord or praising Him with &ldquo;<b>feigned lips</b>.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>Let us go back to Isaiah 29:13.  We read in Isaiah
29:13-16:   </p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near <i>me
</i>with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their
heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:  </p>

<p>Again, we see this today.  Men are changing the Bible.  They
are diminishing the importance of the Bible.  They are bringing in works.  They
are introducing their own precepts into the Word of God.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: Therefore,
behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, <i>even </i>a
marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise <i>men </i>shall
perish, and the understanding of their prudent <i>men </i>shall be hid. Woe
unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from JEHOVAH, and their works
are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? Surely your
turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&rsquo;s clay&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are clay.  We are &ldquo;<b>the potter&rsquo;s clay</b>.&rdquo;  He is
going back to that principle.  Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or
shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?  </p>

<p>This is exactly what these Pharisees were saying about Christ
in John 9, &ldquo;He has no understanding&mdash;who is this man?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then Isaiah 29:17-19 says:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Is </i>it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be
turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a
forest? And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes
of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. The meek also
shall increase <i>their </i>joy in JEHOVAH, and the poor among men shall
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.  </p>

<p>The last verse of John 9 is a convicting verse.  John 9:41 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:
but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.  </p>

<p>Again, we must examine ourselves and put away our pride and
just continue to seek God for His mercy and for His understanding.  </p>

<p>Shall we pray.  Heavenly Father, again we come before You. 
Could it be that our words have glorified You and You alone in Your salvation. 
If we have made any error here or if we have not expounded correctly or if we could
have said something better, we know that You will forgive.  We know that in
Your mercy, we cannot harm the true believers, Your elect.  We know that in
Your mercy, it still is the Day of Salvation.  We just thank You for this and
ask that we could be Your servants and that each one of us could have a heart
to continue to take this Gospel of salvation and this message of impending
judgment to the world, knowing that through this, You will continue to save
until that last day.  May it all be to Your praise and to Your glory.  We pray
this in Jesus&rsquo; Name.  Amen.  </p>
