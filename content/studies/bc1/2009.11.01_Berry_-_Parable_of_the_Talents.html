<p>Please turn to Matthew 25 where we will start at verse 14. 
This is the parable of the talents.  This parable is familiar to almost anyone who
has any knowledge of the Bible.  We have always understood that this parable
was speaking of the ability that God has entrusted to man to use.  Finally when
He comes back, He takes account of those who were commissioned to serve Him in
order to see what fruits they have borne.  </p>

<p>I, myself, have never quite understood some of the things
about the man who was given the one talent.  I have never understood some of
the things that he said or some of the things that the Lord said unto him.  By
the mercy of God, I hope that I understand a little bit now and that I might
speak on this.  </p>

<p>So let me start reading in verse 14 of Matthew 25.  Matthew
25:14-30 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is </i>as a man travelling into a
far country, <i>who </i>called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;
to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his
journey. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the
same, and made <i>them </i>other five talents. And likewise he that <i>had
received </i>two, he also gained other two. But he that had received one went
and digged in the earth, and hid his lord&rsquo;s money. After a long time the lord
of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. And so he that had received
five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five
talents more. His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou </i>good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. He also that had received two
talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I
have gained two other talents beside them. His lord said unto him, Well done,
good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. Then he
which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou
art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou
hast not strowed: And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
lo, <i>there </i>thou hast <i>that is </i>thine. His lord answered and said
unto him, <i>Thou </i>wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap
where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strowed: Thou oughtest therefore
to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then </i>at my coming I should
have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent from him, and give
<i>it </i>unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall
be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be
taken away even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  </p>

<p>Matthew 25 is simply a continuation of what theologians call
the Olivet Discourse, which was after Christ made His triumphal entry when He
came into Jerusalem and went into the temple.  At the end of the day, He went
out and began to speak about the end of the world and about the condition of
those who would claim to be His people at the end, which carries over into the
next chapter.  I do not believe that there were chapters in the original manuscripts. 
</p>

<p>He begins in Matthew 25 with this parable of the ten
virgins, which is speaking of the church, those in the church or those who
claim to be the people of God when He comes in judgment.  We know that five of
these virgins were saved and that five of them were foolish.  A virgin in the
Bible is a picture of someone who is supposed to be a child of God.  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to give this parable of the talents, which
is speaking of the same thing.  This is speaking of when He returns and it has
to do with the condition of those who claim to be His people.  Two of these
three men have borne fruit and the other one has not.  After that, He gives
this parable about the Lord coming in judgment and how He separates the sheep
from the goats.  He puts the goats at His left hand and the sheep at His right
hand, the sheep being representative of those who have eternal life.  The goats
on His left hand are representative of those who did not feed Him when He was
hungry or clothe Him when He was naked, etc., which are figures of bringing the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>We know that goats are clean animals, also.  The goats and
the sheep are clean animals.  The Israelites could offer a goat or they could
eat a goat for their Passover dinner, so these are people who are supposed to
be clean animals in the church and yet they are set at His left hand and are
not saved.  </p>

<p>So let us look at this parable of the talents.  We read in
Matthew 25:14:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is </i>as a man travelling into a
far country, <i>who </i>called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.  </p>

<p>There are several parables in the Bible that speak of a
householder or a man who entrusts his goods, his possessions, to his servants
and then goes into a far country.  We are seeing in this that the Lord is
visiting His people and entrusting them with the Gospel and commissioning them
to take that Gospel into the world.  Then He goes into a far country and then
returns to see what fruit they have borne.  </p>

<p>For instance, we read in Mark 13:34-37:  </p>

<p class="verse"><i>For the Son of man is </i>as a man taking a far journey, who
left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work,
and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the
master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or
in the morning: Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto
you I say unto all, Watch.  </p>

<p>This is commanding those who are His people to watch.  We
are to watch and we watch in His Word.  This is where we watch and learn about
the Lord and about His coming.  </p>

<p>So let us go back again to Matthew 25:14, but we may also
look at Luke 19 because there is a parable that is very similar to this in Luke
19.  It has just a couple of differences and we speak about this a little bit. 
Again, Matthew 25:14 says: </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is </i>as a man travelling into a
far country, <i>who </i>called his <span class="underline">own</span> servants&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;own&rdquo; suggests &ldquo;separated&rdquo; and &ldquo;apart.&rdquo;  They are &ldquo;<b>his
own servants</b>.&rdquo;  Actually, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament were to
be God&rsquo;s servants.  They were to be a representation of His body, His physical
body, as the people of God.  </p>

<p>Let us look at John 1:11.  This is speaking of those who are
supposed to be &ldquo;<b>his own</b>.&rdquo;  In John 1:11, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">He came unto his <span class="underline">own</span>, and his own received him not.  </p>

<p>This is the same word.  It is speaking of those who were
supposed to be &ldquo;<b>his own</b>,&rdquo; and yet not all of them were His children.  </p>

<p>Again, we read in Matthew 25:14 that the man:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;called his own servants, and delivered unto them his <span class="underline">goods</span>. 
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<b>His goods</b>&rdquo; would be the Gospel, the Gospel of
salvation, which He entrusts to His people.  His people are given the
commission to take that Gospel into the world so that the Lord will work
through it and the fruit will be brought forth.  </p>

<p>Let us look at one verse with this same Greek word that was
translated as &ldquo;goods.&rdquo;  In Luke 12:41-44, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
us, or even to all? And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
whom <i>his </i>lord shall make ruler over his household, to give <i>them their
</i>portion of meat in due season? Blessed <i>is </i>that servant, whom his
lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you, that he
will make him ruler over all <span class="underline">that he hath</span>.</p>

<p>This is the word that was translated as &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in Matthew
25.  We know that this is speaking of a &ldquo;<b>faithful servant</b>,&rdquo; which is
speaking of Christ in the first instance, and &ldquo;<b>all that he hath</b>&rdquo; in Luke
 12:44 really refers to the Kingdom of God.  So the &ldquo;goods&rdquo; here in Matthew
25:14 are really speaking of the Kingdom of God, of the Gospel that is
entrusted to God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 25:15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
another one; to every man according to his <span class="underline">several</span> ability&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that God gives people different abilities.  This
word &ldquo;several&rdquo; is the same word that was translated &ldquo;own&rdquo; in Matthew 25:14. 
This word &ldquo;ability&rdquo; is the Greek word <i>dunamis</i>.  For any of us who have
spent any time in the Word, this is the word for &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; and it is translated
as &ldquo;mighty&rdquo; and &ldquo;power&rdquo; very often and it is speaking of the power of the Lord
to save.  </p>

<p>Again, Matthew 25:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
another one; to every man according to his several ability&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or the mighty power of the Lord working in him.  </p>

<p>Then we read in verse 16, Matthew 25:16:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made <i>them </i>other five talents.  </p>

<p>I believe that it is obvious to see here that this person
has taken what the Lord has entrusted him with and gone out and brought forth
fruit.  </p>

<p>Then Matthew 25:17 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And likewise he that <i>had received </i>two, he also gained
other two.  </p>

<p>But now in Matthew 25:18, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord&rsquo;s money.  </p>

<p>He begins speaking of talents that were entrusted to these
men.  A talent is simply an amount, a weight, but now He has changed the word
and used a word for silver or money.  Again, this is something that is
representative of the Gospel.  So we read that this man:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;went and digged in the earth, and <span class="underline">hid</span> his lord&rsquo;s money. 
</p>

<p>He digged in this cursed earth and he hid it.  This word &ldquo;hid&rdquo;
speaks of concealing, a concealing from anyone to see and we will see a
spiritual picture in this.  </p>

<p>Let us look at Matthew 11:25 where we see the same word.  In
Matthew 11:25, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast <span class="underline">hid</span> these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;hid&rdquo; is the same word.  This is the sovereignty of God
in election.  He has hid the things that are to be known about His Kingdom.  He
has hid the mystery of the Gospel &ldquo;<b>from the wise and prudent</b>,&rdquo; from
those who are wise in this world, and He has &ldquo;<b>revealed them unto babes</b>.&rdquo; 
Those who are saved come to the Lord as babes, as children knowing nothing. 
But the Lord is hid and He has hid this from the wise of this world, and that
is the same word that we find in Matthew 25:18.  This man in his wickedness hid
the Gospel of salvation.  He did not work with it at all.  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 25:19, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
reckoneth with them.  </p>

<p>To &ldquo;reckon&rdquo; means to &ldquo;settle the account.&rdquo;  This is speaking
of the Lord coming back in judgment.  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 25:20, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I
have gained beside them five talents more.  </p>

<p>The Lord commends this man.  This man has borne fruit.  </p>

<p>Then Matthew 25:21 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou </i>good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  </p>

<p>We do not know how this is physically going to work out in
the Kingdom of Heaven.  There are those who teach rewards in the Gospel and
that is a terrible teaching really.  None of us deserve salvation.  </p>

<p>Then we go on to read in Matthew 25:22-25:  </p>

<p class="verse">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside
them. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast
been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter
thou into the joy of thy lord. Then he which had received the one talent came
and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strowed: And I was afraid, and went
and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there </i>thou hast <i>that is </i>thine. 
</p>

<p>This man knows the Lord.  It is not like he is some heathen
out there.  So what we are to see in this man is that those in the church are
just like the Israelites in the Old Testament who were given the Law.  The Lord
brought them out of Egypt, sustained them in the wilderness for forty years,
gave them the Law by which they were to know all about this salvation, and they
were to be the representatives of the Kingdom of God on this earth.  He came
down on Mount Sinai where they actually knew that He was present.  They feared
Him greatly.  </p>

<p>However, we read here in Matthew 25:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an hard man&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is a man who has learned this because he has heard the
Gospel and he fears, but it is not a fear unto salvation.  </p>

<p>Let us look at this word &ldquo;hard&rdquo; first:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an <span class="underline">hard</span> man&hellip;  </p>

<p>In James 3:4, we see this same word translated as &ldquo;fierce&rdquo;: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Behold also the ships, which though <i>they be </i>so great, and
<i>are </i>driven of <span class="underline">fierce</span> winds, yet are they turned about with a very
small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;fierce&rdquo; is that same word that was translated as &ldquo;hard&rdquo;
in Matthew 25:24.  This is speaking of the judgment of the Lord.  In Matthew
25:24, this is speaking of a &ldquo;strict and severe man.&rdquo;  In the Luke 19 account,
they use the word &ldquo;austere,&rdquo; which is the Greek word <i>austeros</i> and it is
where we get our English word &ldquo;austere&rdquo; from.  Again, it is in the same sense,
that He is a fierce Lord, a strict Man, a God of judgment.  This man knew
that.  He has heard the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Then this man goes on to say in Matthew 25:24:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou
hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strowed:  </p>

<p>In other words, he has heard the Word.  He has heard a verse
like Isaiah 65:1.  In Isaiah 65:1, the Lord says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I am sought of <i>them that </i>asked not <i>for me; </i>I am
found of <i>them that </i>sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
nation <i>that </i>was not called by my name.  </p>

<p>Most of the later chapters of Isaiah speak about how the
Gospel is going to go outside of the nation of Israel to the heathen nations
and that He is going to give up the nation of Israel.  Again, we see this when Christ
came.  When He went to the cross in 33 A.D., He entirely separated Himself from
the nation of Israel.  Again, we see this now because we know that the church
age ended in May of 1988 when God gave up that corporate body that is a
representative of Him on this earth.  He took His spirit out of the church and
He is not working through the church anymore.  </p>

<p>So we read in Matthew 25:24 that He is:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast
not strowed:  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the sovereignty of God in salvation and
in judgment.  Again, this man knows this and he was afraid.  This man says in
Matthew 25:25:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I was afraid&hellip;  </p>

<p>The unsaved of this world have a fear.  They have a fear of
God, but it is not a fear unto salvation.  They mask it or they hide it or they
are in denial.  They take up atheism or they simply just push God out of their
minds and any thoughts of God, or they go to a false gospel that comforts them
and tells them what they want to hear.  </p>

<p>Turn to Romans 8.  Romans 8:13-14 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are
led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  </p>

<p>But Romans 8:15 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  </p>

<p>The unsaved have a fear.  </p>

<p>Look at Hebrews 2.  In Hebrews 2:14-15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  </p>

<p>The unsaved have a fear of death but they are &ldquo;<b>subject to
bondage</b>.&rdquo;  They are still in an unsaved state.  </p>

<p>Now look at 1 John 4:15-18, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that
God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in
love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that
feareth is not made perfect in love.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;<b>perfect love</b>&rdquo; of the Lord in salvation &ldquo;<b>casteth
out fear</b>.&rdquo;  &ldquo;<b>He that feareth</b>,&rdquo; and this man fears, has the fear that
is not unto salvation.  </p>

<p>Then 1 John 4:17 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have <span class="underline">boldness</span>
in the day of judgment&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;boldness&rdquo; is sometimes translated &ldquo;confidence.&rdquo; 
When the Lord finally comes, God&rsquo;s elect are not going to have fear.  They are
going to have confidence.  They are going to be looking up because their &ldquo;<b>redemption
draweth nigh</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us go back to Matthew 25 again.  In Matthew 25:25, we
read where the man says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>He did not do anything with that Gospel that was entrusted
to him.  He thought that he was okay and is simply returning back at least what
was given to him.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Matthew 25:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou </i>wicked and
slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where
I have not strowed:  </p>

<p>Then in Matthew 25:27, He says something very strange.  He
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
and <i>then </i>at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Usury&rdquo; is like &ldquo;interest.&rdquo;  He should have taken this money
and put it into the bank.  At least he would have received interest on this
money.  We think of this as something sinful; but according to God, this is an
acceptable thing to do in business.  If you do this honestly, it is alright to
collect interest.  </p>

<p>So He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the <span class="underline">exchangers</span>&hellip; 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;exchangers&rdquo; is Strong&rsquo;s #G5133 and it comes from
the word that is Strong&rsquo;s #G5132, which is actually a word for &ldquo;table.&rdquo;  It is
a compound word made up of the word for &ldquo;four&rdquo; and the word for &ldquo;foot,&rdquo; and it
is speaking of a &ldquo;table.&rdquo;  The Greek word that is Strong&rsquo;s #5133 that is
translated &ldquo;exchangers&rdquo; simply refers to those who sit at a table doing their
business.  </p>

<p>Look at John 2:15 where we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when he&hellip;</p>

<p>This is referring to Christ.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the moneychangers.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the
oxen; and poured out the changers&rsquo; money, and overthrew the <span class="underline">tables</span>;  </p>

<p>These men are sitting at tables in that temple doing their
business.  What they were doing was dishonest; but at the same time, they are
also a picture of those bringing the Gospel, those who buy and sell, and we
will look at this.  But these men were bringing a false gospel.  Here the Lord
is quoting from Jeremiah as well as another verse speaking of how He threw the
moneychangers out of the temple and that they had made it a &ldquo;<b>den of thieves</b>.&rdquo; 
Those men bringing a false gospel in the temple are like dishonest
moneychangers.  </p>

<p>I think that most of us are familiar with the parable of the
ten virgins.  When the Lord came, the five foolish virgins had no oil in their
lamps.  The oil represents the Holy Spirit&mdash;it represents salvation&mdash;and they had
no oil in their lamps.  They then ask the other five to give them some of the
oil from their lamps, as we read in Matthew 25:8-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so; </i>lest there be
not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves.  </p>

<p>Those who were buying and selling in the temple were a
representation of those who bring the Gospel.  Again, these moneychangers whom Christ
threw out were pictures of those bringing a false gospel.  </p>

<p>But here in Mathew 25:27, the Lord is telling this one man
who was given the one talent:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
and <i>then </i>at my coming I should have received mine own with <span class="underline">usury</span>. 
</p>

<p>In other words, they could have given this money to &ldquo;<b>the
exchangers</b>,&rdquo; those who are buying and selling, those who are bringing the
Gospel, in order that he could have received his own &ldquo;<b>with usury</b>.&rdquo;  This
word &ldquo;usury&rdquo; speaks of &ldquo;interest.&rdquo;  It is Strong&rsquo;s #G5110, but it comes from
the base word that is Strong&rsquo;s #G5088 and it means &ldquo;to produce&rdquo; or &ldquo;to bring
forth.&rdquo;  Again, this is speaking of bringing forth, of producing, of bringing
fruit.    </p>

<p>Look at Matthew 1:21 to see one place where this word is
used.  This is also a verse that you should be familiar with.  Matthew 1:21 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And she shall <span class="underline">bring forth</span> a son, and thou shalt call his
name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.  </p>

<p>The Lord Jesus was to be brought forth from this human
woman.  She was to bear this fruit.  This word that is translated &ldquo;bring forth&rdquo;
is the base of the word for &ldquo;usury.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Again, what we are to see here as the Lord tells this &ldquo;<b>wicked
and slothful servant</b>&rdquo; in Matthew 25:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers&hellip; 
</p>

<p>To those who buy and sell, those who sit at the table:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and <i>then </i>at my coming I should have received mine own
with usury.  </p>

<p>Or with some fruit, with something brought forth, with some
increase.  </p>

<p>Since we are almost out of time, let us just turn to Luke
19.  This parable starts in verse 11.  This is a different parable because the
parable in Matthew is given after the Lord&rsquo;s triumphal entry after He went out
of the temple to the mount of Olives.  I believe that it is pretty evident that
this parable in Luke 19 was given before He entered Jerusalem.  He was coming
from Jericho to Jerusalem.  Luke 19:11-12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God
should immediately appear. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a
far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.  </p>

<p>Again, this is the same principle.  God visited His people
and trusted them with the Gospel and then went back to Heaven to wait until
that Kingdom was built.  </p>

<p>Then Luke 19:13 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten <span class="underline">pounds</span>&hellip; 
</p>

<p>For ten men, this nobleman delivered unto them one pound
each, and yet he only speaks of three.  This word for &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; is the Greek
word <i>mna</i>, which means &ldquo;silver.&rdquo;  Again, this is the same principle.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 19:16-17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
pounds. And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant&hellip;  </p>

<p>Then we read in Luke 19:18-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
pounds. And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. And another
came, saying, Lord, behold, <i>here is </i>thy pound, which I have kept laid up
in a napkin:  </p>

<p>He has laid it up in &ldquo;<b>a napkin</b>.&rdquo;  There is a
spiritual principle here that we do not have time to get into now.  But he says
basically the same thing, as we read in Luke 19:21-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest
up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. And he
saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, <i>thou </i>wicked
servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not
down, and reaping that I did not sow: Wherefore then gavest not thou my money
into the <span class="underline">bank</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;table&rdquo; from the other
parable.  Again, this is the same principle.  Those who sit at the table doing
business, those who buy and sell, are a figure of those who are bringing the
Gospel.  </p>

<p>This is a very convicting parable.  It causes us to examine
ourselves and to look at ourselves to see if we are truly serving God and
taking what He has given us and using it to bring forth fruit.  </p>

<p>Let me just leave you with one verse in Amos 6:1.  The Lord
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe to them <i>that are </i>at ease in Zion, and trust in the
mountain of Samaria, <i>which are </i>named chief of the nations, to whom the
house of Israel came!  </p>

<p>Those who &ldquo;<b>are at ease in </b><b>Zion</b>&rdquo; are those who
are in the church who really have no interest in bringing the Gospel or no
interest in the command to go and make disciples, to go and bring forth fruit. 
</p>

<p>As I look at the people in the fellowship, I do not see
this.  I see people working in all different ways, people who are certainly
working for the Lord and the Lord is working in them &ldquo;<b>both to will and to do
of <i>his </i>good pleasure</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Again, I believe that this now is what we are to see in this
&ldquo;<b>wicked and slothful servant</b>&rdquo; who was given a talent and did nothing with
it.  </p>

<p>Shall we pray.  Heavenly Father, again we come before You
and just say could it be that we have brought forth the truth in what we have
looked at today, that we have glorified You and You alone in salvation, that
You are sovereign in salvation in that You have chosen Your people from before
the foundations of the world and made atonement for them from before the
foundations of the world.  Could we examine ourselves as the Day of Judgment
draws nigh and make sure that we are carrying out the commission that You have
given us to go into all the world with the Gospel.  Father, we thank You for
the way that You have blessed us in this life.  We are all secure and
comfortable, but could it be that each one of us would have a heart to take
what You have given us to simply serve You and to make disciples.  Father,
while it still is in Your mercy, while it still is the day of salvation, we ask
that You still would have mercy on those around us, our loved ones, our family
and others who still have no fear of You.  We ask that at least we simply might
be used to continue to take this Gospel into the world knowing that You will
work through it and save whom You will save.  Again, may it all be to Your
glory.  In Jesus&rsquo; Name we pray.  Amen.  </p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Does anybody have any questions or
comments?    </p>

<p><b><i>1<sup>st</sup> Question:</i>  </b>Regarding burying
the talent in the earth, is that a picture perhaps of the wicked servant burying
the talent in the world?    </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Yes, probably.  It was hid in this
cursed earth.  So, yes.  But it is focusing more on the word &ldquo;hid,&rdquo; I think,
that he just hid it from man.  That this earth is cursed might also be in view
there.  </p>

<p>In the other parable, the man hid it by laying it up in a
napkin, and I think that there is a spiritual principle there.  That word &ldquo;napkin&rdquo;
is only used in two other places.  One place that it is used is when Christ&rsquo;s
face &ldquo;<b>was bound about with a napkin</b>&rdquo; when He was in the tomb.  </p>

<p>The Bible speaks a lot about the blessing of God making His
face to shine upon us, which was in the benediction from the book of Numbers
that was used for all of those years by the church, &ldquo;<b>The LORD make his face
shine upon thee</b>.&rdquo;  A lot of the Psalms speak of &ldquo;<b><i>why </i>hidest thou
thy face from me</b>?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>When &ldquo;<b>the light of thy countenance</b>&rdquo; comes upon us,
this is the blessing of the Lord in salvation.  When He was dead in that tomb,
it was as if the Lord was dead and there was no salvation.  So it would
probably be the same principle as hiding it in the earth, in the cursed earth. 
</p>

<p><b><i>2<sup>nd</sup> Question:  </i></b>Would the man who
hid the one talent be like the watchman who sees the sword coming but does not
sound the alarm?  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Certainly, certainly.  That is the same
thing.  Yes.    </p>

<p><b><i>3<sup>rd</sup> Question:  </i></b>How do people get
these talents?  Does God give them to them?  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>It is just representative of money.  It
is just a picture of the Gospel, of God&rsquo;s goods, of His riches.  He has
entrusted the Gospel to mankind, a certain amount to someone and a certain
amount to another, &ldquo;<b>to every man according to his several [<i>separate</i>]
ability</b>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>You are entrusted with the Gospel.  When you are handing
those tracts out, you are giving that Gospel out to the world.  </p>

<p><b><i>4<sup>th</sup> Question:</i>  </b>Do people earn these
talents?    </p>

<p><b><i><span lang=ES>Guy:  </span></i></b><span lang=ES>No,
no, no, no.  </span>No, this is entirely by the grace of God.  In His sovereign
grace, He gives to one five talents, He gave to another two, simply because He is
God.    </p>

<p><b><i>5<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>The man who hid that
talent, was he trusting in his own works?  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>No, he was not trusting in his works. 
He simply had no understanding of what he was supposed to do.  He was not a
saved man.  He was not working with the Gospel and getting it out into the
world.  He feared.  He had fear, but he was not used of the Lord to bring forth
any fruit.  </p>

<p><b><i>6<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>As a result of
hearing the Gospel, should a person who calls himself a child of God not be one
of those people who are out there bringing the Gospel?  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Are you saying that this man with the
one talent who did not do anything with it is someone who heard the Gospel?  </p>

<p><b><i>6<sup>th</sup> Question (continued):  </i></b>Yes.  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Those who are in the corporate church
are among the many of the unsaved who have heard a lot of the Gospel.  They
know a lot about God but they are not saved.  It is like what we read in Matthew
7; when the Lord comes in judgment they say, &ldquo;<b>Lord, Lord, have we not&hellip;in thy
name done many wonderful works</b>?&rdquo;  These are people who have heard the
Gospel.  Many of them are well-versed in the Bible.  They know about judgment
and they know about the grace of God, but it is not unto salvation.  </p>

<p>I want to show you a verse in Hosea.  In the whole book of
Hosea, the Lord is speaking to Israel and telling them that He is going to
bring judgment on them because they have had the Word.  Again, they are a
representation of His people.  In Hosea 8:1-2, we read:    </p>

<p class="verse"><i>Set </i>the trumpet to thy mouth. <i>He shall come </i>as an
eagle against the house of JEHOVAH&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking about bringing judgment against the
Israelites, against those people who should be His representatives on this
earth.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;<i>He shall come </i>as an eagle against the house of JEHOVAH,
because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. Israel
shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.  </p>

<p>You see, a lot of those in the churches know a lot about the
Lord and about the Gospel.  But what this particularly meant was that it was
not unto salvation.  </p>

<p><b><i>7<sup>th</sup> Question:  </i></b>When we are not
sharing the Gospel, is that not the same as murdering that person?  Are we not
robbing them from hearing the true Gospel?  </p>

<p><b><i>Guy:  </i></b>Sure.  Also, if you bring a false gospel,
that is the same as killing them because the Gospel brings life.  </p>
