<p>Please turn to Psalm 85.  We will just read through Psalm 85
verse-by-verse and see what we can see of God&rsquo;s plan for this creation in this
Psalm.  Bible study is a form of worship.  Whenever we are reading the Bible,
pondering and meditating and trying to understand, it is a form of worship.  So
let me just read through this Psalm.  </p>

<p>Psalm 85:1-13 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. JEHOVAH,
thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity
of Jacob. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all
their sin. Selah. Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned <i>thyself
</i>from the fierceness of thine anger. Turn us, O God of our salvation, and
cause thine anger toward us to cease. Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt
thou draw out thine anger to all generations? Wilt thou not revive us again:
that thy people may rejoice in thee? Show us thy mercy, O JEHOVAH, and grant us
thy salvation. I will hear what God JEHOVAH will speak: for he will speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. Surely
his salvation <i>is </i>nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our
land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed <i>each
other.</i> Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look
down from heaven. Yea, JEHOVAH shall give <i>that which is </i>good; and our
land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set
<i>us </i>in the way of his steps.  </p>

<p>This Psalm starts out with the writer being inspired by God
to say in verse 1, Psalm 85:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
brought back the captivity of Jacob.  </p>

<p>It is so important to understand what the land represents in
the Bible.  In the seminaries today and in most of the churches, they do not
understand how God uses the land.  God used the physical land of Israel over
there, the land of Canaan in the Middle East, to be a representation of the Kingdom
 of God, and yet in the churches and in the seminaries today, they are still
all hung up on this physical land.  They are saying that God still has some
plan for this physical land.  </p>

<p>As we see these errors, we cannot look down on others with
disdain or contempt.  We can only glory and thank God that He has shown us
these things.  We must simply try to teach them to others.  </p>

<p>But the land of Israel&mdash;that physical land that was given to
Abraham and then divided up by lot to the Israelites when they came out of
Egypt&mdash;is a picture of the Kingdom of God.  You should be able to see this
spiritually all through the Bible, but let us just look at a couple of verses
in Psalm 37, verses that actually tell us this.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 37:3, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Trust in JEHOVAH, and do good; <i>so </i>shalt thou dwell in the
land, and verily thou shalt be fed [<i>or shepherded</i>].  </p>

<p>Look at verse 9 of this same Psalm, Psalm 37:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon
JEHOVAH, they shall inherit the earth.  </p>

<p>Now He is talking about inheriting the earth rather than the
land.  He is starting to relate the physical land of Canaan to inheriting the
earth: &ldquo;the meek shall inherit the earth.&rdquo;  We know it is not this cursed
earth.  It will be the new Heavens and the new earth.  </p>

<p>Then verse 10 says, Psalm 37:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">For yet a little while, and the wicked <i>shall </i>not <i>be: </i>yea,
thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <i>shall </i>not <i>be.</i>  </p>

<p>In this verse we also see annihilation, but then verse 11
says, Psalm 37:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace.  </p>

<p>We know that we are at peace with God.  Christ has made
peace for us in His work and the true believers will &ldquo;delight themselves in the
abundance of peace&rdquo; in the new Heavens and the new earth.  </p>

<p>Look also at verse 18 of this same Psalm, Psalm 37:18:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
shall be&hellip;   </p>

<p>It will not be the land or the earth:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;their inheritance shall be for ever.  </p>

<p>Their inheritance shall be eternal life.  Do you see how He
keeps relating it and teaching us through these words?  </p>

<p>Now verse 22, Psalm 37:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>such as be </i>blessed of him shall inherit the earth;
and <i>they that be </i>cursed of him shall be cut off.  </p>

<p>Now verse 27, Psalm 37:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.  </p>

<p>Now verse 29, Psalm 37:29:  </p>

<p class="verse">The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
ever.  </p>

<p>There it is.  </p>

<p>Next, verse 34, Psalm 37:34:    </p>

<p class="verse">Wait on JEHOVAH, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <i>it.</i>  </p>

<p>So this is what the land spiritually represents, as we are
reading here in the first verse of Psalm 85, Psalm 85:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH, thou hast been favourable unto thy land&hellip;  </p>

<p>He has shown favor to His people, actually, who make up this
land, the Kingdom of God.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. </p>

<p>Whenever we see this phrase in the Bible, &ldquo;brought back the
captivity,&rdquo; it is actually speaking of salvation.  </p>

<p>Turn to Psalm 14:7.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Oh that the salvation of Israel <i>were come </i>out of Zion!
when JEHOVAH bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, <i>and

</i>Israel shall be glad.  </p>

<p>David wrote this Psalm under the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit.  However, during the time of David, the Israelites were not in any
physical captivity; and so this has to be spiritual.  </p>

<p>We read in the end of the book of Job, in Job 42:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
friends: also JEHOVAH gave Job twice as much as he had before.  </p>

<p>We know that Job was under the wrath of God in this whole
story.  As Christ was under the wrath of God, this is what we are to see in
Job.  But we read that Jehovah turned Job&rsquo;s captivity in the end.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 85:2, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, He is relating salvation to being favorable and
bringing back the captivity of His people.  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
all their sin. Selah.  </p>

<p>If your sins are covered, they cannot be seen.  Again, the
mercy of God has covered the sins of His people by atoning for them through the
work of the Lord Jesus before the foundations of the world.  </p>

<p>If we turn to Psalm 32:1-2, it opens up with:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>is he whose </i>transgression <i>is </i>forgiven, <i>whose
</i>sin <i>is </i>covered. Blessed <i>is </i>the man unto whom JEHOVAH imputeth
not iniquity, and in whose spirit <i>there is </i>no guile.  </p>

<p>Returning back to Psalm 85:3, He continues on with this same
thought.  He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned <i>thyself </i>from
the fierceness of thine anger.  </p>

<p>There is no more judgment to the people of God.  </p>

<p>But then Psalm 85:4 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
to cease.  </p>

<p>He has already started out in the first three verses of
Psalm 85 speaking of how the Psalmist knows that God&rsquo;s people have been saved
from their sin, and yet now he begins to plead with God to turn His anger away
from Israel.  I believe what we are to see in this is that the Psalmist is
pleading for the corporate body, that God might bless them because they are still
in tribulation.  </p>

<p>From Psalm 73 to around Psalm 88, some of these Psalms are
in the same vein.  There are a couple of different writers in this group.  Some
of them were written by Asaph, some of them were written for the sons of Korah,
but several of them are in the same vein.  They are speaking of how Israel
still seems to be under the wrath of God, though they know that they are
saved.  </p>

<p>Turn back to Psalm 74.  This is a Maschil of Asaph and he
begins in Psalm 74:1-3 by saying:  </p>

<p class="verse">O God, why hast thou cast <i>us </i>off for ever? <i>why </i>doth
thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? Remember thy congregation, <i>which
</i>thou hast purchased of old&hellip;  </p>

<p>Notice that this says &ldquo;purchased of old,&rdquo; which is referring
to before the foundations of the world.  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember thy congregation, <i>which </i>thou hast purchased of
old; the rod of thine inheritance, <i>which </i>thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
wherein thou hast dwelt. Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <i>even
</i>all <i>that </i>the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the time of tribulation.  </p>

<p>Look at verse 4, Psalm 74:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
up their ensigns <i>for </i>signs.  </p>

<p>Our ensign is the Lord Jesus; but they set up their ensigns
for signs, which is spiritually speaking of false gospels.  </p>

<p>I am not sure and I do not think that anyone is sure of what
He is referring to here, whether this is after the temple was destroyed in 587
B.C. when the Israelites were taken into captivity or if this is simply
referring to a time when they were in tribulation.  The Egyptians, the
Assyrians, the Babylonians all came into Jerusalem at one time or another and
did wreak havoc in there.  But this is a very telling verse here in Psalm
74:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
up their ensigns <i>for </i>signs.  </p>

<p>This applies to what is going on today and how the enemy has
come into the congregations with signs.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 77.  We read in Psalm 77:4-9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
speak. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. I call to
remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit
made diligent search. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be
favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <i>his </i>promise
fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
his tender mercies? Selah.  </p>

<p>Again, this seems to be speaking of a time when God has
forsaken the whole land, His corporate people of Israel.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 79.  Actually, this whole Psalm reads like
this.  Again, this is speaking in verse 1 about the heathen coming into the
inheritance.  We read in Psalm 79:1-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. The dead bodies of
thy servants have they given <i>to be </i>meat unto the fowls of the heaven,
the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they
shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <i>there was </i>none to bury <i>them.</i>
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that
are round about us.  </p>

<p>The whole Psalm goes on in this vein, and Psalm 80 reads
this same way.  We read in Psalm 80:4-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">O JEHOVAH God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy people? Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest
them tears to drink in great measure. Thou makest us a strife unto our
neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. Turn us again, O God of
hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.  </p>

<p>We read this also in Psalm 85:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
to cease.   </p>

<p>Also in the last verse of Psalm 80, Psalm 80:19, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Turn us again, O JEHOVAH God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
and we shall be saved.  </p>

<p>This is the way in which salvation works.  It must be God
who turns us.  We are commanded all through the Bible to turn to Him and to
seek His righteousness, and yet we cannot do this of ourselves.  The Bible
teaches this also.  </p>

<p>This principle is made clear in Jeremiah 31.  Here, He is speaking
of Ephraim particularly; but the whole book of Jeremiah is speaking of the
falling away of the Israelites.  They turned to idols, they perverted the Word
of God, and they cast His Law behind their backs, as it were.  But in Jeremiah
31:18-19, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself <i>thus; </i>Thou
hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed <i>to the
yoke</i>&hellip;   </p>

<p>This is speaking of bringing Ephraim back now and chastising
him.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock
unaccustomed <i>to the yoke: </i>turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou <i>art

</i>JEHOVAH my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that
I was instructed, I smote upon <i>my </i>thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even
confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.  </p>

<p>This is the way in which salvation works.  It is God who
opens our eyes and turns us, and then we will begin to seek Him.  </p>

<p>Returning to Psalm 85, it goes on in Psalm 85:5-6 to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
anger to all generations? Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may
rejoice in thee?  </p>

<p>This is also speaking of the affliction that most true
believers do suffer.  Christ told the apostles in John 16, &ldquo;In the world ye
shall have tribulation.&rdquo;  The 40-year sojourn of the Israelites in the
wilderness was a picture of the sojourn of a believer in this life, as we do
suffer tribulation.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 30.  I think that we see this same principle
in Psalm 30.  This is a beautiful Psalm.  It starts out praising and thanking
God for His salvation.  Psalm 30:1-5 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will extol thee, O JEHOVAH; for thou hast lifted me up, and
hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. O JEHOVAH my God, I cried unto thee,
and thou hast healed me.  </p>

<p>This is salvation language.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">O JEHOVAH, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou
hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing unto JEHOVAH, O
ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. For his
anger <i>endureth but </i>a moment; in his favour <i>is </i>life: weeping may
endure for a night, but joy <i>cometh </i>in the morning.  </p>

<p>This is a Biblical principle.  We are still going to suffer
tribulation.  It is <span class="underline">as if</span> He is still angry with His people as they
suffer affliction.  </p>

<p>It says again at the end of Psalm 30:5:      </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;weeping may endure for a night, but joy <i>cometh </i>in the
morning.  </p>

<p>The morning is associated with the renewing, with the
completion of our salvation, with Judgment Day also.  </p>

<p>Back to Psalm 85:6, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
thee?  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;revive&rdquo; means &ldquo;to give life.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We read next in Psalm 85:7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Show us thy mercy, O JEHOVAH, and grant us thy salvation.  </p>

<p>This can also be looking at the completion of our
salvation.  We know that our salvation is not complete.  There is usually a
point in time for most true believers when they understand that God has saved
them, and yet our salvation is not complete and will not be complete until the
consummation when the true believers will be taken up, which is when they will
receive their resurrected glorified spiritual bodies.  It is then that our
salvation will be complete.  </p>

<p>Let us read Romans 13:11 before going to the next verse in
Psalm 85.  Romans 13:11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And that, knowing the time, that now <i>it is </i>high time to
awake out of sleep&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of our day, especially since we know the
times and we can apply this knowledge to what is going on.  It says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And that, knowing the time, that now <i>it is </i>high time to
awake out of sleep: for now <i>is </i>our salvation nearer than when we
believed.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what this is saying.  The completion of our
salvation is nearer now than at the point when we first believed.  </p>

<p>Next, Psalm 85:8 says:   </p>

<p class="verse">I will hear what God JEHOVAH will speak: for he will speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.  </p>

<p>I believe that this is an admonition not to return by the
way that you came, not to go back into your sin.  This could also be speaking
corporately of Israel, of God&rsquo;s people.  We have come to a time now when God
has given up the corporate church because of their folly.  </p>

<p>Look at Ecclesiastes 10:1.  We looked at this last month [<a
href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/sunday_bible_study/2010.04.04_Berry.htm">Ointment
of the Apothecary</a>].  This is actually speaking of the folly of those who
claim to be God&rsquo;s people.  Ecclesiastes 10:1 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
stinking savour: <i>so doth </i>a little folly him that is in reputation for
wisdom <i>and </i>honour.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;folly&rdquo; means &ldquo;foolishness&rdquo; and it applies to
sinners.  All through the book of Proverbs especially, it speaks of &ldquo;the fool&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the foolish,&rdquo; which is speaking of the unsaved.  But here we are looking at
those who are &ldquo;in reputation for wisdom <i>and </i>honour,&rdquo; which are those who
call themselves Christians or the Jews from the Old Testament.  </p>

<p>This is referring to those who associate themselves with God
and say that they are the people of Jehovah God.  These people are &ldquo;in
reputation&rdquo; or associated with &ldquo;wisdom <i>and </i>honour,&rdquo; the wisdom and honor
of God.  They have, as it were, that holy anointing oil on them, which is a
picture of salvation.  It is a picture of the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p>The apothecary was a Levite whose job it was to make this
ointment.  No one else was allowed to make this and the Israelites were not
allowed to use this personally.  It was a picture of God&rsquo;s salvation and how He
is jealous of His salvation.  This oil has now become rancid and has begun to
stink when it should have been giving forth a beautiful odor.  You can read
about the spices that are in this ointment back in Exodus 30.  But now this is
beginning to stink because of the foolishness that is among those who are
supposed to be God&rsquo;s people.  </p>

<p>This is what is being spoken of here in Psalm 85:8:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will hear what God JEHOVAH will speak: for he will speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.  </p>

<p>This &ldquo;folly&rdquo; is the foolishness of the teachings, the false
gospels, all of the things that we can see among the corporate church today
that do not line up with the Bible.  This is referring to the salvation plan
that they are bringing, as well as the other things that they believe are to be
seen in a believer: signs and wonders, the evidence of speaking in tongues, the
evidence of having the Holy Spirit, and all of the other foolishness that is
seen in the church today.  We are admonished here not to turn to these things
because we are saved, because we are the people of God.  </p>

<p>Then Psalm 85:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Surely his salvation <i>is </i>nigh them that fear him; that
glory may dwell in our land.  </p>

<p>This is again a reference to the land.  The glory is the
glory and honor of God the Father.  </p>

<p>Then in Psalm 85:10, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed <i>each other.</i>  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy&rdquo; is translated in other parts of the Bible as &ldquo;lovingkindness.&rdquo; 
This is speaking of the salvation of God, of His mercy in salvation.  This is
speaking of &ldquo;mercy and truth&rdquo; and we know that God is truth; His Word is
truth.  </p>

<p>Look now at Psalm 119:160.  These four words in Psalm 85:10 are
all attributes of the Lord Jesus in the first place: mercy, truth,
righteousness, and peace.  Psalm 119:160 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy word <i>is </i>true&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word as the word &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">Thy word <i>is </i>true <i>from </i>the beginning: and every one
of thy righteous judgments <i>endureth </i>for ever.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the importance of the Word of God.  </p>

<p>We read again in Psalm 85:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Mercy&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking of the lovingkindness of God.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is speaking about the truth of His Word.  Thy Word is
truth.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;righteousness and peace have kissed <i>each other.</i>  </p>

<p>When we read about a kiss in the Bible, it is not so much a
display of affection as it is a symbol of coming into union.  </p>

<p>We can see how He repeats these two phrases in Psalm 85:10: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed <i>each other.</i></p>

<p>God teaches us in this way in the Bible.  Often in the
Proverbs and in the Psalms, as well as in other places in the Bible, He will
repeat a phrase but use different words.  It is so if we cannot understand the
one, the other one helps us.  </p>

<p>He says again in Psalm 85:10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Mercy and truth are met together&hellip;</p>

<p>And then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;righteousness and peace have kissed <i>each other.  </i></p>

<p>A kiss really suggests a union.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 2.  We know that at the end of a wedding
ceremony, the couple will kiss; but this is looking more at a union than at a
display of love or affection.  Psalm 2:11-12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Serve JEHOVAH with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the
Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <i>from </i>the way&hellip;   </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Son,&rdquo; of course, is the Lord Jesus.  &ldquo;Kiss the Son&rdquo;;
make your peace with God.  Seek His salvation.  Try to be in union with Him.  </p>

<p class="verse">Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish <i>from </i>the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed <i>are </i>all they that
put their trust in him.  </p>

<p>So again, Psalm 85:10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed <i>each other.</i>  </p>

<p>This is referring to the righteousness of Christ and the
peace that God&rsquo;s people have with Him in salvation.  Before salvation, we were
the enemies of God; but Christ made this peace.  Anyone who is saved has been
at peace with God since before the foundations of the world when that atonement
was made.  </p>

<p>Then in Psalm 85:11, it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Truth shall spring out of the earth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, this is referring to the truth of God&rsquo;s Word.  </p>

<p class="verse">Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
look down from heaven.  </p>

<p>In a sense, truth sprang out of the earth when the Lord
Jesus came; but He is also speaking of the truth of His Word.  </p>

<p>He says again in Psalm 85:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
look down from heaven.  </p>

<p>And the Lord is our righteousness.  </p>

<p>Then it goes on to say in Psalm 85:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, JEHOVAH shall give <i>that which is </i>good; and our land
shall yield her increase.  </p>

<p>The increase that the land should be yielding is the fruits
that come forth from a true believer as he serves God and others are brought
into the Kingdom.  We read about all of these fruits that we should see in a
believer in Galatians 6.  </p>

<p>So again, Psalm 85:12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and our land shall yield [<i>or give</i>] her increase.  </p>

<p>Look at Habakkuk 3.  Habakkuk is a frightening book.  It is
speaking of the end.  In Habakkuk 3:17, this is speaking of the end and it is
also speaking of how the church, the corporate body, is dead.  It was looking
at the Israelites back then, too.  </p>

<p>This is why the Bible is a living Book.  It applied to the
Israelites back then and we can see that it applies to the corporate church of
our day, but this is only one reason why the Bible is a living Book.  In Hebrews
4:12, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">For the word of God <i>is </i>quick [<i>living</i>], and
powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword&hellip;  </p>

<p>It is living.  It is the living Word of God.  Christ is the
Word of God and the Word brings life, and yet I cannot adequately explain how
the Bible is a living Book.  </p>

<p>Before we read the verse in Habakkuk, let us first read
Psalm 119:50.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">This <i>is </i>my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
quickened me.  </p>

<p>We must hear the Word.  This is part of our salvation, as it
says:</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for thy word hath quickened me.  </p>

<p>We can also see this in other verses in Psalm 119.  Psalm
119:93 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
quickened me.  </p>

<p>But Habakkuk 3:17-18 is looking at the end, and it says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall </i>fruit

<i>be </i>in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i>there
shall be </i>no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in JEHOVAH, I will joy
in the God of my salvation.  </p>

<p>I believe that it is the word &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; in verse 17 that I am
looking at.  </p>

<p>Habakkuk 3:17 again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall </i><span class="underline">fruit</span>

<i>be </i>in the vines&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; is the same word that was translated &ldquo;increase&rdquo;
in Psalm 85:12.  There is no fruit in His corporate body.  There was not then
and there is not now; but yet, among God&rsquo;s people, truth has sprung out of the
earth and righteousness looks down from Heaven.  As it says in Psalm 85:12:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and our land shall yield her <span class="underline">increase</span>.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people will still continue to bring an increase as He
works in them until the end.  </p>

<p>Then we read in the final verse of Psalm 85, Psalm 85:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set <i>us </i>in
the way of his steps.  </p>

<p>I am not sure how this verse is to be translated.  The
Interlinear translated it one way.  The King James translates it another way.  </p>

<p class="verse">Righteousness shall go before him&hellip;</p>

<p>This is speaking of God in judgment when He comes.  This could
also be speaking of the righteousness of the Lord Jesus and how He comes, as we
read in Malachi.  &ldquo;Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD,&rdquo;
He comes.  He brings the Word which judges.  </p>

<p>Malachi is the last book of the Old Testament.  In Malachi
4:5, He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of JEHOVAH:  </p>

<p>We can also look at Malachi 3:1, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
before me&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is literally speaking of John the Baptist, but this is
also speaking of how God brings the Word.  The Lord Jesus comes as the Word
personified before this judgment.  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even
the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith
JEHOVAH of hosts.  </p>

<p>I believe that this is the principle here in Psalm 85:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set <i>us </i>in
the way of his steps.  </p>

<p>There is another translation in Jay P. Green&rsquo;s Interlinear Bible,
which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Righteousness shall go before Him and shall make a way for His
footsteps. </p>

<p>Either way, we can see the principle in this:  </p>

<p class="verse">Righteousness&hellip;shall make a way for His footsteps.</p>

<p>I believe that this is referring to God in judgment.  </p>

<p>But again, we get our life from this Word.  We must hear
this.  It is part of our salvation.  </p>

<p>One more verse that we could read to close which speaks to how
the Bible is a living Book&mdash;this Word is living&mdash;is John 6:63.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">It is the spirit that quickeneth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or brings life.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the flesh profiteth nothing&hellip;  </p>

<p>Our works or the flesh can do nothing in salvation.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the words that I speak unto you&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the Bible.  Christ is the Word
personified and made manifest.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the words that I speak unto you, <i>they </i>are spirit, and <i>they
</i>are life.  </p>

<p>To God be the glory.  We will close here.  </p>
