<p>I would like to go over a study that was actually done by
Anthony Hernandez a month or two back comparing Judas with Satan and the unsaved
in the end-time corporate church.  I would also like to look at Psalm 55 to
incorporate that study into a few verses of Psalm 55.  Let us just read Psalm
55 so that we will have these verses in mind, especially verses 12 to 15 in
this Psalm.  These are the verses that I would like to particularly look at.  Psalm
55:1-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <i>A Psalm </i>of
David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; Because
of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they
cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. My heart is sore pained
within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. Fearfulness and
trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that
I had wings like a dove! <i>for then </i>would I fly away, and be at rest. Lo, <i>then
</i>would I wander far off, <i>and </i>remain in the wilderness. Selah. I would
hasten my escape from the windy storm <i>and </i>tempest. Destroy, O Lord, <i>and
</i>divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. Day
and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <i>are
</i>in the midst of it. Wickedness <i>is </i>in the midst thereof: deceit and
guile depart not from her streets. For <i>it was </i>not an enemy <i>that </i>reproached
me; then I could have borne <i>it: </i>neither <i>was it </i>he that hated me <i>that
</i>did magnify <i>himself </i>against me; then I would have hid myself from
him: But <i>it was </i>thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
We took sweet counsel together, <i>and </i>walked unto the house of God in
company. Let death seize upon them, <i>and </i>let them go down quick into
hell: for wickedness <i>is </i>in their dwellings, <i>and </i>among them. As
for me, I will call upon God; and JEHOVAH shall save me. Evening, and morning,
and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. He hath
delivered my soul in peace from the battle <i>that was </i>against me: for
there were many with me. God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth
of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. He
hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken
his covenant.<i> The words </i>of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <i>was
</i>in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <i>were </i>they drawn
swords. Cast thy burden upon JEHOVAH, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never
suffer the righteous to be moved. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into
the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days; but I will trust in thee.  </p>

<p>This Psalm was written by David under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit.  We are to see Christ in the words that David speaks.  We are to
particularly see the rebellion against David that comes from within, from his
own people.  </p>

<p>We see here in Psalm 55:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Destroy, O Lord, <i>and </i>divide their tongues: for I have
seen violence and strife in the city.  </p>

<p>When we read about a city in the Bible, this often represents
a body of believers.  </p>

<p>In Matthew 5:14, Christ says to His disciples:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid.  </p>

<p>We read a lot in Isaiah about &ldquo;the city&rdquo; and how God would
use Cyrus, that heathen king, to build His city.  In this, Cyrus was a figure
of Christ in that he was used to destroy the Babylonians.  Cyrus was a king of
the Medes and Persians.  </p>

<p>Here in Psalm 55:9, David is speaking about:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;violence and strife in the city.  </p>

<p>When we read about violence in the Bible, this is actually
speaking about the violence that the people who are supposed to be God&rsquo;s own
people have done to His Law.  </p>

<p>The entire book of Zephaniah is speaking about the judgment
that is coming, but it also speaks about how it is going to come on Judah and Jerusalem,
God&rsquo;s own people.  In Zephaniah 3:1-4, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city! She
obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in JEHOVAH;
she drew not near to her God. Her princes within her <i>are </i>roaring lions;
her judges <i>are </i>evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. Her
prophets <i>are </i>light <i>and </i>treacherous persons: her priests have
polluted the sanctuary, they have done <span class="underline">violence</span> to the law.  </p>

<p>This is the violence that David was speaking of in Psalm
55:9:  </p>

<p class="verse">Destroy, O Lord, <i>and </i>divide their tongues: for I have
seen <span class="underline">violence</span> and strife [or <i>contention</i>] in the city.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of rebellion against the Word of God among
His people.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 55:10, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
also and sorrow <i>are </i>in the midst of it.  </p>

<p>This mischief and sorrow is again speaking of rebellion
against God coming from those who should be His people.  </p>

<p>He goes on to say in Psalm 55:11:  </p>

<p class="verse">Wickedness <i>is </i>in the midst thereof: deceit and guile
depart not from her streets.  </p>

<p>He is again speaking of His own people.  We will see that
this language prefigures the New Testament church, but here He is speaking of
the Israelites.  </p>

<p>And in Psalm 55:12-13, we read where David says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>it was </i>not an enemy <i>that </i>reproached me; then I
could have borne <i>it: </i>neither <i>was it </i>he that hated me <i>that </i>did
magnify <i>himself </i>against me; then I would have hid myself from him: But <i>it
was </i>thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.  </p>

<p>I have looked at this Psalm in the past and always tried to
understand who this was.  It seems obvious that this is speaking of Judas,
because he was among those disciples, those twelve disciples who were a
representation of God&rsquo;s church.  It occurred to me that maybe this was speaking
about the true believers because they are the ones who really crucified Christ. 
</p>

<p>I also thought that maybe this could be speaking of God the
Father:  </p>

<p class="verse">For <i>it was </i>not an enemy <i>that </i>reproached me&hellip;<i>it
was </i>thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.  </p>

<p>It was actually God the Father who purposed to crucify Christ,
but I believe from the context of this whole Psalm that this has to be talking
about Judas and it has to be speaking about the rebellion against Christ and
against His truth from those who are supposed to be His people.  </p>

<p>It says again in Psalm 55:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">But <i>it was </i>thou, a man mine equal&hellip;  </p>

<p>In the literal translation, which you might have a note from
in your Bible, it actually says, &ldquo;a man according to my rank.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then He goes on to say:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;my <span class="underline">guide</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;guide&rdquo; is also used in Zechariah 12:5-6, which
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the <span class="underline">governors</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>That is the same word that was translated as &ldquo;guide.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>shall be </i>my strength in JEHOVAH of hosts their
God. In that day will I make the governors&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, He repeats this word.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood,
and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round
about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited
again in her own place, <i>even </i>in Jerusalem.  </p>

<p>I believe that &ldquo;the governors of Judah&rdquo; here is speaking of
the elect and how in the final judgment they will inherit Jerusalem forever.  A
governor is a leader, like a prince in Israel.  </p>

<p>But He says here in Psalm 55:13-14 where He has to be
speaking of Judas:  </p>

<p class="verse">But <i>it was </i>thou, a man mine equal&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or &ldquo;a man according to my rank.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;my guide&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or &ldquo;one of My governors, teachers, prophets, or priests in Israel.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and mine acquaintance.  </p>

<p>Or &ldquo;friend.&rdquo;  </p>

<p class="verse">We took sweet counsel together, <i>and </i>walked unto the house
of God in company.  </p>

<p>This is referring to God&rsquo;s people.  Even the hypocrites
among them &ldquo;took sweet counsel together.&rdquo;  This &ldquo;sweet counsel&rdquo; is the Word of
God.  They went to worship every Sabbath in company with Christ, which is
really what this is speaking about.  </p>

<p>Then in Psalm 55:15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let death seize upon them, <i>and </i>let them go down quick
into hell: for wickedness <i>is </i>in their dwellings, <i>and </i>among them. 
</p>

<p>This word &ldquo;quick&rdquo; means &ldquo;alive.&rdquo;  I believe that this is
anticipating that five-month period that is going to begin on May 21, 2011 and
is going to end on October 21, 2011 when judgment will be most severe upon
those who are still alive at the end.  </p>

<p>I believe that the whole point of God&rsquo;s salvation and
judgment plan is that those in the church today are the most wicked in the
history of mankind.  Their rebellion is worse than ever because God is opening
up His Bible.  He is really opening up the truth of how salvation works, that
it is entirely by the faith of Christ, that it is entirely by the work of God. 
He is also opening up His judgment and showing us that He is perfectly righteous
and merciful in His judgment in that unsaved man is simply going to cease to
exist and not be tormented forever in a place called &ldquo;hell.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>But here where it says in Psalm 55:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let death seize upon them, <i>and </i>let them go down [<i>alive</i>]
into hell&hellip;  </p>

<p>I believe that this is particularly speaking of those at the
end who are going to be alive when Christ comes, raptures His people, and then
judges this earth for 153 days.  </p>

<p>Turn to Numbers 16.  This is the account of Dathan, Korah,
and Abiram when they rebelled against Moses in the wilderness.  This is again
the same picture of the people of God, those Israelites whom He brought out of Egypt
and particularly blessed.  He gave to them His laws and showed them all of
those miracles as He drowned the Egyptians in the Red Sea.  He had sustained
them for forty years in the wilderness.  Their shoes did not wear out,
miraculously.  He fed them with &ldquo;manna&hellip;from heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;water out of the rock.&rdquo; 
They saw all of this, and yet they rebelled against Moses.  So in Numbers
16:1-5, we read: </p>

<p class="verse">Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of
Reuben, took <i>men:</i> And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the
children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in
the congregation, men of renown: And they gathered themselves together against
Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <i>Ye take </i>too much upon you,
seeing all the congregation <i>are </i>holy, every one of them, and JEHOVAH <i>is
</i>among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of
JEHOVAH? And when Moses heard <i>it, </i>he fell upon his face: And he spake
unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow JEHOVAH will show
who <i>are </i>his, and <i>who is </i>holy; and will cause <i>him </i>to come
near unto him: even <i>him </i>whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near
unto him.  </p>

<p>Then Moses tells Korah in Numbers 16:6:  </p>

<p class="verse">This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;  </p>

<p>At this point, there was going to be a separation, and we
see this separation again today.  It is the same separation.  The true
believers are separated from those in the corporate churches.  They understand
that they are to get out of it, that God is not using it anymore.  He is not blessing
it.  He has taken His Spirit out of the corporate body and He is not using the
church to save sinners.  Our fellowship is directly with the Lord now.  </p>

<p>Then in Numbers 16:23-33, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the congregation,
saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And
Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel
followed him. And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
from the tents of these wicked men&hellip;  </p>

<p>He is telling them to get away from them, to depart from
them:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their
sins. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every
side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and
their wives, and their sons, and their little children. And Moses said, Hereby
ye shall know that JEHOVAH hath sent me to do all these works; for <i>I have </i>not
<i>done them </i>of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all
men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; <i>then </i>JEHOVAH
hath not sent me. But if JEHOVAH make a new thing, and the earth open her
mouth, and swallow them up, with all that <i>appertain </i>unto them, and they
go down quick [<i>alive</i>] into the pit; then ye shall understand that these
men have provoked JEHOVAH. And it came to pass, as he had made an end of
speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that <i>was </i>under
them: And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,
and all the men that <i>appertained </i>unto Korah, and all <i>their </i>goods.
They, and all that <i>appertained </i>to them, went down <span class="underline">alive</span> into the
pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the
congregation.</p>

<p>So here we read again in Psalm 55:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let death seize upon them, <i>and </i>let them go down <span class="underline">quick</span>
[<i>alive</i>] into hell&hellip;   </p>

<p>Now turn to Revelation 19.  This is also speaking of that
final judgment at the end.  Revelation 19:20 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the
mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.  </p>

<p>This is referring to Satan and all of those who had been
deceived by him, all those who claimed to be the people of God.  It continues: 
</p>

<p class="verse">These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with
brimstone.  </p>

<p>I believe that this is really what we are to see here in
Psalm 55:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let death seize upon them, <i>and </i>let them go down quick
into hell: for wickedness <i>is </i>in their dwellings, <i>and </i>among them. 
</p>

<p>Let us look at Judas a little bit.  Judas was one of the
twelve disciples and looked just like the other eleven.  There was no outward
rebellion that anyone could see.  He had no resistance to what Christ was teaching. 
He seemed to be one of them.  </p>

<p>Turn to John 12.  In John 12:3-6, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house
was filled with the odour of the ointment. Then saith one of his disciples,
Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s <i>son, </i>which should betray him, Why was not this
ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not
that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and
bare what was put therein.  </p>

<p>Is this not amazing how God worked this out?  This one man
who is referred to as &ldquo;the son of perdition&rdquo; is the one man among those
disciples whom God worked out to be the treasurer for the twelve.  He held the money
and he is referred to here as &ldquo;a thief.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us turn to John 10.  I believe that Mr. Camping has been
speaking about what the thief represents in the Bible.  In John 10:1, we read
where Christ is speaking about a shepherd:  </p>

<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
robber.  </p>

<p>Now look at John 10:8-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be
saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for
to steal, and to kill, and to destroy&hellip;  </p>

<p>He destroys life.  This is what a thief does, a false
teacher.  He robs one of life in that he does not bring truth.  </p>

<p>John 10:10 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i>it
</i>more abundantly.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 10.  In Isaiah 10, Isaiah is speaking in this
same vein.  He is speaking of the judgment that is going to be brought on Israel
for their rebellion, for their false teachings and their works gospels.  So
Isaiah 10:1-2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
grievousness <i>which </i>they have prescribed; To turn aside the needy from
judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows
may be their prey, and <i>that </i>they may rob the fatherless!  </p>

<p>Or look at Hosea 6.  The book of Hosea is also speaking
about the rebellion of Israel.  Hosea 6:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i>so </i>the company
of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.  </p>

<p>This is again what we have been speaking of, which is
violence to the Law in that they are bringing false gospels.  They are
murdering.  They are robbing anyone of life who comes to them for truth.  And
we are reading that Judas was a thief, that God called him a thief, and yet he
traveled with the twelve.  He is right in there with them.  </p>

<p>If you turn to Mark 3:14-16, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
he might send them forth to preach,  </p>

<p>This is a picture of the whole church.  </p>

<p class="verse">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:  </p>

<p>This is speaking of salvation.  </p>

<p class="verse">And Simon he surnamed Peter;  </p>

<p>He goes on to name the other disciples.  Then in Mark
3:19-20, He names Judas:  </p>

<p class="verse">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into
an house. And the multitude cometh together again&hellip;  </p>

<p>So Judas went out with the twelve in that commission.  We
read about this in Matthew 10 and how He sent them out.  </p>

<p>Judas was also physically washed by Christ.  In John 13, we
read about when Christ washed their feet.  We read in John 13:2-4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s <i>son, </i>to betray him; Jesus knowing that the
Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and
went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
towel, and girded himself.  </p>

<p>We go on to read that He washed their feet, which was simply
a picture of the washing that we need in salvation.  This was when Peter asked Christ
to wash his whole body, but Christ told him that he only needed to have his
feet washed.  We walk on our feet.  This is again a spiritual picture.  </p>

<p>Then in John 13:10-11, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i>his
</i>feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew
who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.  </p>

<p>And then in John 13:15, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
done to you.  </p>

<p>Christ is our example.  As He washed the disciples&rsquo; feet, we
are to go out into the world with those tracts, or in whatever way we can, and
work to further the Gospel into the world.  We are being used of God really to
wash the feet of His disciples, those who will be saved.  </p>

<p>Judas also ate bread with Christ.  In John 13:23-24, we
read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now there was leaning on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved.  </p>

<p>This would have been John.  </p>

<p class="verse">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake.  </p>

<p>He was telling them that one of them was going to betray
Him.  </p>

<p>Then we read in John 13:26:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
have dipped <i>it. </i>And when he had dipped the sop, he gave <i>it </i>to
Judas Iscariot, <i>the son </i>of Simon.  </p>

<p>He had indicated to them that it was Judas who was going to
betray Him.  </p>

<p>So Judas was right in there with the other disciples eating
with Christ, and to eat is a picture of partaking of the Gospel, partaking of Christ&rsquo;s
body.  </p>

<p>In Psalm 41, we read a similar verse to what we are reading
in Psalm 55.  Psalm 41:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
of my bread, hath lifted up <i>his </i>heel against me.  </p>

<p>There are also verses in the Gospels that tell us how Judas
identifies with Satan.  </p>

<p>In John 6:70, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve&hellip;  </p>

<p>He did this for His purpose.  He purposely chose Judas.  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and one of you is a devil?  </p>

<p>He just flat-out calls him a devil.  We already read at one
point that Satan entered into Judas at the time of the last supper.  As I
mentioned earlier, Christ called him &ldquo;the son of perdition.&rdquo;  And the end-time
church, those who are in the corporate church in the end-time, are actually
identified with Satan.  </p>

<p>In John 8:44, Christ said to those Pharisees:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye are of <i>your </i>father the devil, and the lusts of your
father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again we see this issue of murdering.  Satan was a murderer
because he takes life.  But here, God is speaking to the leaders of the
corporate church of that day.  </p>

<p>We are all familiar with 2 Corinthians where it speaks of
false apostles.  Let us read this.  It says in 2 Corinthians 11:13:    </p>

<p class="verse">For such <i>are </i>false apostles, deceitful workers,
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  </p>

<p>He is again speaking of those who have crept into the church
who are false teachers.  They are unsaved people.  </p>

<p>Then 2 Corinthians 11:14-15 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
light. Therefore <i>it is </i>no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to
their works.  </p>

<p>We are all familiar with the parable of the wheat and the
tares, which is again speaking of how Satan creeps in and sows tares among
those who are in that physical body, that church.  </p>

<p>In some of those verses that we have just read, Judas is
referred to as a traitor or a betrayer.  This same word is found in Acts 7.  In
Acts 7:51-52, we read where Stephen says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <i>did, </i>so <i>do </i>ye. Which of
the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which
showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the
betrayers and murderers:  </p>

<p>Judas is called a traitor or a betrayer and this is that
same word.  Again, this is looking right at the corporate church who are
actually the betrayers and traitors.  </p>

<p>In Mark 14, we read of Judas that it would have been better
had he never have been born.  Mark 14 is speaking of the judgment that is going
to come and how terrible it is going to be for those who are alive when Christ
comes who are in the church but who do not really know the Lord and who resist
the truth of the Gospel when it is brought to them.  </p>

<p>In Mark 14:21, Christ is speaking of Judas:  </p>

<p class="verse">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he
had never been born.</p>

<p>We know that Judas repented after they had taken Christ.  He
understood what he had done, but he is a picture of the corporate church.  If
he had been a picture of an individual, there would have been the possibility
of salvation in his repentance.  However, Judas is a picture of the corporate
church.  There came a point in time in the history of mankind when there was no
more mercy and they would not be able to repent and be saved from their wicked
deeds.  </p>

<p>We will have to stop here, but there are more parallels that
we could look at, parallels between Judas and the unsaved in the church in the
end-times.  As God is really opening up His Word to us, we are seeing these
things and we are learning more and more about His judgment plan and about His
salvation plan.  </p>

<p>Marvelously for man, today is still the day of salvation. 
His mercy is still here.  We can do nothing but go to Him.  There is nowhere
else that we can go.  All we can do is to go to Him with nothing but a plea for
His mercy.  </p>

<p>Shall we pray.  Heavenly Father, we ask that it could be
that our words have glorified You, that we have brought forth truth from the
Scriptures.  If we have erred, we understand that in Your mercy we, in our
imperfections and errors, cannot hurt Your elect.  We cannot impede Your plan
of salvation because You will save those whom You have elected to salvation
from before the foundations of the world.  In this time of thanksgiving, we do
thank You for all of the blessings that You have heaped on us.  Especially in
this country, we are rich and that is only from You.  We cannot take any credit
for our wherewithal.  We simply ask that each one of us might have a heart to
serve You with what You have given to us.  Like those whom You gave the talents
to, may we simply use them to gain, to bring in more.  May it all be to Your
glory.  We pray this in Jesus&rsquo; Name.  Amen.  </p>
