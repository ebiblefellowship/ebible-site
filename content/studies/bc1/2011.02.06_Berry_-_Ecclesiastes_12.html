<p>Turn to Ecclesiastes 12.  Over the past few years, I have
looked at this chapter a couple of times.  I could not get anywhere with a
study that I was trying to work on last night, so I thought that we would look
at this chapter again because this chapter is looking right at what is going to
happen in just over 100 days.  So let us turn to Ecclesiastes 12 and I will
read the chapter.  Maybe we will be able to see some things in here that we
have not seen before.  We read in Ecclesiastes 12:1-14:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them; While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be
not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: In the day when the keepers
of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the
grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be
darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
daughters of music shall be brought low; Also <i>when </i>they shall be afraid
of <i>that which is </i>high, and fears <i>shall be </i>in the way, and the
almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire
shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the
streets: Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or
the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then
shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto
God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all <i>is </i>vanity. And
moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge;
yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, <i>and </i>set in order many proverbs. The
preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and <i>that which was </i>written
<i>was </i>upright, <i>even </i>words of truth. The words of the wise <i>are </i>as
goads, and as nails fastened <i>by </i>the masters of assemblies, <i>which </i>are
given from one shepherd. And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of
making many books <i>there is </i>no end; and much study <i>is </i>a weariness
of the flesh. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
keep his commandments: for this <i>is </i>the whole <i>duty </i>of man. For God
shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether <i>it be
</i>good, or whether <i>it be </i>evil.  </p>

<p>This chapter starts out in Ecclesiastes 12:1 admonishing us: 
</p>

<p class="verse">Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>The youth in the Bible represent the strong men.  This word
particularly applies to the people of God in their prime, those doing the will
of God.  The youth in the Old Testament were the ones who were chosen or who
were elected.  The root word for this has been translated as &ldquo;chosen.&rdquo;  The
youth are the ones who went out and fought the battles, which is a picture of
those who are doing the work of God.  It can also refer to those in the church
who had the blessings of God; but God is admonishing us here:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are to remember our Creator in the days of our youth,
while it is the day of salvation.  </p>

<p>Then He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when
thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>On May 21<sup>st</sup>, these &ldquo;evil days&rdquo; are going to
begin.  God&rsquo;s people are going to be taken out of this world.  There will be no
more Gospel and no more salvation.  What an incomprehensible and horrible thing
to contemplate.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is often used in the Bible to speak of the
judgment of God.  For example, look at Proverbs 16:4.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH hath made all <i>things </i>for himself: yea, even the
wicked for the day of evil.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;day of evil&rdquo; is Judgment Day; but He is telling us now
to remember our Creator, to make ourselves right with God, as if we could do
this, because Judgment Day is coming and salvation is going to end.  </p>

<p>We know how salvation works.  We know that this is entirely
by the choosing of God and that salvation was atoned for before this creation,
and yet all throughout the Bible God commands us to seek Him and to seek His
salvation.  We will be without excuse if we are not in Christ when this day
comes.  </p>

<p>So, again, He says in Ecclesiastes 12:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no
pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>This is referring to the 153 days from May 21<sup>st</sup>
to October 21<sup>st</sup> when salvation has been cut off.  He refers to this
as &ldquo;years&rdquo; here, but I do not have any trouble with this.  </p>

<p>Turn to Joel 2.  Joel 2:1-2 starts out:  </p>

<p class="verse">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of JEHOVAH
cometh, for <i>it is </i>nigh at hand; A day of darkness and of gloominess, a
day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains:
a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall
be any more after it, <i>even </i>to the years of many generations.  </p>

<p>He is referring to eternity here, and yet He is speaking of
it as if it is measured in time.  God speaks this way in the Bible.  </p>

<p>Another passage is in Isaiah 65 where He is speaking of the
new heavens and the new earth.  We read in Isaiah 65:17-20:  </p>

<p class="verse">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice
for ever <i>in that </i>which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my
people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
of crying. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that
hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the
sinner <i>being </i>an hundred years old shall be accursed.  </p>

<p>He is speaking in terms of years, and yet He is referring to
eternity where time is not measured.  </p>

<p>I believe this is why we find the word &ldquo;years&rdquo; in
Ecclesiastes 12:1.  God is telling us to make our calling and election sure before: 
 </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>The pleasure of a child of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and
the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 1.  Psalm 1:1-2 starts out:    </p>

<p class="verse">Blessed <i>is </i>the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful. But his <span class="underline">delight</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>This is the same word as &ldquo;pleasure.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So we are to make our peace with God before those days come
when it will be said, as we read in Ecclesiastes 12:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;I have no <span class="underline">pleasure</span> in them;  </p>

<p>This is because there will be no salvation; there will be no
Christ.  </p>

<p>Psalm 1:2 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">But his delight [<i>or pleasure</i>] <i>is </i>in the law of
JEHOVAH; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 111.  Psalm 111:1-2 starts out:  </p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye JEHOVAH. I will praise JEHOVAH with <i>my </i>whole
heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <i>in </i>the congregation. The
works of JEHOVAH<i> are </i>great, sought out of all them that have <span class="underline">pleasure</span>
therein.  </p>

<p>This is the &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; spoken of in Ecclesiastes 12:1.  We
are to make our calling and election sure and we are to seek the Lord before:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;  </p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12:2 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:  </p>

<p>Whenever we read in the Bible of the sun or the moon or the
stars being darkened, it is speaking of Judgment Day when there will be no
Gospel.  </p>

<p>Over the years, we have read Mathew 24:29 over and over again. 
Matthew 24:29 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  </p>

<p>In the Bible, the sun often spiritually represents Christ. 
In the book of Malachi, He is called &ldquo;the Sun of righteousness.&rdquo;  But, again,
when this day comes, there will be no more Christ for this creation.  &ldquo;The moon
shall not give her light,&rdquo; and God speaks of the moon in the Bible as a
representation of the Law of God.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 13.  We read in Isaiah 13:9-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, the day of JEHOVAH cometh, cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners
thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the
moon shall not cause her light to shine.  </p>

<p>There are many, many places in the Bible that speak of the
sun being darkened, the moon not giving her light, and the stars not shining.  </p>

<p>The stars are a representation of the true believers who
bring the Gospel.  This is going to be cut off because God&rsquo;s people are going
to be taken up.  There will be no Gospel in this world at that time.  What a
horrible thought.    </p>

<p>Let us go on in Ecclesiastes 12.  Again, it says in
Ecclesiastes 12:2:  </p>

<p class="verse">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:  </p>

<p>This does not seem to make sense.  Usually when the clouds
come, then the rain comes; but, again, I believe that this is speaking
spiritually of Judgment Day.  Ever since the creation of this earth, God has
been bringing the Gospel and He likens it to rain spiritually.  </p>

<p>One place that we know this from is found in Isaiah 55:10-11:  
</p>

<p class="verse">For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and
bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my
word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but
it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper <i>in the thing </i>whereto
I sent it.  </p>

<p>So we can see how God likens the Gospel to the rain; but
here in Ecclesiastes 12:2, it speaks of the clouds returning &ldquo;after the rain.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>We have recently heard Mr. Camping teaching how the clouds
relate to God in Judgment.  It says in Revelation 1, &ldquo;Behold, he cometh with
clouds&rdquo;; and it says in Revelation 10:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
with a cloud: and a rainbow <i>was </i>upon his head, and his face <i>was </i>as
it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:  </p>

<p>When we read of Him coming in the clouds, the Bible is
speaking of the Lord coming in judgment.  God is often associated with being in
the cloud, which is actually speaking of the Word of God as it judges mankind. 
</p>

<p>This is what Ecclesiastes 12:2 is saying where He refers to
the clouds returning.  God returns in judgment when this &ldquo;rain&rdquo; ends, the rain
of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12:3 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who are &ldquo;the keepers of the house&rdquo;?  They are those to whom
God has entrusted the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Now that the church has become apostate, we have been
commanded to leave the church; and yet those in the churches are &ldquo;the keepers of
the house.&rdquo;  They are going to understand that they are under the wrath of God
and they are going to be terrified as they see &ldquo;those things which are coming
on the earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Zechariah 3.  This is the passage about Joshua
standing before the Lord &ldquo;clothed with filthy garments&rdquo; with Satan at his right
hand protesting.  After this, we read in Zechariah 3:6-7:    </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel of JEHOVAH protested unto Joshua, saying, Thus
saith JEHOVAH of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my
charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and
I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.  </p>

<p>Those who are &ldquo;the keepers of the house&rdquo; are like the tribe
of Levi.  The tribe of Levi was, in one sense, a picture of all of the true
believers.  The keeping of the house and ministering in the tabernacle and in
the temple was assigned strictly to the house of Levi.  This tribe was a
picture of the New Testament church, the pastors and the elders and the
teachers, all of those who had rule or authority in the church.  They are &ldquo;the
keepers of the house,&rdquo; but the day is going to come when &ldquo;the keepers of the
house&rdquo; are going to be trembling.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:3 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the strong men shall bow themselves&hellip;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong men&rdquo; is sometimes translated as &ldquo;men of valour&rdquo; or &ldquo;men
of wealth&rdquo; or &ldquo;men of strength.&rdquo;  Again, this is referring to those who have
corporately been assigned the wealth of the Word of God.  Again, they are the
keepers of it, and yet judgment is coming upon them and they are going to be
trembling in fear.  This will cause them to &ldquo;bow themselves.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;bow&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;overthrown&rdquo; or &ldquo;turneth upside
down,&rdquo; as we read in Psalm 146:9.  Psalm 146:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">JEHOVAH preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
and widow: but the way of the wicked he <span class="underline">turneth upside down</span>.  </p>

<p>This is the same word for &ldquo;bow&rdquo; in Ecclesiastes 12:3. 
Again, this speaks of being overthrown in judgment.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:3 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
strong men shall bow themselves&hellip;  </p>

<p>They will be overturned.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the grinders cease because they are few&hellip;  </p>

<p>Grinding has to do with grinding grain between the
millstones so that flour might be made.  If you search this out in the Bible,
this is actually a figure of doing the work of the Gospel.  This is referring
to a time when the sound of the Gospel is ceasing because the Gospel will no
longer be going out.  </p>

<p>It says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the grinders cease because they are few&hellip; </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;few&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;diminished&rdquo; in other
places in the Bible.  This is all speaking of judgment on God&rsquo;s people.  Here,
it is looking at the corporate church, to those who should have been bringing
the Word of God and doing the work of getting the Gospel out.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:3 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble&hellip;  </p>

<p>This will be May 21<sup>st</sup> when judgment begins.  It
continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,  </p>

<p>We normally install windows in houses for light.  In the
Bible, &ldquo;window&rdquo; is often used as an access to Heaven.  When the flood began in
Genesis 7, it speaks of how &ldquo;the windows of heaven were opened.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>God also uses the word &ldquo;windows&rdquo; in Malachi 3.  Malachi 3:10 says:    </p>

<p class="verse">Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse&hellip;  </p>

<p>We see here a commandment to &ldquo;bring [<i>our</i>] tithes into
the storehouse.&rdquo;  Our &ldquo;tithes&rdquo; are actually a representation of the true
believers.  As we work to get the Gospel out, it is as if we are bringing in
God&rsquo;s people.  We are vessels who carry the Word of God.  In doing so, we are
bringing people &ldquo;into the storehouse.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;tithes&rdquo; represent this.  </p>

<p>Turn to Isaiah 66:20, which also tells us this.  This is
speaking of the Gentiles being brought in.  Isaiah 66:20 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And they shall bring all your brethren <i>for </i>an offering
unto JEHOVAH out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters,
and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith
JEHOVAH, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the
house of JEHOVAH.  </p>

<p>As God&rsquo;s people are doing His work by getting tracts out or
putting these billboards up or any of these other things that they are doing to
get the Word out, they are being used of God to bring the tithes in, to bring
believers into His storehouse.  </p>

<p>So Malachi 3:10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith JEHOVAH of hosts, if I
will not open you the windows of heaven&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here is that same word &ldquo;windows&rdquo; again.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out
a blessing, that <i>there shall </i>not <i>be room </i>enough <i>to receive it.</i> 
</p>

<p>But here in Ecclesiastes 12:3, the Gospel is ending.  It
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and those that look out of the windows be darkened,  </p>

<p>This is because there is no longer any light.  The Gospel
has ended.  There are four different figures just in this one verse that speak
of how the Gospel is going to come to an end.  </p>

<p>This theme continues in the next verse, Ecclesiastes 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the doors shall be shut in the streets&hellip;  </p>

<p>Who is the &ldquo;door&rdquo;?  Christ is the door.  Again, the Gospel
will be cut off.  This word for &ldquo;streets&rdquo; is often translated as &ldquo;way&rdquo; in the
Bible, but the door shall be shut in the streets.  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;when the sound of the grinding is low&hellip;  </p>

<p>Again, &ldquo;the sound of grinding&rdquo; is made as wheat is being
ground into flour, which is a picture of doing the work of the Gospel; but now &ldquo;the
sound of the grinding is low.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Then we read in the second part of Ecclesiastes 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
daughters of music shall be brought low;  </p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall rise up.&rdquo;  This is speaking of God in judgment. 
He refers to Himself in many places in the Bible as being asleep and then
awakening to judgment.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 7.  Psalm 7:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Arise, O JEHOVAH, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <i>to </i>the judgment <i>that </i>thou
hast commanded.  </p>

<p>This is the desire of all true believers.  It is not that
vengeance might be brought on these evil people around us, but that the Lord&rsquo;s
will might be done in judgment.  In other places in the Bible, He also speaks
as if He is sleeping and He is going to awaken to judgment.  </p>

<p>So we read again in Ecclesiastes 12:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;he shall rise up at the voice of the bird&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for bird denotes a small, defenseless bird, like a
swallow or a sparrow, which should be the characteristic of a true believer. 
We are like a small and harmless animal that really needs God as his defense
and that cries to God for His help.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 102.  This particular word for bird was for a
clean bird that could be offered in a sacrifice.  It is a picture of the true
believers.  We read in Psalm 102:7-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. Mine
enemies reproach me all the day; <i>and </i>they that are mad against me are
sworn against me. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping, Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me
up, and cast me down. My days <i>are </i>like a shadow that declineth; and I am
withered like grass. But thou, O JEHOVAH, shalt endure for ever; and thy
remembrance unto all generations. Thou shalt arise, <i>and </i>have mercy upon Zion:
for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.  </p>

<p>There are also other places in the Bible where this word for
bird is used.  This is speaking of the true believer.  </p>

<p>This reminds me of the account in Luke 18 of the woman and
the unjust judge.  Luke 18:1-7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end, </i>that men
ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge, which
feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city; and
she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And he would not for a
while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard
man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge
saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
him, though he bear long with them?  </p>

<p>This verse is saying a lot when it says that He &ldquo;bear long
with them.&rdquo;  In His longsuffering, He is even bearing long with us; but He is
finally going to avenge His own elect when He comes, and they are crying &ldquo;day
and night unto him&rdquo; for His vengeance to come.  Though, again, we are not
wishing for vengeance on those around us, because this is where we came from. 
We simply want the Lord&rsquo;s will to be done in judgment.  This is like those &ldquo;under
the altar&rdquo; in Revelation who are asking, &ldquo;How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost
thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Returning to Ecclesiastes 12, it continues speaking of the
same thing in the next verse.  We read in Ecclesiastes 12:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Also <i>when </i>they shall be afraid of <i>that which is </i>high&hellip; 
</p>

<p>In the book of Luke, we read about how mankind is going to
be terrified by the things that will be going on on this earth.  This word &ldquo;high&rdquo;
means exalted and this is speaking of God.  </p>

<p>Look at Ecclesiastes 5.  Ecclesiastes 5:8 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <i>he that
is </i>higher than the highest regardeth; and <i>there be </i>higher than
they.  </p>

<p>This is speaking of how God is exalted and high.  </p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes 12:5, it says that there is going to be a
time when:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;they shall be afraid of <i>that which is </i>high, and fears <i>shall
be </i>in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish&hellip;  </p>

<p>Some of us may be familiar with Numbers 17.  This is when God
told Moses to tell the Israelites that one prince from each of the twelve
tribes was to take a rod, a piece of a tree branch.  After their rebellion in
the wilderness, God was going to show the Israelites who His chosen people
were.  We know that Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded.  Aaron was of the tribe of Levi.  He
was the first high priest.  Aaron&rsquo;s rod budding was a figure of those who would
be chosen to be God&rsquo;s people.  Again, Aaron was of the tribe of Levi.  </p>

<p>So the almond tree is speaking of God&rsquo;s corporate people,
those in the church, but now we read in this verse:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;and the almond tree shall <span class="underline">flourish</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>But the almond tree at this time is not going to flourish,
because we are reading of how judgment will come on the church; so what does
this mean?  Actually, this Hebrew word for &ldquo;flourish&rdquo; is used about twenty-five
times in the Old Testament.  Outside of this verse, it is never translated as &ldquo;flourish&rdquo;;
it is most often translated as &ldquo;provoke&rdquo; or &ldquo;blaspheme.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 52.  I guess that the King James&rsquo; translators
just could not understand how &ldquo;the almond tree&rdquo; could &ldquo;blaspheme&rdquo; or &ldquo;provoke.&rdquo; 
We read in Isaiah 52:5:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now therefore, what have I here, saith JEHOVAH, that my people
is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith
JEHOVAH; and my name continually every day <i>is </i><span class="underline">blasphemed</span>.  </p>

<p>This is that same Hebrew word.  It means &ldquo;to blaspheme,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;to flourish,&rdquo; which fits in perfectly with what the rest of Ecclesiastes 12 is
saying.  It also fits in perfectly with what we understand about the 153 days
as God has opened our eyes to &ldquo;time and judgment.&rdquo;  Those in the church are not
going to be repenting.  During that time, they are still going to be
blaspheming and cursing God once they realize that they have not been raptured
and that they are not God&rsquo;s people.  It is just a horrible thing to contemplate
that &ldquo;the almond tree&rdquo; is going to blaspheme God in that day.  </p>

<p>Let us read Ecclesiastes 12:5 again.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Also <i>when </i>they shall be afraid of <i>that which is </i>high,
and fears <i>shall be </i>in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish [<i>or
blaspheme, or abhor, or contemn, or provoke</i>], and the grasshopper shall be
a burden&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; can also be translated as &ldquo;locust.&rdquo; 
All throughout the Bible, grasshoppers are usually associated with a plague,
like they were in Egypt.  In Revelation, we also read how locusts at that time
will be a plague.  Again, everything is fitting right in.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail&hellip;  </p>

<p>The desire of a true believer, of a child of God, is the
Lord Jesus and the truth of the Gospel, but this desire will fail:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
the streets:  </p>

<p>This phrase &ldquo;man goeth to his long home&rdquo; is actually
referring to eternity.  &ldquo;The mourners go about the streets&rdquo; because there is
mourning.  </p>

<p>Look at Job 34:13-15.  This is Elihu speaking about God.  It
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed
the whole world? If he set his heart upon man, <i>if </i>he gather unto himself
his spirit and his breath; All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn
again unto dust.  </p>

<p>In other words, the spirit of every person who ever existed
is in the hands of God.  This is what this is saying.  </p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes 12:7, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
spirit shall return unto God who gave it.  </p>

<p>We always need to speak of the sovereignty of God and give
all of the glory to God.  </p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes 12:6, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken,
or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.  </p>

<p>This is continuing on along the same vein.  The Gospel has
ended.  &ldquo;The silver cord&rdquo; speaks of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 12.  Psalm 12:6 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The words of JEHOVAH <i>are </i>pure words: <i>as </i>silver
tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.  </p>

<p>At that time, the silver cord is going to be broken.  </p>

<p>Look at Hosea 11.  In Hosea 11:3-4, we read:  </p>

<p class="verse">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they
knew not that I healed them. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of
love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
laid meat unto them.  </p>

<p>Who is this &ldquo;man&rdquo;?  This is speaking of the cords of Christ,
of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>It says again in Hosea 11:4:  </p>

<p class="verse">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto
them.  </p>

<p>But this is speaking of the rebellion of the children of Israel. 
</p>

<p>So the silver cord is loosed in Ecclesiastes 12:6, which is
referring to the Gospel being cut off.  Ecclesiastes 12:6 continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the golden bowl be broken&hellip;  </p>

<p>There were bowls on the lamp stand that we read about in
Zechariah that held oil.  Again, this was a figure of the Gospel.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;or the pitcher be broken at the fountain&hellip;  </p>

<p>The Israelites got their water from fountains or from
cisterns or from streams, but now the pitcher is broken.  Again, this is a
picture of the Gospel being cut off.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;or the wheel broken at the cistern.  </p>

<p>A cistern was a pit hewn out in rock that would catch rain
water.  I do not know this for sure, but on the deeper cisterns they probably
had some kind of wheel that would allow them to lower a bucket, like a well
that you see on an old farm; but now this wheel is broken at the cistern. 
Again, the water of the Gospel is not available.  </p>

<p>So over and over again, God is just driving this home in
this chapter.  How many times have we read figures in these verses of the
Gospel being cut off?  </p>

<p>Then in Ecclesiastes 12:7, God says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
spirit shall return unto God who gave it.  </p>

<p>We read in Genesis that we are formed out of the dust of the
earth.  He has given us our spirit and it is in His hands.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:8 then says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all <i>is </i>vanity.  </p>

<p>This is the theme of the whole book of Ecclesiastes.  All of
the pursuits of man in this world are vanity.  Whatever does not glorify God is
vanity.  </p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12:9 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
people knowledge&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are still in the day of salvation.  The Word of God is
still going out.  &ldquo;Knowledge&rdquo; is pointing to the Word of God.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, <i>and </i>set in order
many proverbs.  </p>

<p>Again, this is speaking of His Word.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:10 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and <i>that
which was </i>written <i>was </i>upright, <i>even </i>words of truth.  </p>

<p>This is also speaking of His Word.  </p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12:11 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">The words of the wise <i>are </i>as <span class="underline">goads</span>, and as nails
fastened <i>by </i>the masters of assemblies, <i>which </i>are given from one
shepherd.  </p>

<p>The &ldquo;words of the wise,&rdquo; the Bible, &ldquo;<i>are</i> as goads.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Acts 9 speaks about the conversion of Paul.  The Lord said
to Paul at that time, &ldquo;<i>It is </i>hard for thee to kick against the pricks.&rdquo; 
Let us read this.  Paul is on his way to Damascus to bring Christians back to
be beaten, killed, or imprisoned.  We read in Acts 9:3-5:  </p>

<p class="verse">And as he [<i>the Apostle Paul</i>] journeyed, he came near Damascus:
and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to
the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest: <i>it is </i>hard for thee to kick against the <span class="underline">pricks</span>.  </p>

<p>This is the New Testament word for the word &ldquo;goads.&rdquo;  These
were long sharpened sticks.  When a farm animal became stubborn, they would get
poked with one of these goads.  God likens &ldquo;the words of the wise,&rdquo; His Word,
to these goads.  He told Paul that in his rebellion he was kicking against the
goads.  He was resisting the true Word of God.  </p>

<p>So Ecclesiastes 12:11 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">The words of the wise <i>are </i>as goads, and as nails fastened
<i>by </i>the masters of assemblies, <i>which </i>are given from one shepherd. 
</p>

<p>He is likening the Word of God to nails, &ldquo;<i>which </i>are
given from one shepherd.&rdquo;  Of course, this is referring to the Lord.  </p>

<p>Look at Isaiah 22.  This is speaking of Christ.  We read in
Isaiah 22:22-23:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;
so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And
I will fasten him <i>as </i>a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a
glorious throne to his father&rsquo;s house.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:11 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">The words of the wise <i>are </i>as goads, and as nails fastened
<i>by </i>the masters of assemblies, <i>which </i>are given from one shepherd. 
</p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12:12 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
books <i>there is </i>no end; and much study <i>is </i>a weariness of the
flesh.  </p>

<p>Then it says in Ecclesiastes 12:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter&hellip;  </p>

<p>This could be the bottom line of the whole Bible; but
throughout the whole book of Ecclesiastes especially, Solomon is examining the
vain pursuits of man.  He is saying that it is all vanity and emptiness.  We
are to glorify God.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:13 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;matter&rdquo; is Strong&rsquo;s #H1697.  It is the Hebrew
word <i>dabar</i>, which is the word for &ldquo;word.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>So He says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter&hellip;  </p>

<p>Or the issue, the subject; it is often translated as &ldquo;thing.&rdquo; 
This is referring to the Word of God.  </p>

<p class="verse">Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
keep his commandments: for this <i>is </i>the whole <i>duty </i>of man.  </p>

<p>Then Ecclesiastes 12 concludes in Ecclesiastes 12:14, which
says:  </p>

<p class="verse">For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
thing, whether <i>it be </i>good, or whether <i>it be </i>evil.</p>

<p>Chapters like this are just becoming more and more clear as
God continues to open up His Word to us as we approach the end.  </p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 12:9 says again:  </p>

<p class="verse">And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
people knowledge&hellip;  </p>

<p>He teaches us through His Word.  Judgment is coming.  The
proofs are just overwhelming.  We have to attempt to prepare ourselves.  We
have to now remember our Creator &ldquo;in the days of thy youth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>We know that we cannot do this because salvation does not
work this way, but all throughout the Bible we have verses like what we read in
Isaiah 45:22.  Isaiah 45:20-25 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye <i>that are
</i>escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of
their graven image, and pray unto a god <i>that </i>cannot save. Tell ye, and
bring <i>them </i>near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared
this from ancient time? <i>who </i>hath told it from that time? <i>have </i>not
I JEHOVAH? and <i>there is </i>no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour;
<i>there is </i>none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of
the earth: for I <i>am </i>God, and <i>there is </i>none else.  I have sworn by
myself, the word is gone out of my mouth <i>in </i>righteousness, and shall not
return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely,
shall <i>one </i>say, in JEHOVAH have I righteousness and strength: <i>even </i>to
him shall <i>men </i>come; and all that are incensed against him shall be
ashamed. In JEHOVAH shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall
glory.  </p>

<p>We read in other places in the Bible that every knee is
going to bow and that every tongue shall swear that Jesus is Lord.  We know
that this is spiritual because we know that there is not going to be a
resurrection to any kind of life for those who have died, for the unsaved; but
when God&rsquo;s people are taken up, this is going to be a judgment against them. 
In this way, this will be a confession to truth and that God is Lord of all.  </p>

<p>In His mercy, it is still the day of salvation.  All
throughout the Bible, we read verses like what we read in Isaiah 55:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">Seek ye JEHOVAH while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto JEHOVAH, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our
God, for he will abundantly pardon.  </p>

<p>God says, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.&rdquo; 
Verses like this are all throughout the Bible.  </p>

<p>Look at Psalm 50:14-15.  This says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
High: And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me.</p>

<p>Again, in His mercy, it is still the day of salvation.  He
has given us the privilege of being able to go to Him in prayer constantly and
simply beseech Him for His mercy.  To God be the glory.  </p>

<p>We will stop here.  </p>
