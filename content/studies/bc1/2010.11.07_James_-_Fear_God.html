<p>I am pretty sure that everyone can relate to a brother or a
sister whom we have at home.  I have had the Judgment Day signs on my car for
quite some time.  My brother has never said anything about this to me until
recently.  As the time is getting closer, maybe he is getting a little uneasy
about this.  He said to me that no man could know the day or the hour, which is
typical of most people of the world.  </p>

<p>So I would like to go to 1 Corinthians 2.  This is a little
detour from my study, but I wanted to bring this out because my brother does
not really study the Word of God or show any appearance of being saved.  This
is something that I have been thinking about, so I wanted to point this out. 
We read in 1 Corinthians 2:9-11:  </p>

<p class="verse">But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
that love him. But God hath revealed <i>them </i>unto us by his Spirit: for the
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth
the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things
of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  </p>

<p>This phrase, &ldquo;Even so the things of God knoweth no man,&rdquo; is
one of the things that I thought of when my brother said that we could not know
the things of God that pertained to the end times; but as we read on, it says
in 1 Corinthians 2:12-13:  </p>

<p class="verse">Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to
us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&rsquo;s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual.  </p>

<p>God has instructed us that no man knows the things of God,
but God reveals these things to us through the Holy Spirit.  This is what I
tried to emphasize to my brother.  I tried to say that no man knows the things
of God, but God reveals things to us through the Holy Spirit; and that we are
in the time when God is opening up the Scriptures, like we read about in
Daniel.  When Daniel wanted to know about end-time things in Daniel 12:4, God
said:  </p>

<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even
</i>to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased.  </p>

<p>God is revealing many things to us in this day and in this
time that we are living in.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Revelation 14:7 and we will begin our study. 
We read in Revelation 14:7:    </p>

<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, <span class="underline">Fear</span> God, and give glory to
him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  </p>

<p>God is saying in this verse that we are to fear God.  When I
searched this word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; out, it has to do with being afraid.  In many other
verses, this word is used in the context of being afraid.  </p>

<p>God says that we are to &ldquo;give glory to him.&rdquo;  How do we give
glory to God?  We honor and praise God through our obedience as God is working
in us.  We read about this in Philippians 2:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his
</i>good pleasure.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Matthew 14:27 where the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; is used
in a different context, but it is still illustrating to be afraid.  We read in
Matthew 14:27:  </p>

<p class="verse">But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
it is I; be not <span class="underline">afraid</span>.  </p>

<p>This is the Greek word <i>phobeo</i> and it is the same
Greek word that is also translated as &ldquo;fear.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Matthew 28 where we read about Mary
Magdalene as she went to see the body of Jesus.  We read in Matthew 28:6-10:  </p>

<p class="verse">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen
from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye
see him: lo, I have told you. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with
fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. And as they went
to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came
and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not
<span class="underline">afraid</span>&hellip;  </p>

<p>Here again we see this same Greek word that has been
translated as &ldquo;fear.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee,
and there shall they see me.  </p>

<p>In these verses, God is illustrating the word &ldquo;fear.&rdquo;  It is
not a bad thing to be afraid.  As God&rsquo;s people fear God, this initiates action
in our lives.  We will see this in our lives.  </p>

<p>Let us also look at Luke 12:4, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I say unto you my friends, Be not <span class="underline">afraid</span> of them that
kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.  </p>

<p>This is also the same Greek word for &ldquo;fear.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>At this time of great tribulation, God puts a fear in His
people.  We see a lot of things that are going on in the lives of God&rsquo;s
people.  People are going on tract trips.  As Ezekiel 33 says, they are
sounding the trumpet.  God&rsquo;s people have this fear that He has put in them.  As
a result of God putting this fear in them, we see that they show obedience to
God.  </p>

<p>Let us now go to Jeremiah 32:40.  We will see here that God
talks about the fear that He puts within His people.  God says here:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will
not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their
hearts, that they shall not depart from me.  </p>

<p>We see here the fear that God puts within His people.  God
tells us that He will not depart from us and that He will put this fear in our
hearts so that we will do what He will have us to do.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Genesis 22:1-2.  We read here about the story
of Abraham when he went to offer up his son Isaac.  We read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
Abraham&hellip;  </p>

<p>This word for &ldquo;tempt&rdquo; means &ldquo;to test.&rdquo;  It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said,
Behold, <i>here </i>I <i>am.</i> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only <i>son
</i>Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer
him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee
of.  </p>

<p>I am not going to read through this entire account.  Let us
move down to verse 11.  We read in Genesis 22:11-12:  </p>

<p class="verse">And the angel of JEHOVAH called unto him out of heaven, and
said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here <i>am </i>I. And he said, Lay not
thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know
that thou fearest God&hellip;  </p>

<p>God had instructed Abraham to offer his son Isaac up for a
sacrifice.  Abraham took a knife and was ready to plunge it into his son.  Then
we see here that God sent the angel of Jehovah who instructed Abraham not to
lay his hand upon the lad.  Then God said, &ldquo;I know that thou fearest God,&rdquo;
because Abraham was being obedient unto God.  </p>

<p>Then we read in Genesis 22:18 where God said to Abraham:  </p>

<p class="verse">And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
because thou hast obeyed my voice.  </p>

<p>The true believers obey the Word of God.  They act in
obedience to God, but there are some accounts of when true believers were not
obeying God.  We see then that God chastened them, like He did to David.  He
chastened Jonah because he fled from God to Tarshish.  Jonah tried to flee as
far away as possible.  We also read of how Jonah offered himself to be thrown
overboard.  I believe that this was God&rsquo;s way of chastening Jonah.  In the
account of David, David suffered great chastisement when he committed
fornication.  God chastened him and then David repented.  We know this story of
David who was a child of God and how he repented.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Exodus 9:12-21.  We read here:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
unto them; as JEHOVAH had spoken unto Moses.  </p>

<p>Before I move on, this verse says:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH hardened the heart of Pharaoh&hellip;</p>

<p>Many people try to use this verse to say that God caused
Pharaoh to sin; but, by nature, mankind is in rebellion against God and God
restrains sin in mankind.  God also lifts His hand of restraint off of man. 
Because man wants to sin by nature, when we see a phrase like &ldquo;Jehovah hardened
the heart of Pharaoh,&rdquo; we know that God did not cause Pharaoh to sin.  I just
wanted to point this out because some people read this verse and think that God
caused Pharaoh to sin.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">And JEHOVAH hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
unto them; as JEHOVAH had spoken unto Moses. And JEHOVAH said unto Moses, Rise
up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith
JEHOVAH God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. For I
will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants,
and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that <i>there is </i>none like me in
all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. And in
very deed for this <i>cause </i>have I raised thee up, for to show <i>in </i>thee
my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.  </p>

<p>We see in this verse that God is saying that He raised
Pharaoh up that He may be &ldquo;declared throughout all the earth&rdquo; and be
glorified.  God is the One who raises people up.  He raised EBible up and He
raised Family Radio up to use for His own purpose that He may be glorified.  </p>

<p>It continues:  </p>

<p class="verse">As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
not let them go? Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof
even until now.  </p>

<p>What do we see in this verse?  We see time and judgment. 
Many people say that we cannot know time and judgment, and yet God has
illustrated this all throughout the Bible.  We see this in Genesis when God told
Noah, &ldquo;For yet seven days&hellip;and every living substance that I have made will I
destroy from off the face of the earth.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>He is saying here:  </p>

<p class="verse">Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even
until now. Send therefore now, <i>and </i>gather thy cattle, and all that thou
hast in the field; <i>for upon </i>every man and beast which shall be found in
the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them,
and they shall die.  He that feared the word of JEHOVAH among the servants of
Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: And he that
regarded not the word of JEHOVAH left his servants and his cattle in the
field.  </p>

<p>We see that &ldquo;he that feared&rdquo; had his servants flee, but
there were some who &ldquo;regarded not the word of Jehovah.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>As we read on, we will see that God rained hail down on
them.  We read in Exodus 9:24-26:  </p>

<p class="verse">So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it
became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that <i>was
</i>in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
field, and brake every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the
children of Israel <i>were, </i>was there no hail.  </p>

<p>I was looking at Exodus 9:20, which says:  </p>

<p class="verse">He that feared the word of JEHOVAH among the servants of Pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:  </p>

<p>I was trying to find some evidence that these people were
saved because it says that they &ldquo;feared the word of Jehovah,&rdquo; but I could not
find any evidence that suggested that they were saved people.  They were
servants of Pharaoh.  I looked for this but I was not able to find any evidence
that they were saved.  </p>

<p>Let us read another account of God&rsquo;s people who trust in
God.  They have a fear of God to where they trust in God.  Let us go to 2
Chronicles 20:2-4:   </p>

<p class="verse">Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and,
behold, they <i>be </i>in Hazazontamar, which <i>is </i>Engedi. And Jehoshaphat
feared, and set himself to seek JEHOVAH, and proclaimed a fast throughout all
Judah. And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask <i>help </i>of JEHOVAH:
even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek JEHOVAH. </p>

<p>We see that there was a great multitude that was coming
against Judah.  Jehoshaphat feared and the first thing that he did was he looked
to the Lord for help.  In our times of trouble, I believe that God is letting
us know here that we are to spiritually go to Him.  </p>

<p>In 2 Chronicles 20:12, we go on to read:  </p>

<p class="verse">O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do:
but our eyes <i>are </i>upon thee.  </p>

<p>Jehoshaphat is trusting in the Lord that the Lord would
deliver them.  He said:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for we have no might against this great company that cometh
against us&hellip;  </p>

<p>We see that God says in 2 Chronicles 20:15:  </p>

<p class="verse">And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith JEHOVAH unto you, Be not
afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle <i>is </i>not
yours, but God&rsquo;s.  </p>

<p>We are familiar with the song, &ldquo;The Battle Is Not Yours.&rdquo; 
God is showing us this here:  </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;for the battle <i>is </i>not yours, but God&rsquo;s.  </p>

<p>In this great multitude that was coming against Judah, we
will see that neither Jehoshaphat nor any of the people of Judah had to lift a
hand.  </p>

<p>God says this in 2 Chronicles 20:17:  </p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall not <i>need </i>to fight in this <i>battle: </i>set
yourselves, stand ye <i>still, </i>and see the salvation of JEHOVAH with you, O
Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:
for JEHOVAH <i>will be </i>with you.  </p>

<p>Let us go to verse 22 where God talks about how He delivered
them.  We read in 2 Chronicles 20:22:  </p>

<p class="verse">And when they began to sing and to praise, JEHOVAH set
ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were
come against Judah; and they were smitten.  </p>

<p>We see that as the true believers go out into the world to
spread the Gospel, sometimes we might feel like there is a lot that is battling
against us; but we know that we can always go to the Lord.  We do not have to
lift a finger.  God will fight our battles for us.  He teaches us that the
battle is not ours; it is His.  </p>

<p>Let us go to Job 1:1:  </p>

<p class="verse">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was </i>Job;
and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and <span class="underline">eschewed</span>
evil.  </p>

<p>This word &ldquo;eschewed&rdquo; is the same word that is used in Job
28:28 where it is translated as &ldquo;depart.&rdquo;  We read in Job 28:28:  </p>

<p class="verse">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that <i>is </i>wisdom;
and to <span class="underline">depart</span> from evil <i>is </i>understanding.  </p>

<p>God gives us a Biblical definition for the &ldquo;fear of the
Lord.&rdquo;  He says that this is &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo;  Then He says that &ldquo;to depart from evil <i>is</i>
understanding.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>There is another verse that is somewhat in the same context
as Job 28:28.  We find this in 2 Timothy 2:19.  It says:  </p>

<p class="verse">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the
name of Christ depart from iniquity.  </p>

<p>This is a somewhat similar context to Job 28:28:   </p>

<p class="verse">&hellip;the fear of the Lord, that <i>is </i>wisdom; and to <span class="underline">depart</span>
from evil <i>is </i>understanding.  </p>

<p>There are great blessings in the lives of true believers who
are obedient to God and faithful to God&rsquo;s Word as God works through them.  </p>

<p>Let us look at a couple of these verses.  We read in Psalm
115:13:  </p>

<p class="verse">He will bless them that fear JEHOVAH, <i>both </i>small and
great.  </p>

<p>God gives us assurance that His people will be blessed,
those that fear Him.  God has placed this fear in those who are His.  </p>

<p>Let us also go to Psalm 145:19:  </p>

<p class="verse">He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
hear their cry, and will save them.  </p>

<p>God is going to move in His people.  His people will cry out
to Him and God will save them.  </p>

<p>I am pretty sure that we are all familiar with the account
of Noah in Hebrews 11.  Hebrews 11:7 says:  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith&hellip;  </p>

<p>We know that Christ is faith.  </p>

<p class="verse">By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he
condemned the world&hellip;  </p>

<p>Noah &ldquo;moved with fear.&rdquo;  Noah understood what was going on. 
He received this message from God and this was what was actually seen in his
life.  Noah built the ark and warned people.  We know that he was a &ldquo;preacher of
righteousness.&rdquo;  Because of this, we can know that he was warning people.  </p>

<p>This says that Noah &ldquo;moved with fear.&rdquo;  As a true believer,
we should be moving with this same fear that Noah was moved with.  We should be
like the ant and not like the sluggard.  A sluggard is slothful and lazy, but
we should be like the ant and be busy handing out tracts or doing whatever we
can.  God&rsquo;s people are going to do this because God is going to move in them. 
God is going to accomplish His will and He is going to will them to do the
things that He wants them to do.  </p>

<p>I am going to close with reading Revelation 14 again.  We
read in Revelation 14:6-7:  </p>

<p class="verse">And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear
God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come&hellip;  </p>

<p>We are in the time of great tribulation where God is
commanding us to spread His Gospel to all nations, kindreds, and tongues.  God is
using a lot of means to accomplish this.  He is using shortwave radio and the
Internet.  His people are getting busy.  They are putting signs on their cars. 
His people are doing a lot of things and God is magnifying even the smallest
thing.  We know that His will is going to be accomplished.  </p>

<p>Let us close.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
