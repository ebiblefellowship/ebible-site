Starting Wednesday, August 19, 2015 the phone number used for the conference dial-in
has changed to **641-715-3650**.

Other changes are:

* The *Flash Phone* is now called the *VoIP Dialer*.
* The Skype gateway is no longer supported. The only way to use Skype is to have a paid
  plan and dial in or just use the free *VoIP Dialer*.
* Apps for Android and iPhone are available.
