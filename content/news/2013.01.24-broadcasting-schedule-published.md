*EBible Fellowship* has recently implemented a radio automation system for broadcasting
to the Bible Teaching web stream and *EBible Fellowship* Paltalk room.  This new functionality
allows us to schedule most all programming in advance and consequently, 
[publish a schedule](<%= base_url %>/schedule/) which is updated in real-time.  
There is also a web based player on this page that can be used to listen to the broadcast
without opening an external player or Paltalk.
