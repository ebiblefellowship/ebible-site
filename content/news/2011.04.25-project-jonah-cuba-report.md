# Missions Report for Cuba

Good morning brothers and sisters in Christ,

By God grace 8 of us arrived in [Cuba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba) 
on April 18TH. Upon arriving at the airport, the customs agents asked us 
many questions, such as why are we here. Once we told them that we were 
missionaries who came to share the message of May 21, 2011, immediately the 
told us that since we came into the country as tourist, we were not allowed to 
perform any religious activities. Then we left the airport on our way to our 
destination wondering now how are we going to share the message.

The next day some of us wore our T-shirts, therefore many natives asked 
us questions. Later on that day we got to speak to one of the chief 
investigators of the town we were in (santiago de Cuba), she told us some 
of the ways we can share the gospel. We gave out many booklets, and tracts 
to the natives. This morning, we went to the police station to be sure what 
the rules were concerning handing out the message, and they told us they 
have no problem. 

Yesterday we went to the city of Guantanamo. Most people received the message 
very well with no arguments.

We have one more day please keep us in your prayers. Matthew 24:14 And this 
gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto 
all nations; an then shall the end come.

 To God be all the glory. We know that God is in control, may His will be done.
