# Missions Report for Sri Lanka

## Introductory Letter

Dear Brethren:

Greetings to you all in the Name of our Blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ.  We had a wonderful time of tract distribution in Sri Lanka,
The group has pass out over 23,000 tracts in only one week. The reception
has been outstanding and only a scant few tracts were discarded. We had
almost zero opposition and the people there are very receptive and seem
eager to hear about our message to God&rsquo;s coming judgment upon the World.

Here are a few photos of our mission.  I have sent over 50 photos to FR
for them to upload to the Project Jonah website which they promise to
do so shortly.

I hope everybody is doing well. Please pray for our mission, that we
may remain fruitful and faithful til the end. May God&rsquo;s Blessings and
Mercy be upon all of you.

In His Holy Name

Brother Paul

## Missions Report

[Sri Lanka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka)
is an island-nation situated in the Indian Ocean, off the
south-eastern coast shores of India. Spread over an area of approximately
65,525 sq km, the country forms a strategic naval link between West Asia
and South East Asia. 70% of the population in Sri Lanka follows Buddhism,
followed by Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. The official languages of
Sri Lanka are Sinhala and Tamil. However, English is widely spoken in
the country.

Sri Lanka was the first stop on Project Jonah’s Asian tour after
splitting off from the African Tour in Tanzania.  Four ambassadors of
Christ settled in the heart of Sri Lanka for one week to pass out 23,000
Judgment Day tracts.

Because of the dual indigenous languages of Sinhalese and Tamil, Sri
Lanka was perhaps the most challenging country on the tour yet to pass
out tracts in.  There is no real way to distinguish between who spoke
Sinhalese or Tamil. The tracts were printed up in both languages as well
as in the English language.

While displaying tracts in all three languages, the missionaries would
ask each person which language they spoke to be sure they received a
tract in the appropriate language.  This process slowed down the process
of tract distribution, however it provided an opportunity to personally
engage with each individual and often sparked in-depth discussions about
God’s Word, salvation through Christ alone, and judgment upon the world.

### Hardly anybody refused a tract

Hardly anybody refused a tract and almost none were thrown away.

Most people in Sri Lanka were eager to receive a tract and were very
interested in the subject matter of God’s coming Judgment.

“What should I do?” or What does this mean?” were two common
questions.

“Salvation through Christ is coming to an end on May 21, 2011. That’s
only four months away. There is still time to cry out to God for mercy,
but not much. After May 21, God will bring judgment upon the world and
the earth will be destroyed with earthquakes and burned up with fire.”

“Do you mean that I only have four months to live?!” one young girl
exclaimed.

“You only have four months to cry out to God for mercy!” the missionary
replied.

“Then salvation is finished and God’s judgment upon the world will
begin. This world will be burned up with fire then God will re- create
a new heaven and earth wherein dwells righteousness and only those who
have been saved through the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ.”

The missionaries were often aw-strucked by the message that they were
bringing to the people of Sri Lanka.

The missionaries were able to pass out every single tract in all three
languages with very little resistance.

One small exception was a situation at the university where the
missionaries were granted permission to pass out tracts just outside
the entrance gate.  A missionary was posted at each gate. While the
majority of students and faculty who passed by did receive a tract,
one small group of students were displeased by the tract distribution.

### "This is a Buddhist country!"

“Excuse me, who said you can pass this out?” one student
asked. “This is a Buddhist country!”

The missionary knew that Sri Lanka had religious freedom and only 70%
of Sri Lankans follow the Buddhist faith.

“It’s Okay, we’ve already have permission and have spoken to the
authorities” the missionary explained.”

The students phoned the police who informed the missionaries to stop
passing out tracts around the university.

The missionaries dutifully obeyed the police and returned to their hotel;
however, they had already spent the entire morning passing out tracts
around the university. About 3,000 tracts were passed out in just that
one morning.

Overall, the people of Sri Lanka were very peaceful and accepting of
the missionaries and their message of God’s coming judgment. The
missionaries feel certain that God will reap a bountiful harvest of
souls in this placid country.

Other than a few awkward social adjustments such as having to eat with
their hands, not being able to drink the water and having to wait an
hour and a half for the next train, Sri Lanka is a beautiful Island
Country with summer-like weather year round, splendid ocean views and
fresh tropical fruits.
