A series of articles entitled, [Let my People Go!](/archives/2011/10/02/the-four-messengers/) has been posted.  It is based on excerpts from the series, 
[The End of the Captivity to Sin and Satan](/archives/2011/07/03/the-end-of-the-captivity-to-sin-and-satan-part-1/).

Many other site updates have been made such as a new [Spanish home page](/es/)
with translated studies, transcripts for [recent studies](/studies/)
and some [studies in Job](/archives/2011/06/24/job-1-part-1).  Also, many studies
now have their associated videos attached.
