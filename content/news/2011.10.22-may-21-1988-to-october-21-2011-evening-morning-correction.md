The audio from the [Question and Answer from yesterday evening along with notes](/archives/2011/10/21/questions-and-answers/)
has been posted making a correction to our understanding of May 21, 1988 to October 21, 2011 to use evening-mornings instead of morning to evening. Also, the delay of one day in the appearance of the new moon as an indicator of the start of the new month in both 1994 and now in 2011.

The audio and video are also available at <http://fridaynightstudy.com/archives/1209>.
