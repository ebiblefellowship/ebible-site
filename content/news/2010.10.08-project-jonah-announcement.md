Recently, Mr. Camping announced the start of a new missionary plan called "Project Jonah."
Family Radio will send missionaries to various countries around the world.  Unlike previous 
mission trips, this project will allow missionaries to remain deployed for extended periods 
of time.  Please pray that God will open doors in countries that are currently closed to the 
true gospel.
