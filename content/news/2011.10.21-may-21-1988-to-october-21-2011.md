One of the brethren with great understanding of the Biblical calendars created a spreadsheet 
showing every day from May 21, 1988 to October 21, 2011 using both inclusive and non-inclusive 
methods of counting.   This shows that the 153<sup>rd</sup> day ends on sunset October 22<sup>rd</sup> 
(Tishri 23) Jerusalem time.

This spreadsheet is available in several formats:
