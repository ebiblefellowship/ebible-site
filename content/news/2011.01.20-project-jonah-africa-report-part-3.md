# Missions Report for Tanzania

## Introductory Letter

Dear Brethren in the Lord:

I&rsquo;m absolutely stunned by how quickly time has been passing along.  I
hope everybody is doing well by God&rsquo;s Mercy.  We just spent two weeks
in Tanzania and the reception there has been amazing. I have now moved
on to Sri Lanka to begin and then on to Cambodia to bring the news of
God&rsquo;s impending judgment and hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Here is a report I wrote for Mr. Camping.  I enjoy hearing from you
and your activities in serving our Lord in these exciting times.  I
hope the Lord has Mercy on each one of us and reaps a bountiful
harvest.

Brother in Christ

Paul

Here is my report

## Tanzania: January 10, 2011

Not exactly the dream vacation spot, but 
[Dar es Salaam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam),
[Tanzania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania)
was the next destination for Family Radio’s Project Jonah mission team.
Dar es Salaam is Tanzania&rsquo;s most important city for both business and
government. The city contains unusually high concentrations of trade,
manufacturing and other services compared to other parts of Tanzania.
Christians, Muslims and followers of indigenous beliefs each make up
one third of the population.  
[Zanzibar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar) is over 99% Muslim and the
coastal areas on the Indian Ocean are predominantly Muslim, especially
around Dar es Salaam.

For two weeks, five ambassadors of Christ took up residence in the
heart of Tanzania to bring the good news of salvation through Christ
and God’s impending judgment upon the world on May 21, 2011, a mere 4
months away.  The missionaries have distributed over 110,000 judgment
day tracts throughout the various markets, ferry and bus terminals.

The group’s standard protocol was breakfast at 7 AM; teams of two would
load up with 2,000 tracts a piece and head out to the market place;
the teams would break for a quick lunch at noon, reload with another
4,000 tracts and head back out for the afternoon.  The missionaries
would gather for dinner and to discuss the day’s activities as well as
make plans for the next day.  This was usually followed by
administrative duties, an informal bible study and a good night’s
sleep.

### ...the missionaries could not pass out the tracts fast enough

Literally, the missionaries could not pass out the tracts fast enough.
They disappeared like water in the hot African Sun. Mobs of people
would often spill out into the streets stopping traffic as they waited
to receive Judgment Day tracts. Busloads of commuters would pull to
the curbside so that the passengers could each receive a tract. A
missionary would then run up to the bus and pass tracts through open
windows to eagerly waiting hands.  Motorcycles would often screech to
a halt so driver and passenger could both receive a judgment day
tract.  Merchants would run out from their shops, leaving customers
waiting, in order to receive a tract. The missionaries had to be at
the top of their game in order to keep the morning commute going.

Often, tracts would be snatched from the missionaries’ backpack before
they could get them out. Even tracts that were dropped to the ground
were quickly picked up by somebody else.

“Hey Mista, give a paper to me!” was a common call.

> “THE END OF THE WORLD IS ALMOST HERE! HOLY GOD WILL BRING JUDGMENT DAY
> ON MAY 21, 2011”

This was the message the ambassadors brought to the people of
Tanzania. It definitely aroused curiosity, anxiety, anger, joy and
astonishment among the masses bustling to and fro in the busy markets.

### This was not a mission for the faint of heart

This was not a mission for the faint of heart.  You had to be both
physically and mentally fit; capable of standing out in the baking sun
all day, navigating craggy, rugged and steep terrain with a heavy
load; being exposed to unpleasant sights, odors and potentially
dangerous situations, dealing with mobs, and prosecution from both
individuals and the authorities.

At times, passing out tracts in Tanzania could be almost overwhelming
with people poking, grabbing, running, reaching, and calling at you
from all directions. The missionaries were often presented with
complex questions concerning God’s judgment upon the world and
salvation.

A typical provocative and misunderstood verse was Mark 13:32 which
states “But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
angels which are in heaven, neither the Son but the Father.”   This
mission required consistent study of God&rsquo;s Holy Word with the patience
and desire to teach.

Many people sincerely asked for the solution to God&rsquo;s impending judgment.

 “What can I do in only four months?” one young man asked at one of
the busy markets. This was a commonly asked question.  This is where a
clear and accurate understanding of God’s Word is critical because
there is nothing anyone could do to escape God’s judgment except for
God’s Mercy. Even to believe in Christ as savior is a work of God as
stated in John 6:29. Believing in Jesus Christ is a gift from God.

> “Cry out to God for Mercy with a broken and contrite heart as the
> publican did in Luke 18, this is all we can do,” said the missionary
> to the young man. “And maybe God will have mercy upon you.”

“Oh yes, OK! I will do that,” he said, and he meant it as he neatly
folded his tract and tucked it into his pocket.

One missionary team moved on to Kariakoo Market which is just a few
blocks from their hotel. This was mostly a produce market of corn,
mangos and everything that grew from the ground. The merchants had
their goods spread out in baskets, barrels and under tents.

While enroute to the Kariakoo Market, a vendor raced up to one of the
missionaries waving one of his newspapers.

“Mista, Mista, you in da pappa!” he exclaimed.  “Look at this!”

### There they were on the front page of the biggest newspaper in Tanzania

There they were on the front page of the biggest newspaper in
Tanzania; a big color photo with the headline, “Judgment Day, May 21,
2011; could this be the truth?”
The article stated that a certain group was planning a town meeting to
discuss the details of the tract the missionaries were distributing to
the populace.

A flurry of people from all around approached the missionaries asking
for more tracts for them to share with friends, family and coworkers.
God seemed to be using the newspaper article to blast the warning of
His coming judgment upon the world.

The missionary bought the newspaper, stuffed it into his backpack and
continued onto the market, handing out tracts to everybody on the way.

Once they arrived at the Kariakoo Market, the missionaries began
weaving in and out of the tents and stalls handing out tracts to
anybody who wanted them. Everybody did it seemed.

“Hey give me one!”

Children would race up to them for tracts which they could take back home.

“Psst, Psst, over here!”

Sometimes just a wink or a nod or an outstretched hand was all that
was necessary for somebody to request a tract.  Kariakoo Market was a
typical day of tract distribution in the baking sun of Tanzania; or so
they thought.

### Three police officers approached the missionaries

Three police officers approached the missionaries as they were passing
out the tracts at the busy market place.

“What is this you have here?”

“Who gave you permission to pass these out?” they asked.

They spent about five minutes reading over the tract as people continued
to approach the missionaries for more tracts.

A crowd of defiant merchants and shoppers gathered around the officers
as they questioned the missionaries. They wanted more tracts and were
displeased with the officers who were stopping their tract
distribution.

“You’ll have to come with us!” the officers demanded and ordered the
missionaries to go with them to their office and to cease from passing
out anymore tracts.

The officers seemed to be mindful of the displeasure they were
arousing among the people by stopping the missionaries from handing
out tracts. They suddenly took on a very polite and courteous demeanor
so as not to upset the crowd even more so.

The missionaries dutifully obeyed and followed the officers to their
headquarters at the edge of the market. They were reminded of a
previous episode in Dakar, where they were detained by the Political
Police for over 10 hours, placed under house arrest and instructed to
leave the country. They wondered if this was the end of their mission
in Tanzania.  However, the Lord would not have it.

### The missionaries prayed earnestly

The missionaries prayed earnestly as they filed into the officers’
tiny overheated office just outside the Kariakoo Market where they
were passing out tracts. The officers collected their passports and
began a litany of probing questions of their purpose in Tanzania.

“Oh dear God, with you all things are possible and we are here to
serve you. Let your perfect will be done,” one of the missionaries
prayed.

The officers began to carefully read the tracts that the missionaries
were passing out to the populace out in the marketplace.

One of the missionaries opened his backpack and pulled out the
newspaper which featured them in the headlines. The newspaper article
showed that the tracts were being passed out all over Dar es Salaam
and the city was eagerly reading them, asking for them and wanted more
discussion about God’s impending judgment upon the world.

“Here officer, here we are on the front page news” one of the
missionaries offered the newspaper to the police officers to read.
They read the article and tracts and looked back up at the
missionaries after a long 10 minutes of awkward silence.

### If this is from God, then of course you can pass out tracts

“Well, if this is from God, then of course you can pass out tracts
here in the marketplace and anyplace else that you wish. We are sorry
for interrupting you. Please go ahead and distribute,” one of the
officers said with a big toothy smile.

Without further ado, the police officers released the missionaries
from detention with full approval to continue their work.

Once back out in the marketplace, the merchants and shoppers made a
short work of the remaining tracts the missionaries had in their
backpacks.

The ferry terminal is always an ideal place to pass out tracts.  In
one afternoon, two missionaries passed out over 4,000 tracts at the
terminal alone.  The ticket agent let them into the waiting area
without having to purchase boarding tickets.  The setup couldn’t be
more perfect. The team stood beside the turnstile and quickly handed a
tract to all the passengers as they funneled into the waiting area. It
was soon filled to capacity and each passenger was studiously reading
over the judgment day tract while waiting for their ferry to arrive.

The missionaries would then move to the opposite side of the waiting
room to hand out tracts to the disembarking passengers on the arriving
ferry. This scenario repeated itself throughout the afternoon and was
an easy way to disperse tracts throughout all of Tanzania.

Finally, just as the team depleted its supply of judgment day tracts,
a security officer ordered them to leave the ferry terminal. That was
not an issue because the team’s backpacks were depleted and they were
done for the day anyway.

### This mostly Muslim city seemed to have been waiting...

Passing out judgment day tracts in Dar es Salaam did not require an
elaborate game plan at all. This mostly Muslim city seemed to have
been waiting for them and accepted the news of God’s impending
judgment very very seriously.

The citizens were often seen studying the tracts in coffee shops,
while commuting to and from work, while eating lunch or riding in a
taxi. School kids and adults alike did not hesitate to ask for
additional tracts to share with friends and family.

At various times, the missionaries were approached by concerned
individuals who had additional questions about God’s judgment on the
world on May 21, 2011 and what supporting scriptures could be offered.
These Q&A sessions would often evolve into full blown Bible studies in
the open market or at the local bus stop. These studies would continue
daily with a larger crowd each time. One individual brewed a giant
kettle of tea to serve to the missionaries and fellow Bible students.
A couple followed the missionaries back to the hotel where the Bible
study would continue for several more hours.

### Mobs of people raced from all directions for more tracts

Occasionally, a team would spend the day just passing out tracts
outside the hotel lobby or a little ways down the street from the
hotel while mobs of people raced towards them from all directions for
more tracts and with more questions about salvation.

One young man tried earnestly to receive a tract from one of the
missionaries, but was pushed aside by the rushing crowd that quickly
snapped up all of the tracts before he could get one. With an empty
backpack dangling from his shoulder, the missionary finally stood
face-to-face with the disappointed young man as the crowd dispersed.

“Do you have a paper for me!?” he asked.

“I’m sorry, I have no more tracts left,” the missionary said.

As the young man looked to the ground, he spotted one tract in a
puddle of water that had been trampled upon by the rushing crowd. That
tract was for him.

### He carefully lifted the muddied tract from the water puddle

He carefully lifted the muddied tract from the water puddle, folded it
into his pocket, then went back home with a huge grin on his face.
