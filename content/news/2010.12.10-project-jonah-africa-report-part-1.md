# Missions Report for Dakar, Senegal in Africa

Hello Everybody

I just want to extend a hello from Dakar Africa.  We 
have just completed our first week here and hear this, Dakar, Senegal has heard the Gospel 
and they have been told of the Lord&rsquo;s imminent return in May.  We have been handing 
out tracts to all parts of the city and outer regions and it has been such a huge success. 
Here is the report I wrote for Mr. Camping.  I am so grateful for all of your prayers and 
support and would love to hear from all of you at home. Just let me know how you are doing 
and what is new with you.  I was very happy to hear about the billboards. Please, please,
please pray for the people in Africa.  They really need to hear the Gospel, and we have 
been meeting up with a lot of resistance from the Muslim groups, however we are not letting 
them deter us from our mission.  Thank you all for your support and prayers.  I am off to 
Camaroon on Sunday, then the Serengeti, Eventually I will be traveling all over Asia and 
Australia. May the Lord be with us all. Amen.  Here are some pics you might enjoy.

In Christ&rsquo;s Love

Brother Paul

Here is my report for Mr. Camping.  I hope to hear from you soon.  XXOO

Faster than a cheetah in the Serengeti, I&rsquo;ve earnestly peeled off and placed a tract 
into each of the hundreds of yearning, stretching, reaching hands that eagerly surrounded
me in the main plaza of Dakar University. “The End of the World is Almost Here!” 
“No Man Knows the Day or the Hour?”  “The Rapture Will Occur on May 21, 2011. 
These were the truths those hands were reaching for.  The crowd of students and staff 
swelled to five, six and seven layers thick. “Is this for real!?,” They shouted.  
“How do you know this!?” “This cannot be possible!” some uttered with disbelief as they 
filed into their morning classes with their judgment day tracts folded neatly in their 
pockets or backpacks.  The missionaries were an enigma to them; Americans chosen by God 
to bring a peculiar message of doom to the people of Africa; the message that judgment 
day was less than six months away. What was thought to be a full day supply of gospel 
tracts whittled down to nothing in only two hours as hundreds of eager hands quickly 
snapped up our message. It was time to head back to the ‘Saint Louis-Sun Hotel” to restock.

One of the missionaries said, “As I passed out the judgment day tracts at Dakar 
University, I would often be struck with wonder and amazement by the message I 
was bringing to the African people. This was for real; I was walking in the shoes of 
Jonah. I was amazed that God has chosen me to carry out this wonderful and glorious 
task. All other factors of my life have faded into an obscure insignificance compared 
to the task the Lord has set before me&mdash;to bring the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ to the African people.

A Family Radio group of nine “Ambassadors for Christ” from various parts of the US 
arrived in [Dakar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar) the capital city of 
[Senegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal) 
in Africa on Thursday, December 1st on a tract distribution trip. They 
plan to proclaim the Gospel of Christ until May 21, 2011 and warn the people of Africa 
of the imminent return of Christ and the closing door of salvation in these last few 
remaining days.  

The nine missionaries will be joined by others in January and the group will be 
splintered into various mission groups heading to Asia, Europe and South America.  

One of the missionaries proclaimed, “My life was one of the lives chosen to do 
this glorious work. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m any more special than anybody 
else. This is just my calling. I think of Jonah and the Ninivites or the thief on 
the cross who were saved at the “last minute” I’m privileged to be a part of 
this work, but I don&rsquo;t feel it is a seal on my life. I&rsquo;m just here 
to add to God&rsquo;s number of chosen people. ”

There were many shocking and bewildering encounters the missionaries have experienced 
in Dakar. In one particular village they refer to as “Tin Can Alley” they came upon 
a villager who had just skinned a goat. The skinless goat was hanging from a hook 
in one area; its skin was spread out to dry in the hot sun in another area. A woman 
prepared a large kettle of boiled fish that was covered in flies which she just 
stirred into her brew. The stench of rotting flesh and fecal matter continuously 
permeated the hot humid air. This was certainly not a task for the faint of heart.

One missionary said “I thought about my delightful rose-garden I left back in New 
York, but still would not trade this experience for anything else.  I&rsquo;m on 
a mission from God and this is the most glorious work imaginable.”

One missionary was surrounded on a busy street corner by a group of angry Muslims. 
They were irate by the gospel tracts being handed out and felt their turf was being 
invaded. Being concealed from view by vendor carts, the Muslims cornered the 
missionary and angrily threatened bodily harm.  The missionary was rescued by 
another Muslim man who pulled him aside and began to point to the purple scarf 
he was wearing around his neck.  He did not speak, he just pointed to his throat.  
Then he pulled away the scarf to reveal his tracheotomy through which he tried to 
speak. Instead he just gave off a sputtering, gurgling sound. The missionary just 
pointed out the Family Radio website. He handed the missionary a necklace that he 
made before he walked off clutching his gospel tract.

Leaving the comforts and privileges of a pampered life in the United States, the 
nine missionaries set out on a one-way flight across the Atlantic to a place they 
knew nothing or very little about.

“Being here is a great honor.” One of them said. “We were appointed by God 
to bring this awesome message to these people. The people here are very eager 
to get the tracts.  The cars and taxis pull over or just block traffic so that 
the driver can receive one of our tracts; the kids run down the street after us; 
scooters and bicycles hit the brakes to receive a tract.  These people have a 
lot of questions. We are a total curiosity to them. They want to know why we 
are here and are ready to hear what we have to say. Many deformed and maimed 
people still managed to get tracts from us. They would not be deterred. One 
guy had no legs, but he dragged himself over to us so that he might receive a 
tract. People in wheelchairs also approached us to get a tract.

We have handed out thousands of tracts in one day, but only picked up a scant 
few from the ground. These people are ready to listen.

Dakar is extremely hot and dry. The African people are very friendly-helping 
out with our baggage and all. We were very well received by the African people. 
The Atlantic Ocean is beautiful. Some people here try to express the true 
meaning of hospitality, while others look for every opportunity to defraud us 
and scam us and to really cause us great harm. Some people have tried to lure 
us into dark alleys and secluded areas where they intended to do us great harm. 
However, God is a very present help in times of need and we can actually sense 
the Lord&rsquo;s protective hand keeping us safe.”

Some of the sites and experiences in Dakar have been rather unsettling; however 
the work in getting out the Gospel to the African people has gone unscathed. 
One team member recounted how he might look a little strange to the African 
people as he stood on the street corner bringing a message of doom and gloom. 
”If I were one of them, I&rsquo;d wonder what was wrong with me too!” he said. 
“But I&rsquo;d certainly check into what he was saying.”

One woman was given a gospel tract and was shown the Family Radio website where 
she can get additional studies and gospel material. Afterwards, she was approached 
by another missionary who began to witness the gospel to her. She pulled out 
and waved her Bible in the air as she jubilantly cried out with gleaming eyes 
“Halleluiah, the apocalypse.” They opened her Bible, which was one of her few 
possessions, to Psalm 119:20 where the team member pointed out a verse about judgment.

“We re-confirmed what she already knew,” said the team member, “that the end 
of the world was near. She asked us to pray for her. She had a problem with 
her eyes, but despite here physical ailments, she was joyous, with tears 
streaming down her cheeks, that a couple of believers have brought her the gospel.”  

Another one of the missionaries also recounted his experience in Dakar, Africa, 
“My first impression of Africa is just how blessed and spoiled we are in the 
United States of America. Just the simplest things like water, electricity and 
transportation are not to be so easily found here in Africa. The African people 
are very friendly people and seem as if they are really hard workers. I have 
much compassion for those deprived of their physical needs, but the deprivation 
of the Spiritual knowledge and acceptance of Jesus as Lord and God is much more 
of a burden to me.

I am thankful that God has allowed me to be here and be a small part in spreading 
His Word here in Africa, to sound the warning about His coming Judgment Day,” 
said one of the missionaries.
