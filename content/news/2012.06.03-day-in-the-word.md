This Sunday, June 10, 2012 *EBible Fellowship* is hosting a "Day in the Word."
There will be a series of Bible studies and one Q&A session.  

__Time__: 10 AM to 5 PM EST with a break for lunch

__Location__: The union hall where *EBible Fellowship* has met in the past.  See these 
[Directions](<%= base_url %>/join/live/directions/).

__Speakers__: Chris McCann, Robert Daniels and Gunther von Harringa, Sr.

As we no longer have our own internet connection at the Union Hall, 
we are investigating on ways to broadcast the event via the internet and by phone/Skype but this 
has not been formalized yet. Assuming broadcasting can be arranged, it should be possible
to listen in the following ways:

* Paltalk and web streams [Broadcasts, Live](<%= base_url %>/join/broadcasts/)

* Phone/Skype conference [Broadcasts, Phone Information](<%= base_url %>/join/phone/)

* During the Questions and Answers segment, questions will be taken live, or via text on Paltalk.

In any case, recordings will be made and posted on the web site.
