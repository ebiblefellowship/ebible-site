Retired the old server used by the site for more that eight years and 
replaced it with several virtual servers improving performance and also
cutting costs.  As part of this transition, we haven't posted anything to the 
website for the past few weeks while new processes are developed.  Lord 
willing, we'll get caught up soon.

While we work on getting new content published, the following changes have
been made:

* New section on home page that shows all recent studies, questions and 
  answers no matter where they have been published on the site.

* All new Sunday studies will be published in a Studies, Sunday area.  

* All new Sunday Open Forums will be published in a Questions, Sunday area.

* New Friday studies and questions areas have been created as a place
  to post many of the Friday studies and Open Forums.
