<h1>Welcome to the Electronic Bible Fellowship</h1> 
<h2>(also known as EBibleFellowship or EBF)</h2>

<p class="body"><br />EBibleFellowship was named for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="body"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Electronic:</span></b> We believe that the Lord is using the electronic medium (radio, internet, etc.) in a tremendous way to save a great  multitude of people outside of the churches and congregations of the world.</p>

<p class="body"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bible:</span></b> The Bible is our authority. No man made confession, or creed, or doctrinal statement of any kind has any authority above the Bible.  We are living at a time when the Bible is being highly exalted by God.  The Word of God is supreme in all it declares.</p>

<p class="body"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fellowship:</span></b> We are a fellowship of believers whose desire is to have fellowship with God through His Word.  The Bible teaches us that the church age has come to an end; therefore, we have no affiliation or identification with any church or denomination of any kind.</p>

<p class="body">Thank you for visiting.</p>

<p class="body"><br /><b>1 John 1:3</b> That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
