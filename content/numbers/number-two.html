<h1>Study on the Number Two</h1><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The number two is frequently used in the Bible in connection with the bringing of the Gospel or with those who are supposed to be the proclaimers of the Gospel.  </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The two witnesses of Revelation Chapter 11 represent the going forth of the Gospel during the Early Rain. </p>

<p>The two witnesses mentioned above are also spoken of as the two olive trees:</p>
<p class="verse">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.&rdquo;
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 11:4)</span></p>

<p>The trees represent the believers:</p>

<p class="verse">;The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted
  <span class="verseref">(Psalm 104:16) </span></p>

<p class="verse">For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
  <span class="verseref">(Isaiah 55:12) </span></p>

<p>And it is the believers who are responsible for going into all the world with the Gospel. </p>

<p>The two witnesses mentioned above are also spoken of as the two candlesticks:</p>
<p class="verse">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 11:4) </span></p>

<p>The candlesticks represent the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s presence at work within the churches:</p>
<p class="verse">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 2:5) </span></p>

<p>This is because the candlestick represents the light source which is Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
  <span class="verseref">(John 5:9) </span></p>

<p>Christ is the Word of God in flesh:</p>
<p class="verse">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
  <span class="verseref">(John 1:14) </span></p>

<p>Therefore the light, represented by the two candlesticks, identifies with the Gospel. The candlesticks identify with the churches and it is the churches' primary job assignment to spread the Gospel. </p>

<p>Jesus sent out 70 people &ldquo;two by two&rdquo; to share the Word of God:</p>
<p class="verse">After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
  <span class="verseref"> (Luke 10:1) </span></p>
