<h1>Study on the Number Three</h1><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The number three is found frequently in the Bible. 
  It would appear that we could say the number 3 in the Bible signifies God&rsquo;s plan. It&rsquo;s sort of a vague definition, but the number three lets us know that whatever happened wasn&rsquo;t by chance. God intended it to occur for His own purpose.</p>

<p>We find the number three used repeatedly in connection with the atonement:</p>
