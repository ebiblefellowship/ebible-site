<h1>Study on the Number Four</h1><br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>God often uses the number four to signify all-encompassing. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Satan&rsquo;s deceitful work spreads through the entire world:</p>
<p class="verse">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth.
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 20:8)</span></p>

<p>God gathers his people from all over the planet: </p>
<p class="verse">And he shall send his angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to another.
  <span class="verseref"> (Matthew  24:31) </span></p>

<p>The number four can be used in connection with the points of a compass which covers all possible directions: </p>
<p class="verse">In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
  <span class="verseref">(1 Chronicles 9:24) </span></p>
<p class="verse">On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 21:13) </span></p>

<p>When warning of the destruction that God plans to bring upon the entire land of Israel He speaks of it as a destruction that will come upon the four corners of the land:</p>
<p class="verse">Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
  <span class="verseref">(Ezekiel 7:2) </span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;four corners of the land&rdquo; is another way of saying the &ldquo;whole land&rduo;:</p>
<p class="verse">Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will  pluck up, even this whole land.
  <span class="verseref">(Jeremiah 45:4) </span></p>
<p class="verse">Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD&rsquo;s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
  <span class="verseref">(Zephaniah 1:18)</span></p>
<p class="verse">They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
  <span class="verseref">(Jeremiah 12:11) </span></p>

<p>We saw in the above paragraph that the desolation was in the &ldquo;whole land.&rdquo; God also speaks of this desolation as being &ldquo;four sore judgments&rdquo; through &ldquo;four kinds,&rdquo; all of which is an illustration of total destruction in the whole land: </p>
<p class="verse">For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
  <span class="verseref">(Ezekiel 14:21) </span></p>
<p class="verse">And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts  of the earth, to devour and destroy.
  <span class="verseref">(Jeremiah 15:3) </span></p>

<p>God lists four synoyms of &ldquo;people&rdquo; to signify all people: </p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
  <span class="verseref">(Revelation 17:15) </span></p>

<p>In <span class="verseref">Zechariah 6:1-5</span> we read about the four chariots which represent the four spirits of the heavens that go forth from the Lord of all the earth.</p>
