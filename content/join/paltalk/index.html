  <h2 class="large">Installing the Paltalk Messenger software</h2>
  
  <p>Installing the Paltalk Messenger software will enable you to
listen to our Sunday messages and ask questions during the 
<a href="../live/"><cite>Open Forum</cite> and
<cite>Fellowship Hour</cite> times</a>.</p>

<p>Speakers, headphones or headset are needed to listen.  During Bible
Q&amp;A times, questions can be asked with a microphone or entered by text.</p>

<p>To install the Paltalk Messenger, simply go to the
<a href="http://www.paltalk.com"><em>Paltalk Messenger Download</em></a>
web site and follow the instructions for signing up as a new user.
As part of that process, you will be instructed to download and install
the Paltalk Messenger software.</p>

<p>However, currently, the Paltalk
Messenger can only be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows&trade;. 
Machines running other operating systems such as Apple OS X or Linux are not
currently supported although Paltalk now mentions on their web site that a
Mac version is, &ldquo;coming soon.&rdquo;
In the meantime, Mac OS X and Linux users running Intel or AMD processors
should have success running under a virtual machine such as one by
<a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>.  However, this requires a
licensed copy of Windows&trade; as well.</p>

<p>Another option for OS X and Linux users that as of this writing
doesn&rsquo;t quite work is the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a> or 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com">CodeWeavers</a> CrossOver Mac/Linux
Windows compatibility layers.</p>

<p>In any case, one can listen over the corresponding MP3 or Ogg Vorbis streams
if there&rsquo;s one for the associated Paltalk Chat Room.</p>

  <h2 class="large">Running the Paltalk Instant Messenger the First Time</h2>

<p>Once you have the Paltalk Instant Messenger installed, start it,
create a nickname and login.  
Click the <em>Chat Rooms</em> tab.  Near the bottom of the window, enter
&ldquo;EBible&rdquo; (without the quotes) into the
<em>Search For Chat Rooms</em> search box and click the Search button. 
Double-click on the desired room name such as <em>EBible Fellowship</em>
or <em>EBible Reading Fellowship</em>.
Once you&rsquo;ve entered the 
room, add the room to the Paltalk Messenger Favorites to make it easier
to enter it in the future.  For the complete list of rooms maintained by

<em>EBible Fellowship</em>, <a href="../broadcasts/">check here</a>.</p>
