  <h2 class="large">Installing the Paltalk Messenger software</h2>
  
  <p>Installing the Paltalk Messenger software will enable you to
listen to our Sunday messages and ask questions during our 
<cite>Question and Answer</cite> times.</p>

<p>Speakers, headphones or headset are needed to listen.  During the Sunday morning Bible
Q&amp;A time, questions can be asked by raising your hand in the room, and entering your question into the
 chat box when called to. For the evening Q&amp;A times, go <a href="/questions/">here</a>
 for more information.</p>

<p>To install the Paltalk Messenger, simply go to the
<a href="http://www.paltalk.com"><em>Paltalk</em></a>
web site and download and install
the Paltalk Messenger software.</p>

<p>However, currently, the Paltalk
Messenger can only be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows&trade;. 
For machines running other operating systems such as Mac OS X or Linux, Paltalk
has a product called <a href="http://express.paltalk.com/">Paltalk Express</a>, a less
featured version of Paltalk Messenger that can run in your browser.</p>

<p>Mac OS X and Linux users running Intel or AMD processors
should have success running Paltalk Messenger under a virtual machine such as 
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/overview.html">VMware Player (free)</a>,
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html">VMware Fusion (for Mac OS X)</a>,
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox (free)</a> or
<a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels Desktop for Mac</a>.
However, any of these virtual machine solutions requires a licensed copy of Windows&trade; 
(Windows XP is adequate and uses less memory than newer versions).  
In addition, since around January 2012, a free Paltalk Messenger won&rsquo;t start up in a 
virtual machine due to &ldquo;security issues.&rdquo; Users must purchase a blue or green 
nickname for their Paltalk Messenger to enable it to start it in a virtual machine 
environment.</p>

<p>Another possible future option for OS X and Linux users that as of this writing in mid-2011
doesn&rsquo;t quite work for running Paltalk Messenger is the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a> or 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com">CodeWeavers</a> CrossOver Mac/Linux
Windows compatibility layers.  At some point, these environments may run Paltalk sufficiently
well to be useful.</p>

<p>In any case, one can listen over the corresponding MP3 or Ogg Vorbis streams
if there&rsquo;s one for the associated Paltalk Chat Room and all live events can
be heard via <a href="/join/phone/">phone or Skype</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="large">Running the Paltalk Messenger for the First Time</h2>

<p>Once you have the Paltalk Messenger installed, start it,
create a nickname and login. 
In the Paltalk Messenger window, click the <em>People</em> tab near the bottom of the window,
and change it to <em>Rooms</em>. In the search box, enter
&ldquo;EBible&rdquo; (without the quotes) and click the little magnifying glass icon. 
Double-click on the desired room name such as <em>EBible Fellowship</em>
or <em>EBible Reading Fellowship</em> to enter that room.
Once you&rsquo;ve entered the 
room, add the room to the Paltalk Messenger Favorites to make it easier
to enter it in the future. To do that, click the <em>Favorites</em> menu item close to the top
 of the room window and click <em>Add this Room to My Favorites</em>. For the complete list of rooms maintained by

<em>EBible Fellowship</em>, <a href="../broadcasts/">check here</a>.</p>
