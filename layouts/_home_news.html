		    <h3>October 20, 2011 &mdash; Having Had Mercy, Have Mercy!</h3>
			<p>We are living in a most unusual time. On May 21, of 2011, mankind entered into the Day of Judgment.
This &ldquo;day&rdquo; will last for 5 months (153 days) until October 21, 2011. The Bible is teaching us that this
period of time is Judgment Day!</p>

<h2 class="transcript" style="margin-left: 0; margin-bottom: 0.5em">The Completion of God&rsquo;s Salvation Plan</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The Bible declares that it was God&rsquo;s plan to save 200 million people out of all those who would ever live
upon the earth. Just prior to May 21 of this year, God finished the work of applying the redemption
Christ had purchased for His people before the foundation of the world. Just prior to May 21, 2011, the
Lord finished saving all of those whose names were written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life. This act of God in
finding all of His lost sheep and then finally gathering them and leading them safely into the sheepfold
of the Good Shepherd was accomplished right before May 21. On May 21, God then shut the door to
heaven, also known as the door to the sheepfold:</p>

<p class="verse" style="margin: 0 2em 1.5em 2em">John 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but
climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
